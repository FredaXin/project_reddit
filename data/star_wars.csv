2,About Cal Kestis,For real what is his age I have searched online plenty and i can only find out he was a padawan when the order happened and survived... padawan have a far range of ages and since fallen order takes place only 5 years after I dont think he was too young during the order I'm going to say at the very least he was 11 which makes him 16 in fallen order this seems fairly accurate but I think he's older.

3,Revan TV Show [Spoilers],"I think it the KOTOR should be a show broken into a few seasons.

The first season should be Bastila Shan being the main character hunting Revan and Malak.

It should end with Bastila’s Strike team capturing Revan while Malak is betraying him. It should be assumed Revan dead. You should never seen Revan’s face.

The second season should start the same way the video game did with a soldier on the crashing ship above Taris. 

Fans of the game will realize who he is, but it will be a great twist to the common person. 

The show could show flashbacks to the Mandolorian Wars at the same time the present day cast search for the star maps. 

It would allow for more time to develop the story , characters, and not rush it into 2 hour movies. 

It could also set up events similar to the Old Republic.

I am aware that is not canon anymore, but Revan is now and they should stick as closely to his story as possible.",StarWars,1577409997,ltite,3,1,True,2019-12-26
4,The lack of film on Disney's cutting-room floor is their biggest issue with the last two trilogy films,"Good art is often the product of a skilled and patient editing process.

Disney's editors could have easily cut out 40-60 minutes of The Last Jedi, and added some of the story from The Rise of Skywalker to keep it at 120 minutes:

* The evacuation from D'Qar and the Canto Bright sub-plots could have been completely eliminated, and instead just been a 10 minute cut of the evacuation, the abandon ship, Daryl Hannah lightspeed missiling their asses, and the rebels getting away. Done. That alone would have saved around 40 minutes. 
* Next, the Ahch-To island scenes. Luke really doesn't train Rey much, so we didn't get the Dagoboh and Yoda experience, so all we needed was their initial talk, Rey finding the books, confronting her dark side, and the connection with Ren being made. That would cut around 10-15 minutes more. 

Then take Rey training on Yavin 4, and Ren taking power and going and finding the wayfinder from ROS and add it to the end of TLJ. End the movie with the interception of a familiar but old voice, and a fleet of destroyers rising out of a planet's surface, and leave it there. That would tighten up TLJ and trim down ROS, and they wouldn't have had to add a single frame or line of dialogue. 

Herein lies my point. If a layman like myself, can think through editing those two films down better (yes, I am confident this would improve both), Disney should be able to handle finding professional editors who can do it for them. They likely have budgets for these films larger than the GDPs of some countries, so I don't see this being a big deal for them to invest in. It is imperative. Especially if they are going to keep pumping out movies so rapidly.",StarWars,1577410354,msilcommand,7,1,True,2019-12-26

6,"Now that The Skywalker Saga is over, where should Star Wars go?","I’ve really been wondering this ever since I saw the movie. Where does it go from here?

I’ve seen people say KOTOR, but I think that’s a terrible idea. As you can see, adapting things people have on a very high pedestal leads to very mixed results. I also think they should just declare the games canon. Just keep it as it is instead of adapting an already great story,

I think they should go to the future. A time where everything we’ve seen now is a distant memory. I think instead of creating something that fits into a larger story, there should be a new Saga made. Get a Feige like figure to oversee it and of course consult George Lucas. I think that’s be the best way to go.",StarWars,1577410480,Vadermaulkylo,38,1,True,2019-12-26

11,So how does Hyperspace Work in Star Wars?,"JJ Abrams had them go into hyperspace to dodge a shield like it was a wormhole trip, then obviously the Holdo manoeuvre is more in line with the notion that we have hyperspace lanes that are meant to be used because they are specific paths that are clear of obstacles otherwise you collide with things in real space (think they come from Legends too). Then in Star Wars Rebels, we have Hera trigger hyperspeed in a hangar to wreck the Tie Fighters as she exits.  Thrawn and in Rebels they use starships that disrupt hyperspace access. Then, JJ Abrams, has them say it was 'once in a million chance' 

So how does it work?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S It seemed obvious to me that the reason why you wouldn't use Holdo Manoveur regularly is that if you got limited ships and resources you just waste your ships and have no ships to actual win or fight in future battles so you wouldn't do it regularly.",StarWars,1577411090,HALdron1988,2,1,True,2019-12-26

16,WARNING SLIGHT SPOILERS FROM RISE OF SKYWALKER AND JEDI FALLEN ORDER. Rey's has psychometric powers,"So I've been promoting the idea since TFA that Rey isn't some all powerful Mary sue and that she has  the power of psychometry. I'm not the only one who thought this as I've read older posts from here and found others that agree for the same reasons around the time the last jedi came out. 

Examples:

Rey starts flying the falcon and can barely take off     but after a few minutes she is doing maneuvers straight out of Han Solo's playbook.

Rey seems to barely know to point and shoot when given the blaster. Later on she is taking out stormtroopers with single shots.

She experiences Kylos touch on her mind and begins  instinctively use the power against him and later mind controls the guard.

In the new movie she picks up the sith Dagger and begins to feel and see images and instantly figures out how to use it to find the Sith way finder. 

And of course the intense vision she has touching the lightsaber. Seeing the experiences of the owners of saber. 


Over the years people argued claiming that psychometry does not work that way. That they get only impressions. Which was argued from the yes and no because of the Quinlan Vos comics. He got  impressions from some but also saw experiences from others. He saw events play out through the force when he touched items. But those stories are no longer cannon and our only sight of psychometry was from the couple of clone wars episodes involving Vos. Which wasn't to much to go on. 

What changes things now was Cal Kestus' psychometric powers in Jedi Fallen Order. He got impressions sure but he touched Cere's guitar and he instantly knew how to play a song written by her. When touched items in the game he heard the voices of those tied to it. Cal also had full blow visions like Rey  from touching the inquisitor lightsaber that left him frozen. He experienced everything first hand that the Trilla went though as she was left by her master, captured and tortured, and her acceptance of the dark side in becoming an inquisitor. It was almost exactly what Rey went through with the Skywalker lightsaber.

Rey isn't a Mary sue. She gains abilities through the things she interacts with. The falcon, the sith Dagger,   the lightsaber and even the force around the Jedi island was experienced after she touched the stone as she reaches out with the force. It manifested mildly until the lightsaber and it full blown opened her up to the force afterwards.

19,A short comment on fan criticism &amp; George Lucas,"A post I see here often is ""They should have let Lucas make his sequel trilogy"" or ""Disney ruined everything by excluding George"" and so on.

what ive also come to realize is not a huge number of people in this forum are old enough to remember how poorly received the prequels were and how even in a pre-twitterverse world the utter disappontment and backlash was fierce. 

The reason there was no Sequel Trilogy from Lucas is because of how intense the backlash and criticisms of the prequels were. 

George Lucas often answered questions about future Star Wars movies with an emphatic ""No"" and also by saying 'Why would I make any more when all I get is criticism""  (paraphrasing)

Eventually he wanted to see his universe continue on the big screen but didnt have the want to be the creative force behind it and allowed another company to bear the firestorm he no doubt knew would come regardless of how good or bad these movies were.  And hes right.  

Everyone screaming for Lucas to have been directly involved likely would be the same people destroying him for many of the same reasons they sit and bash the sequel trilogy. 

Im glad the franchise I love isnt going to fade away. Im glad a company with the power and influence of Disney is allowing my childhood wonderment to be passed down to my own kids and someday grandkids.  Will they all be good? No. Will they all be bad? Surely not. Will I love that this universe will continue to grow?  Absolutely. 

Thats all. I know this will get removed shortly but I felt like getting it off my chest this evening.

27,My ideas for a Star Wars trilogy based on the story of Darth Revan. (Episode 1),"Out of creativity and bordem, here are my plans for a trilogy based on the story of Darth Revan. This is **VERY LOOSELY** based on KOTOR and their characters, not meant to follow the timeline or story for screen adaption. If we ever see KOTOR or Revan translated to the big screen we could probably expect a lot of changes along with probably his and everyone's name being changed. But for the purpose of people's interest, I'll keep the name as Revan. Also in the comments tell your own story, what you like/dislike and changes to this!!! 
              
**'Episode 1':**           
The opening crawl depicts that the great and powerful Jedi order reigns over the galaxy to maintain piece as they have in the hundreds of years since they destroyed their sworn enemy, The Sith. They are now at war with the Mandalorians. A Jedi known only as Revan leads what they hope is the final battle of War.         
        
The opening shows an all-out DDay style battle. The setting is a Mandalorian city located near the ocean. Jedi in swarms charge the forces of the city. Moving from the back of the Jedi swarm to front, one figure outclasses the other Jedi by a mile. It is Revan as he takes to the front slaying Mandalorian after Mandalorian, he dons the mask of a slain Mandalorian. The Jedi are now overwhelming the city in a Battle of Berlin style conquest. A Jedi comes to the side of Revan, his friend known as Malak. Back to back, they deflect blasters with their lightsabers, Malak discusses how this should be the final battle of the war. Revan says not until they get Mandalore the Ultimate. They both look up to the largest skyscraper in the city, as they see ships of retreating Mandalorians fleeing from and they know he is up there. After Malak questions how to get there quick enough, Revan grabs Malaks hand and jumps them both up unto an enemy fighter jet, slicing the cockpit open and force the pilot out. Revan and Malak fly up crashing into a platform and eventually making their way to the control room of the building where they confront Mandalore the Ultimate. Malak takes a blaster to his side and is defeated, Revan fights and eventually defeats him. Standing from the top of the skyscraper as the Jedi celebrate their victory.          
       
The War is now over as the Jedi return to their temple on Coruscant. Revan is being lauded as a hero by the citizens of Coruscant, but is uninterested, as his true interest is only in knowledge. Malak is jealous of the attention Revan receives and its revealed hes always been jealous of Revan for how much more powerful he is. Revan meets with The Jedi council and they explain how they are not happy with how he disobeyed the Jedi Order and created his own ""Jedi Army"" to defeat the Mandalorians. Revan feels disrespected, but really doesn't care and tells them the problem has been solved. Some time goes by and Revan and Malak are commissioned to visit the unknown regions where Mandalorian leaders may be hiding. They set off and start exploring the very dark unknown regions. They feel a pull to an evil Exigol-like planet and land there, where they are instantly ambushed and knocked out.             
         
They awaken in front of the Sith leader Darth Vitiate and he reveals how the Sith have been in hiding for centuries plotting to destroy the Jedi, Vitiate exclaims that Revan and Malak are the final piece in their puzzle and are destined to turn to the Dark Side and rule the galaxy with the new Sith Order. They refuse and sent to be tortured in prison. Days go by and Vitiate returns to them and tries to push them to the dark side, Malak agrees to join and leaves with Vitiate. Revan still refuses. More days go by and Vitiate returns with Malak. Vitiate now taunts how Revan is no longer needed and how much more powerful Malak has become through the knowledge of the Darkside. Revan is angered by this notion but curious with the Dark Side knowledge. Vitiate frees Revans of his constraints and lets him fight Malak to prove his point. Malak now outclasses Revan with his dark side powers and disarms Revan, Revan angered and humiliated is told by Vitiate to unleash his anger. Revan unlocks his anger, calls back his lightsaber and starts going ballistic on Malak, finally swinging his saber up and cutting his jaw clear off. Malak revels in pain as Revan is deemed Darth Revan.           
          
Malak undergoes surgery and they are both trained under Vitiate. Revan again shows himself to be the most powerful in the room as Malak's hate of him grows stronger than ever as he has no jaw and speaks like a droid. Finally, Revan and Malak are sent on separate missions to ignite the War with the Jedi. Revan is sent with an ancient Sith map to uncover the ""Star Forge"" an ancient device used during the first Sith War which drained energy from Suns and the Darkside to create droid armies, ships and weapons. Malak was granted the position of general and was to lead an assault on Coruscant to destroy the Jedi Temple. Malak was in command of 100 Sith along with their already substantial droid fighter army. They both departed separately to simultaneously carry out their missions.       
          
Revan returned to the ship he arrived on and headed to the Star Forge to reactivate it. Once Revan got out of the unknown regions, the tracker in his ship was closer and able to reconnect with Coruscant and his signal was sent to the Jedi. The Jedi believing he was dead after being gone for weeks sent 2 members of the Jedi Council (those two who had also scolded Revan for his Jedi army creation) and their 2 padawans to follow and recover his ship believing it may have been stolen.             
Revan arrives on the Star Forge and starts exploring it, and learning more ancient Sith history. Finally reactivating it as the machine becomes to drain the energy from the Sun. Revan heads to his ship as the Jedi ship lands. They are confused at where they are but excited to see Revan alive. Quickly the sense his darkness and the 2 Jedi Masters and their 2 padawans attack Revan. Revan quickly kills one padawan and one master. Then locks swords with the other two. They tell him he won't get aware with his ways and Revan tells them they dont even know what's coming.           
Cut to Coruscant on a gloomy day and you see a giant ship enter the atmosphere, it lands at the main landing bay as Jedi surround the ship and out of the doors Malak is revealed, behind him, the lightsabers of 100 sith ignite and they charge the temple.          
Back and forth Revan fights the Jedi and the assault on the Jedi temple goes on. The war is ignited.            
Finally, Revan kills the Jedi master, he raises his saber to kill his apprentice but momentarily pauses feeling an unease in the force, the padawan rolls away and she jumps in the ship and flys away, her name is Bastila Shan.        
               
Revan heads on his ship and flies to Coruscant, when he lands he is met by Malak who discusses his success. Finally, Vitiate's ship lands, he conjoins with Revan and Malak as the remaining Sith search the temple. Malak tells them most of his forces are dead but they managed to kill hundreds of Jedi. Many of the Jedi retreated though. Revan says there are other Jedi Temples and thousands of Jedi and that the war has just begun. Vitiate turns to them and tells them it is an excellent start to the War though, and now that the Star Forge is his, he will rule the galaxy. Revan and Malak glance at each other in unease. Vitiate then exclaims ""now for your next tasks..."" Revan and Malak glance at each other again, both igniting their lightsabers and with one unified sweep, they slay the Vitiate. The camera pans to the burning city of Cosusont as fighter pilots rain over the city. The credit then roll with an eery Sith theme.",StarWars,1577413472,theclownermb,6,1,True,2019-12-26

29,Watched Solo - Verdict : Solo = Good,"I don't know why people hate this movie. I don't even get why people call this movie mediocre or barely passable. 7.5 to 8/10 for me. 

Complaints I disagree with, or at least don't think carry much weight : 

1. Checklist of things from OT - you can remove all of this with the exception of Chewie and it wouldn't affect the quality of the movie. i.e. it doesn't have to be the Kessel run, it doesn't have to be the blaster he has in the OT, it doesn't have to be Lando or the Millenium Falcon. Only Chewy really needs to be Chewy as getting beaten up by another alien who also acts as muscle wouldn't really be replaceable. The other nostalgia bits are just a glaze applied to the movie. 

2. The movie ruins Han's character - No it doesn't. The Han here is just less jaded then the one at the beginning of A New Hope. He's still a 'rogue' who isn't really interested in giving himself over to a cause, but is incapable of stopping himself from helping people that he knows are good that need it.

3. Darkness/colors - Not sure if the Netflix rendering clears some of this up. Some of the start on the first planet was too dark, but only by a little bit. 

4. Solo getting his name from a recruiter - Where the fuck else did you want him to get it from? 

5. Weird statements that Chewie and Lando don't get enough character development. Compared to what? Chewbacca, the mulit-layered hero from the OT????

6. Darth Maul being confusing - I don't think anyone has an issue with this. Him lighting up his lightsaber was stupid though. 

What this movie did have was likeable characters and a plot that, while overly conveinent, makes sense, excellent visuals, and fantastic action scenes/sequences (with the exception of the latter portion of the Kessel run bit with the squid monster).

I'd like to see more of the crime syndicates, I'd like to see more of the resistance fighters to that crime syndicate (The Enfys Nest character/actress could carry a movie), and I think Darth Maul remains an intimidating villain.",StarWars,1577413823,strange_to_be_soup,31,1,True,2019-12-26

31,[MAJOR SPOILERS FOR RISE OF SKYWALKER] DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN.,"This is a little rant of mine. Sorry if some info is off I was kinda heated when I made this. Feel free to disagree and discuss this with each other in the comments.

Also to clarify someone told me to say what I didnt like about Leias death scene

""It was ruined because the lady explained what she was going off to do. What we call unnecessary in story narration. Plus Leia was what killed him. Rey brought him back which don't get me started on the whole using life force to heal people shit. Also they should have killed off leia in the last movie so it made it way less emotional in this movie. And also why didnt her body disappear right away? That doesnt make any sense at all. Your body disappears when you die if you are one with the force so you are telling me she wasnt one with the force tell Ben Solo was? That doesnt make ANY SENSE you cant change your position within the force once you die! In the famous words of the great late Han Solo ""that's not how the force works!"" 
All this comes back to one of the main reasons this movie sucked. It had no rules. Yes the prequels were boring as hell and didnt do justice to alot of things but at least they had a plan and rules. They weren't sloppy. They didnt do things out of convience to the plot which was done alot in this movie""",StarWars,1577414403,StokedMiner,0,1,True,2019-12-26

Sure, Palpatine has apparently been killed by the end of *Rise of Skywalker*, but he already defeated death once.

My idea would be a movie a bit like *The Social Network*, in which details of Palpatine's crimes are revealed mainly thought depositions and witnesses testifying before the judges.

The judiciary is pretty much unexplored territory in the Star Wars movies, appearing just in passing in a short conversation in *Episode 1: The Phantom Menace*.

Ok So The  Mandolorian Takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi and All the imperial credits and stuff can still be used if you go to the right places. So if Its 5 years after and Baby Yoda is 50 years old we know he was born before Luke Skywalker. (To get this straight now Baby Yoda is 50, luke is 28 at the time)  Chancellor Palpatine “dies” in Return of the Jedi 5 year earlier making Baby yoda 45 users old at the time. This could mean Palpatine knew that Baby Yoda existed and feared his force powers because Real Yoda turned out to be so strong as an adult. This Baby Yoda  could grow up and threaten his empire so He must’ve decided to put a huge bounty on his head so He could either be taken to Palpatine or killed in general. If he was taken to palpatine he could be turned to the dark side making an extremely powerful weapon. But now since Palpatine is “dead” People think that they can Take Baby Yoda and Make him their own personal warrior

After him explaining that that one had to come second we watched ANH and I lost my little mind when I saw Vader standing in the hall of the Death Star with his saber out. I was hooked from there on out. 

Now Dad jokes and calls me a nerd for still liking Star Wars as much as I do despite being almost 20. I have to remind him it’s his fault bc he bought it for me.

In 2010, my dad became one with the force after his battle with cancer. 

For me, this new trilogy brought back the excitement and childlike wonder of my youth. The feelings I’d get from these films allowed me to reflect on the privilege of 16 years of life with my dad. Even though we weren’t able to watch them together, I always felt his presence. 

Finishing TROS for a second time, a few days after Christmas, and almost a decade since his passing, brought closure, but also a closeness. This new trilogy will always be incredibly special to me for that reason. 

So, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone involved: JJ, Rian, Daisy, Adam, John, Oscar, etc. for making my feel like a child again and for giving me that magical, almost spiritual, connection to my dad again.

103,Episode 9 makes this critical piece of Lore very clear.,"In 9, we see that Palpatine created Snoke, or cloned him, or possessed him, or whatever. What is clear though is that he was not able to create a full perfect being.

Anakin was not created by Palpatine and/or Plagueis. One comic teases this, but it is a vision and meant to be spooking vader, and again, we clearly see that Palpatine could not replicate this later.

Anakin was created by the Force as a response to Palpatine and Plagueis messing with the force, in order to bring the Force back into balance. Vader killed Palpatine and also died, bringing balance back. Then Palpatine came back and now has been killed for good, and the Skywalker bloodline fully ended, and balance is certainly back now (except for a lack of dark side users now... we'll see if that goes anywhere).

My main point is to end the unusual confusion on the creation of Anakin. He was not created by Palpatine and/or Plagueis, but a response.

If there is any other explanation, let me know. But episode 9 makes it very clear that either it was the Force, or it was just Plagueis - Palpatine clearly had no intention of finding Anakin.",StarWars,1577425022,daftjedi,8,1,True,2019-12-27

105,What makes Star Wars characters good. And why Rey is the complete opposite.,"What makes a good character in star wars? Well in my opinion, i believe that a characters flaws make them feel real, and grip the audience in a better way. This is why I love Anakin as a character so much. 

Anakins flaw is that he loves Padmè and his unborn children so much. It not captures his fall from grace, but also his rise. He had to live with what he had done to all of those jedi in the temple.

This leads to why I personally don’t like Rey as a character. She’s too perfect! She has no significant flaws. She was good at everything she did, whether that be her expertise with a blaster, the force with minimal training, and her piloting skills. She may not know who she is but that doesn’t create a good character. she learns who she is but doesn’t to be that so she just does what she wants and “becomes” a skywalker. 

Lets take Obi-Wan for example. His biggest flaw is his soft part for peoples feelings. He didn’t have the heart to finish Anakin on Mustafar, and he didn’t have the heart to tell Luke that Vader was his father. He could have ended the reign of the Empire right there on mustafar. but he didn’t that failure makes Obi-Wan such a gripping character! He was made out to be this very wise character throughout the beginning of the prequels and in the Original series. But he wasn’t. He was wise, but not without his failures and misdeeds.

106,Can someone explain Palpatine’s plan (prequel trilogy)?,"Hello all,

I was watching the prequel trilogy again recently, and I began thinking: what exactly does Palpatine stand to gain by arranging the blockade and invasion of Naboo? This is before he knew of Anakin (at least in the old EU canon, according to the novel Darth Plagueis iirc), so it couldn’t have had to do with him whatsoever... 

Becoming Supreme Chancellor does not make sense to me because it seems like that can just happen in the next election, that there is no need for a vote of no confidence. His plan from Episode II onwards (which, according to the timeline, was initiated at around the time of Episode I, so even discounting turning Anakin) makes sense (although I do think it relies on a LOT of coincidences, but we can chalk that up to the will of the Force): Jedi find clones, Jedi use clones to fight in the war where he is orchestrating both sides, war is an excuse for him to gain more power in the Senate and basically become a dictator, ultimately use the clones to kill the Jedi, and the Sith win.

Besides becoming chancellor, which, as I mentioned earlier, could’ve occurred under different circumstances, this entire plan could’ve happened without anything from the Invasion of Naboo. So I ask you, fine Redditors: am I missing something or was there nothing for Palpatine to truly gain by orchestrating the events of Episode I?

I am also curious as to what Palpy did between Episodes I and II to further his grand plan, in either the old or the new canons. As far as I know, he really didn’t do much besides training Dooku and encouraging the Separatist movement, which, again, didn’t require him to be Supreme Chancellor to do. So, again, the question comes up: in the context of the Sith Grand Plan, where does the Invasion of Naboo fall? Why would Palpy do something like that when he knew it would cause Jedi to undertake the negotiations and solve the issue, therefore learning of the Sith’s existence? Is Episode I totally useless to the overarching plot of the prequels besides the discovery of Anakin and the Sith?

Is it possible that he was transferring her life to him to basically keep him in alive as a mean of life support during the surgery?

124,My new “Head Canon” ending for TROS,"SPOILERS (duh)

Alright so I’m very, really, extremely upset that JJ decided to kill Ben Solo instead of keeping him alive to explore the force with Rey. I thought it could’ve made for a super cool Disney+ series with them after TROS, assuming Daisy would be up to play Rey again (I thought I saw somewhere that she was done with Star Wars after this but I’m not sure). But, Ben just had to die and that’s really disappointing because he was easily my favorite character in the Sequels. Killing him off just felt pointless so I came up with my own ending that makes more sense TO ME. 

(You don’t have to kill me if you disagree this is personally how I think it should’ve gone)

So whenever he picks up Rey and revives her, he proceeds to “die” like he did in the movie. But, instead of fading away, it shows Leia fading away and giving up her life for his. Then he comes back to life and Rey and him kiss. Since everyone in the Resistance will only look at him as Kylo Ren he decides takes off in his Tie Fighter with Leia’s lightsaber to go hide on Ach-To. We could get a scene of him reconciling with Luke or something. Before he leaves, he hands Rey a cloaked binary beacon and tells her to go celebrate with the Resistance and that they’ll meet again soon. 

Then to end the movie, we follow Rey tracking the beacon to Tatooine, where Ben is waiting for her at Luke’s homestead. Rey brings Luke’s saber and Ben brings Leia’s and they bury them in the desert. Ben wraps his arm around Rey as they stare off into the binary sunset as Luke and Leia’s force ghosts smile in the distance.

Let me know what you think of this ending. I still liked TROS overall but I think they could’ve done a few things so much better. I don’t get why they had to kill off Ben Solo. I hated how Rey went back to AchTo and decided to just give up all of a sudden. I also hated the whole dagger thing but all in all, it really didn’t matter to me.

Then came Episode VIII and all you need to know is he fell for a pathetic attempt of a prank call and then shortly after he got force handled by Snoke. All of this was in front of his crew which immediately took General Hux from intriguing villain to someone you can't take serious anymore. 

Thus we come to Episode IX. Our poor man Hux seemed back on the verge of a decent story arc when we learn he is spying on the First Order for the Resistance. But to our dismay that was for naught as his reasoning was quickly found to be pathetic, and his demise a minute later ended his tragic tale.

147,Why Rey was overpowered in TFA and TLJ (Theory) BASED ON TROS EVENTS,"Since the release of TFA there have been countless complaints of Rey’s unjustified abilities and ridiculous powers that she had without any training at all. I, for one, used to agree with these complaints. It felt like Disney was spitting in the face of loyal fans with a “Mary Sue” character, but i think this new film resolved that in a lot of ways.

It was revealed in TRoS that Rey is Palpatine’s granddaughter, and also that Palpatine is still alive.

It’s important to remember BOTH of these things are true, because we need both in order to justify Rey’s strength in TFA.

Now it’s clear that being a descendant of Palpatine gives Rey tremendous strength and connection to the force, which justifies her ability in TRoS and the later parts of TLJ. Her ability was high because she came from a strong bloodline, and that makes sense.

What didn’t make sense (until now) was why she was so strong in TFA. Why was she able to beat Kylo Ren, a Skywalker with just as much power but more training? Why was she able to use the force in ways she’d never been taught to?

Here’s where it’s important to remember that Palpatine was still alive! One of the main powers the Force allows is influence and inspiration. Since we know now that Palpatine was pulling the strings from the start, he was clearly involved in the events of TFA from the background, and I suggest that he was subtly inspiring and directing Rey, giving her the power she needed in order to make his plan come to fruition.

So Rey wasn’t unjustifiably strong, she had the strongest influence in the galaxy giving her direction and directing her otherwise unfocused powers.

With the shenanigans at the end of TRoS and Rey getting the Skywalker moniker, it definitely seems like what Yoda saw did actually come true. Pretty cool.

188,"[spoilers] the Mandalorian, everything you need to know anout ""that thing""","The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, prior to 1019 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.

By 21 BBY, the Darksaber was in the possession of Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch and House Vizsla during the Clone Wars. He used the blade during his conflicts with the New Mandalorians, including his successful takeover of Mandalore. After the coup, Darth Maul killed Vizsla and took the Darksaber as his own, becoming the leader of Death Watch. Maul's old master, Darth Sidious, soon arrived on Mandalore to confront his former apprentice, and Maul used the Darksaber against him. Maul was bested in combat, taken prisoner and held at a Separatist prison, the Spire, on Stygeon Prime.

Maul was soon rescued from the Spire at the behest of Prime Minister Almec, whom Maul had chosen as the public leader of Mandalore. After being freed, Maul returned to Zanbar, the location of a Death Watch camp, and was given back the Darksaber, which had been recovered from the Sundari Royal Palace, the site of Maul's duel with Sidious. Shortly after his return, Zanbar was attacked by the Separatist Droid Army, led by General Grievous, and Maul made use of the Darksaber against the cyborg general. Maul continued to use the Darksaber in several subsequent battles, such as the battle on Ord Mantell, the assault on Vizsla Keep 09, and the second battle of Dathomir.

During the Age of the Empire, the Mandalorian weapons expert and rebel Sabine Wren retrieved the Darksaber from the Nightsister lair on Dathomir. At the urging of Fenn Rau and her fellow Spectres, Sabine agreed to undergo training with the Darksaber under the tutelage of Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus. Later, Sabine brought the Darksaber with her and her rebel companions during a mission to Krownest to seek her family's support for the rebellion. Sabine became the rightful wielder of the Darksaber after defeating Viceroy Gar Saxon in a duel.

After rescuing her father from Imperial custody and destroying the superweapon she had built while an Imperial cadet, Sabine gave the Darksaber over to Bo-Katan Kryze, who she deemed to be the rightful person to lead the Mandalorians against the Empire.",StarWars,1577443113,FellatiatedPiece,18,1,True,2019-12-27
189,Am I the only one who finds it unrealistic that people don't know that the Jedi existed?,"Minor Mandalorian show spoilers.

For context, I am referring characters in the Mandalorian, which is roughly only 7 years after Return Of The Jedi.

The Armourer mentions ""sorcerers"" called Jedi and how there was once a war between the Mandalorians and them (referring to The Clone Wars). Mando, Cara and Greef know nothing about them, they don't know about the force or the jedi. It really bothers me because I feel it's unrealistic.

Because apparently people have forgotten that the Jedi had a vital role in the Clone Wars, and you'd think they'd know/remember that, and even before the Clone Wars, the Jedi were closely allied with the Galactic Senate for generations and centuries. Maybe the Empire erased some records of the Jedi, but billions of people across the galaxy would still know them and their impact on the galaxy.

Also, would it not be common knowledge that a Jedi (Luke Skywalker) defeated Darth Vader at The Battle Of Endor and helped destroy both Death Stars? Would he of not been praised or mentioned to the galaxy for starting the downfall of the Empire?

On a later note, approximately 30 years after The Battle Of Endor, which is when the sequels are set, Rey doesn't know of the Jedi, which is fair with her as she has limited galaxy knowledge, but Finn doesn't know either which I don't understand as he would have more historical knowledge (you would think).

Ok, maybe. But I've found many of the people making this accusation are old school Star Wars fans like me who grew up with the old Expanded Universe after the OT. You know, those hundreds of books that took place primarily after the Battle of Endor, which told us that a significant portion of the Empire remained in power alongside the New Republic and introduced a new big bad. Those books which ressurected Palpatine a number of times (one time completely disregarding Lukes previous arc and turning him to the dark side), which introduced force nullifying reptiles, a whole new species of nasty force undetectable barbarians far worse than the Sith. I could go on.

I find it a bit odd that these people were happy with the continuing EU canon which nullified the ending of ROTJ arguably more so in some cases, yet this time round it's apparently unacceptable.",StarWars,1577445782,Blokeyman,9,1,True,2019-12-27

208,My Idea for New Star Wars Movie,"My idea for post TROS Star Wars Movies

Hi Cantina, Long time Reader, First time Poster.
I’m an aspiring Director in Australia, So far I have loved all the sequel films warts and all, I also unironicly love the prequels and can’t help but come up with my own idea for how I would make post TROS movies. First off, No Trilogy. Star Wars is probably better of using the marvel method as long as they are spaced out well. 
Anyway, My idea came to me when I realised that one of Palpatine XSD( Death Star Destroyers) had already left exegoul before the Resistance destroyed the fleet. My idea is that after the defeat of the final order all the remaining first order generals, admirals ect went all warlord just like the Imperial Remnent, but without the battle of jakku and operation cinder The Remnent Order/ Last Order( either or ) are much stronger, like in legends. The focus would be one mini empire that took over the corporate sector and used gravity wells to cut it of from the galaxy and convince everyone in it that they are the sole survivors of the final order.
The movie would follow a band of misfits trying to stop the evil leader of this mini empire and destoy those gravity well so the resistance could help them. While I love the Rebel alliance and Resistance, I would like to tell a story where even a group of like four people could change the galaxy without an army in the background.
I would also like to explore The force a bit more, specifically People learning to get the force and the idea of force sensitive droids. Just an idea. I also just want to see what Rey’s Jedi order would look like, We already know Finn will probably be her first student.

There is a lot more to it but that is the general premise, let me know if you liked it and give me any advice for my future in film, let’s hope I get to make it one day and not get booted for creative difference😂 I’m kidding. But seriously I really want to make these movies one day so let’s hope that happens, I have loads of ideas for Star Wars and a whole bunch of other stuff not relevant to Star wars so please give me any advice you want.

So the 1st Skywalker was made by the force through Palpatines manipulation, he was born to a woman whose last name was Skywalker. In reality you could say he is a Palpatine aswell, but that's besides the point. With that said depending on if Palpatines son was made through manipulation of the force wouldn't him an Anakin be related as well technically having the same father? Wouldn't that make them... brothers?! Okay. So if that's the case then they are related to a degree one calls himself a Skywalker the other (possibly) calls himself a Palpatine but regardless of what they call themself they come from the same place. So in reality Anakin was only half Skywalker, he was arguably more a Palpatine, which leads me to Luke and Leia, wouldnt that also make them Palpatines to a degree? So Rey being related to the Skywalkers could easily take on the same name because they do share the same origin after all. I really wish this was explained in the movie.

A lot of people, myself included have looked at the last three movies and have concluded that unfortunately they're not really good. However, this gave me the idea to ask the community what they would have done instead in order to make the sequel trilogy better than the three movies we have now. There's such a wide variety of different approaches that people could take with this question. Either they could use the building blocks and characters of the existing sequel trilogy and make something else with them, or go in a completely original direction with entirely new characters, settings and ideas. Or even both. 

I myself of course also have such an idea that is a mix of both, mostly using ideas from the sequel trilogy itself and adding small bits of original content. In my version,  it is ten years after the original trilogy and the Galactic Republic is rebuilding, with Luck also trying to rebuild the Jedi Order. the main protagonist would have been Finn, a Republic Agent who's job is to investigate and hunt down former members of the Empire(sort of like how people hunted down former Nazi officers after World War 2). However, when he investigates the murder-suicide of a recently appointed Jedi Master he teams up with the Jedi's Padawan, Rey as the two then uncover a conspiracy where those formally in the empire have infiltrated high positions within the Republic, too far up in political power to be challenged directly. Resulting in the two having to work outside the law in order to bring them down, knowing that this would cause them to be branded as criminals. But, that's just my version and obviously many people have their own interpretation. So please, let me know what you would have done.",StarWars,1577452124,TRedRandom,17,1,True,2019-12-27

The 'Chosen One' was foretold to bring balance to the Force, and as far as I know it's generally accepted that Anakin Skywalker is the 'Chosen One'.

But would you say he brings 'balance' to the Force by leading the massacre of the Jedi during *Revenge of the Sith* by reducing the number of light-side users, or does he bring balance by destroying Palpatine and abandoning the Sith at the end of *Return of the Jedi*.

I'm leaning towards balance being achieved in Episode III because the Sith are 'restored' alongside the Jedi, where as after *Return of the Jedi* the Sith are destroyed, presumably entirely.

Both lead a separatist/successionist faction

Both are respected military leaders/warriors

Both are wealthy

Both are cast out of the establishment (Jedi Order-US Military)

Both are old white dudes with beards

There are probably more similarities that y'all can think of.

249,"What is the Sith’s political agenda, aside from destroying the Jedi?","I have a few questions about the political ideology of the Sith. It’s a given that they wanted to overthrow the Jedi, and I understand some of the lore behind their conflict which stretches across millennia.

But some things don’t make sense to me:

1. What do the Sith envision for the empire when the Jedi are eradicated and they finally have absolute control? Do they want to patch up the economy, fix starvation, prevent conflict from breaking out between planets or what?
2. Why are the Sith interested in helping the empire anyways? I thought their entire worldview was based around conflict and dominance. When Anakin says he’s brought “peace, freedom, justice and security” to the empire, these seem like weirdly altruistic goals for a Sith.
3. Specifically, why do they want “peace”? I thought the Sith taught “peace is a lie; there is only passion”. Wouldn’t they want an anarchical galaxy where everyone is constantly fighting to be the top dog?
4. At what point do the Sith sit back and smile, saying “great: we’ve done it. Our work is finished now” - or do they?

253,"Star Wars game with Fallen Order's gameplay, and Knights of the old Republic Story and RPG Elements.","I understand gaming isnt the biggest thing on this subreddit, so I have no idea how this will be received,  but I wanted to share.

I love Star Wars, and Jedi: Fallen Order is an absolutely amazing Star Wars game, it's fun, and enjoyable, lots to explore and find and the story is really enjoyable.

But while I loved the story I couldn't help but remember old Star Wars games, specifically, KOTOR. A game I loved a lot, and while Jedi: Fallen Order is not the same, I kinda thought ""what if we mixed the best of both worlds"".

IF there is ever a sequal to Fallen Order (which there will probs be since EA), why not play with the RPG and world? Gameplay can stay the same cuz its fucking amazing, But let us do something like pick Republic or Empire, and a more detailed skill tree with more force abilities, lightsaber abilities and so on. Let us fully choose for our character, and fully embrace the dark side or not, maybe allow character creation so I can be a Twi'lek or Chiss. Idk I just want a proper Star Wars RPG with an amazing combat and exploration system.

255,Why The Last Jedi was GOOD!!,"The last Jedi is exactly what this trilogy needed. Here’s why. 

The Force Awakens was a carbon copy of ANH and we all see this. It was obviously intentional, as it was nostalgic and also very compelling for new fans. 

Fast forward to The Last Jedi, it definitely feels similar movie to empire. The rebels are on the run, being chased by the bad guys to remote planet, there is a standoff with trenches and a big hanger in a big open setting where all of the important characters are present. But the ending is what makes this movie different, and GOOD in its own way. The lightsaber duel between Luke’s projection and Kylo is both unique and VERY symbolic!! So so many people skip over this duel because it wasn’t long or flashy or “cool”. This duel was purely meant to be symbolic. It was Kylo battling himself. It was Kylo officially going to a point of no return. If you thought this duel was weak and had little meaning, I encourage you to watch it again and pay attention. Every single swing of the blade by Kylo has so much force and meaning behind it. In my eyes, this duel shows that Kylo is truly gone. He swings his blade with so much hate and intent to kill Luke Skywalker it’s almost terrifying. This duel was not only a defeat for Kylo, but a HUGE blow on his heart and soul and moral. 

Moving on, the ending of The Last Jedi set us up for a completely unpredictable Saga Finale. It’s not like the past few movies where we could kinda predict what was going to happen, because they followed the same blueprint as the OT. This final movie truly feels like
It’s going to be a surprise, and a perfect ending to an amazing saga.

256,Prequels do everything worse than sequels,"I see this a lot in response to the sequel trilogy, as people stretch credibility to explain why the prequels are so much better than the Disney movies, which ruined Star Wars. In fact, they  frequently criticize the sequels for doing things the prequels did to a far greater degree. I find it interesting. I thought I'd give my 2 cents on the matter(sorry, it's one of 'those' posts). 

It just seems as if sequel haters are projecting the flaws of the prequels onto the sequels. If you criticize the sequels for these, I hope you realize that they were all present much sooner in the prequels

To be clear, my intention is not to insult you if you like the prequels. You are welcome to dismiss this little post, or you can actually reevaluate your opinions of the sequels in comparison to the prequels. I don't matter. Our opinions over pulp characters and spaceships don't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

Common criticisms of the sequel trilogy include...

\-stupid humor

\-ruins classic characters

\-doesn't do anything new/just copies original movies

\-they are pointless

\-it contradicts the rules of Star Wars

\-lack of coherent plan tying all films together

\-lack of context

\-they're just in it for the money

&amp;#x200B;

I will attempt to address each of these.

Stupid humor: There is nowhere near the awkward attempt at slapstick humor in the recent ones. The prequels constantly had CGI characters in the background doing stupid childish things for humor. Think RD-D2's slapstick confrontation with the droids in Ep3, Jar Jar stepping in feces, etc. The humor in the sequels were more clever in that they subvert typical genre tropes(Kylo Ren having a tantrum and the troopers walking away in fear was nice because we got to see another side of the henchman cowering in fear and bad boss tropes/the clothes ironing machine disguised as a spaceship). They usually involved a  punchline, thus making them automatically more quippy. 

\-Ruin classic characters: the prequels ruined the backstory of these iconic characters. Darth Vader, the baddest mother fucker went from great jedi Knight corrupted by the power of the dark side to creepy alt right fascist kid with a fetish for mass murdering children(happens in ep2 and ep3, that's just a crazy idea). C3P0 was coincidentally his creation? awkward connections. Leia mentions her memories of her mother in ep6, but Padmé dies in childbirth, so that doesn't make sense.  Yoda is no longer a really wise jedi master. He is completely impotent and unable to detect the presence of Palpatine who is literally directly under his nose, and instead of wisdom, he's a tiny little ninja. What happened to ""Luminous beings are we""

\-doesn't do anything new: Even Force Awakens, a supposed rehash, does interesting things with classic tropes. Kylo Ren/Ben, instead of being a heroic character struggling to overcome the dark side, is tempted by the light side, and trying to overcome his good qualities. Other trope characters are experimented with in interesting ways. We see what happens to the devil may care, rogue archetype character with Han Solo. He never truly grows past that. That sort of attitude is not conductive to personal growth, as like everyone, Han Solo gets old. Stormtroopers can also be horrified by death and suffering, as seen with Finn. Last Jedi is a whole movie built on experimenting with tropes and showing a different side to things. Even with Canto Bight, we are presented with a new side of the galactic conflict(but the message is heavy handed). War is an economy the galaxy has become dependent on. And so forth. Luke is one of my favorites. What happens to the great hero, after he saves the day? Probably Mark Hamill's best performance in film. Frankly, the prequel movies aren't exactly that innovative. They are plagued by this obsession to constantly callback to previous movies in weird retcons and unnecessary explanations. Darth Vader became so popular that he was made into the chosen one? In the original film, he takes orders from a non-force user(Tarkin orders him to stop strangling an arrogant official dismissive of the force). He was just a jedi who betrayed the order. Vader was not that interesting a character; he was an icon with a character arc only in his 3rd film. He just was never complex enough for all that. Did we really  need an origin story for C3P0? And did every single character have to be connected in such contrived ways? Don't tell me it was the Force binding everyone together, because that just makes the galaxy seem small. Why did we have to revisit Tatooine for such lengthy segments in ALL 3 films. Why would they hide Luke and Leia on Vader's home planet? What's up with Boba Fett's weird origin story of being a clone of the guy who they made a clone army out of? Why does Lucas have such a fixation on children version of classic characters(Anakin, Greedo, Boba?). Hell, why do all the Sith use red lightsabers in the prequels? That was a Darth Vader thing, which made sense because he was a former Jedi. Palpatine looked at the lightsaber of Luke with condescension(""ah yes, a lightsaber... a JEDI's weapon""). He didn't need a lightsaber to destroy Luke, thanks to the lightning. And why do they all have Darth in their name now? It cheapens Vader's icon status. Oh, and now Dooku also has lightning. Why does Palpatine not have any other tricks besides lightning? At least we see new force powers in Last Jedi and even Force Awakens(with Kylo holding a blaster laser in the air with his mind). 

\-they are pointless: the prequels can be seen as pointless. We know everything we need to know for the story of the originals from the opening crawl, and the movies themselves. But the prequels need to give backstories to EVERYTHING, even if it is a weird ret-con. ""You fought in the Clone wars"" was a cool tease of past events that let our own imaginations run wild. We did not need an explanation, especially not one so dumb. Just a conspiracy to get clones of the guy boba Fett was cloned from? Ok then. The originals tell a complete story, that ties up all loose ends, and we didn't need prequels. 

\-contradicts the rules of Star Wars: every Star Wars movie that does new things contradicts the rules of Star Wars. Remember when Luke used the force to lift his lightsaber from the ice in ep5? Since when could Jedi use the force to lift stuff? Since when did they have force push in ep1? Why the hell can they force speed run like the flash in ep1(which they never show again because it was stupid). It's fantasy , so they can do whatever they want. If it works well in the context of the story, that's enough justification. Snoke linking Rey and Kylo was a great new force power, because it demonstrated his vast power and it also linked the 2 most important characters of the new saga closer together.

\-Lack of coherent plan linking them all together: This is very interesting to me personally. None of the trilogies were perfectly laid out with clear plans on how to lay them together. ""Lucas had a vision"". Well, if he did, it was unclear and full of strange retcons. Luke, Vader and Leia were clearly not intended to all be related until ep6. Vader being his father was a cool shocking twist in ep5, but there are no references to that previous to that film. Leia being his sister is really uncomfortable because of the mild incest in ep4 and 5 and love triangle with Han. As for the prequels, it was clear that the overarching plan for those was built on a weak foundation. Ep1 and 2 don't really do much to advance the grand plan. Ep 2 is the beginning of a war, and then ep3 starts when the war has been going on for years and we get to see the end of it. So we only see the start and end of the Clone Wars. In a single film, Lucas has to fit in the end of the clone wars, end of republic, corruption of Anakin, tragedy of Anakin and Obi-Wan, tragedy of Padmé and Anakin, birth of Luke and Leia, the return of the Sith, the death of Count Dooku, death of Grievous, etc. No wonder it all feels rushed, even when it is boring. And each new prequel introduces a new main villain serving under the future Emperor. E1 has Maul, 2 has Dooku, 3 has Grievous. And people still tell me it was all really well planned out. At least the sequel trilogy consistently had Kylo Ren.

\-Lack of context: ok, this is the opposite problem for the prequels, as they explain way too much. All it is is exposition. Obi Wan tells us that he is proud of Anakin, rather than that being clear from the film itself. If a script has to have its own characters tell you how the characters feel, it kind of sucks. I don 't need to know the galactic politics in a fantasy space opera. That's a lot of boring exposition, and it is obvious even Lucas was not that interested in it. In Ep1, we do not even get to see the vote of no confidence. it is shown off screen. When the movie takes so much screentime devoted to talking about its politics, but then doesn't even depict the decisive moments of its universe's politics, that kind of fails on both levels. it fails to give a riveting political narrative, and it fails to give an effective action narrative because so much time was spent away form the cool things. the sequels get to the point. The opening crawl give us what we need to know. First Order are remnants of empire. Resistance are funded by republic to fight them. Leia leads them. Boom! That's it, all out of the way! As for Snoke, we don'T need a complex backstory for every villain. Often , leaving us to imagine their backstory can be more interesting. The Emperor never got any complex backstory in the originals. Evil guy, force powers, hates jedi, has no lightsaber. Boom! That's all we need to know. Besides, Snoke unexpectedly dies, and with so much already happening in the plot, I don't think we need to waste precious minutes on unnecessary backstory. Do you guys wanna see how Snoke was a slaveboy, abused , who used the dark side of the force to get out of his traumatic upbringing? No thank you. Thank god we didn't get something as stupid as Boba fett is a clone, and all his clone brethren were the clones of the clone wars

\-they're just in it for the money: Yep, so were the prequels. Lucas had a story to tell. So did JJ. And so did Johnson. You might not like that story, which is fine (it's just a movie about space wizards and cowboys, we don't need to worry about it).

\-I'm sure there are other things, but I believe my argument is far too long as is. Please share your thoughts(if you care enough, otherwise, have a nice day!)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh! By the way, regarding the 2 ""A Star Wars Story"" anthology films, I think they are wholeheartedly mediocre, maybe kind of bad. They are just there to give any possible backstory to anything. Their protagonists tend to be boring(they made Han Solo a bland character, so that's impressive I guess). Rogue One exists to explain a plot hole that never existed. The Death Star needs an exhaust port to release all that energy. End of story. No need for this elaborate stupid plan. They really do just depend on the context of the classic movies to have any worth. But some of the action is fun, so there is that.",StarWars,1574823268,Dont_Hurt_Me_Mommy,0,1,True,2019-11-26

264,"Whatever happens in The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine's return must be explained satisfyingly","The reason I say this is before the trailer dropped, we all thought Palpatine was dead and gone, and Kylo would be the main antagonist. He hasn't been mentioned in any living capacity in the sequels thus far(Luke was referencing the past in TLJ), and it was a huge shock to hear his familiar cackle, also the appearance of Ian McDiarmid at Celebration. Since it came out of left field, we need a solid explanation to why Palpatine is back, how he survived being thrown by Vader, the explosion of Death Star II, and how he's sustained himself after all these years and hidden himself away from Luke Skywalker/Leia/Rey/Kylo. 

With Snoke, you can at least accept the fact that he's just a ""guy"" who's super powerful and just appeared one day to rule the First Order because they needed a new villain and it was a reboot, but if we got that with Palpatine in the form of nothing or a throwaway line, it'd feel hollow and unearned(my hatred kept my corporeal form intact, etc) and it would lower the stakes and meaning of Anakin's sacrifice if the Force essentially keeps the bad guys immortal(worked with Maul once, any more and that's cheap) There might even be a huge retcon and Palpatine in ROTJ was a clone while TROS Palps is the real thing(please no)

I'd be okay with him being a Sith spirit who is lain dormant and then is revived by the continual power imbalance in the Force. He's very weak and needs a large amount of Force energy to manifest, that way his ROTJ death is still valid and Anakin achieved 30 years of peace, but Rey and Kylo are related to him in the sense that they need to banish him spiritually. Also, there needs to be a satisfying death for Sheev, one that ensures he's gone for good this time.

I don't know how JJ's gonna end this, but Sheev Palpatine is one of the top-tier Big Bads, and he deserves a good, satisfying explanation as to why he's back to grace our silver screens.",StarWars,1574824617,grilledstarfish,36,1,True,2019-11-26

272,A secret revealed? The Last Jedi theory,"Ok, so watching The Last Jedi. About 18 minutes in, Snoke is talking to Kylo Ren and demands he takes off his helmet. Doing so reveals a scar on Kylo's face, from his battle with Rey, I believe, from the end of the prior film.  If you look carefully at the scar, it is healed-over using what looks like carbon fiber.
  
In the prior films, Darth Vader was very much a barely living organic body in a mechanical shell. It wasn't until he lost most of his human form that he became truly powerful.
  
Even Luke Skywalker shares the same. It isn't until he loses his hand (and it is replaced with a robotic hand) that he becomes a powerful Jedi warrior.  
  
It seems that replacing organic tissue with robotic/non-living matter seems to solidify the fortitude of the character.  
  
But what about the big bad Snoke?  He is severely disfigured. Scars which go deep into the bone. And yet, he refuses to have the wounds healed with carbon fiber.  he remains, always, his moral flesh.  
  
We see this too, with Darth Sidious, and how he is severely disfigured. And yet, he never chose to be healed like Darth Vader or Kylo Ren.  
  
There is one important aspect of this to consider: Loyalty. In the end, Kylo Ren and Darth Vader become ""turned"" when they meet their end scene.  Having given in to The Force. Yet, The Emperor as well as Snoke, never ""give in"".
  
It might imply the power of technology to corrupt a persons essence of who they are, and the reticence of anyone unwilling to change who does not want to have their essence corrupted. Just as Yoda and Obi-Wan remain relatively pure, by refusing to fight unless necessary, or use technology, so does The Emperor as well as Snoke.  The Last Jedi also reinforces this by seeing Luke Skywalker live a hermitage life devoid of nearly any technology.  
  
In the end, the message is: Good, bad, doesn't matter, they are a balanced force. But adopting technology into the self leads to chaos and death and struggle.",StarWars,1574825894,you_are_all_monsters,7,1,True,2019-11-26

With this being said, the only real “complaint” (and I say that with very loose quotes) is the short runtime per episode. 

Yes, the budget was high to produce the first season, but given its abundant success, do you think Lucasfilm may take heed to fan suggestions and increase runtime duration in the following seasons? Higher budget to do so, yes, but it will garner more fandom and support for the show and franchise going forward which, in turn, yields a greater return on investment...

284,I finally did it! Every movie!,"Over the past week and a half, I finally watched every single movie for the first time! I hadn’t had a chance until Disney+ came out, so I figured it’d give the Original trilogy a chance... which lead to the prequels... and the rest!

As someone with zero nostalgia for the series going into it, I thought I might share my thoughts about everything  :)

OT: Iconic to say the least, filled with memorable quotes and an amazing score (which I find myself humming quite a lot now haha)! I did already know the big twist, mostly due to time and pop culture references, but it was nice to get some context! However, some of the cringy acting and special effects (while understandable) pulled me out of the story a few times.  9/10

PT: Another amazing score, and updated special effects! Woot woot! I will admit that again, certain cringy dialogue **cough cough** “Sand” **cough cough** pulled me out of the story again, but overall I surprisingly enjoyed them! I’m a huge fan of betrayal in movies, and I do enjoy an excellent villain, so seeing Anakin’s turn and Palpatine’s manipulation was awesome to me! (Also Qui-gon is best Jedi) my favorite trilogy! 10/10

RO: Decent movie, but even though I watched it recently, I can’t remember much of the first half. However, I really enjoyed the Scarif act, as the rebel fights felt like a real war movie; it drew me it and I was surprised by the ending! 7/10

SOLO: Another decent movie! It was definitely interesting to see how such iconic characters met, plus I love L3 and Qi’ra! One thing I will say is that the ending wasn’t exactly a surprise, but I did find it enjoyable non the less. 7/10

TFA/TLJ: Oooof.... an attempt was made? My least favourites so far... I adore the updated cgi, as it really feels like a tangible universe when all the ships and scenery blend nicely. I also enjoy the force connection between Ben and Rey, it’s a unique way to freshen up both characters good vs. evil storylines. HOWEVER, wtf did they do to Luke? I know he toyed with the dark side in the OT, and losing Ben must’ve taken a toll; but his cynicism and isolationist behaviour just seems sooooo out of character. I hope they can try and salvage the new release next month! 6/10

Over the last four years it's seemed as if the number of Star Wars podcasts has exploded exponentially and there's no way I  could ever check out every one, but I know once TROS comes out I'm going to want to listen to pretty much nothing but Star Wars podcasts talking about TROS and the ST as a whole, and the Saga as a whole, so I'm hoping to get some good personal recommendations.

The main general Star Wars shows I've stuck with over the years are ***Full of Sith*** and ***Blue Harvest***, and I've also picked up ***Who Talks First*** along the way, although they're very inconsistent with their schedule. I also listen to ***Steele Wars*** quite a bit (although as a Kiwi I feel a little dirty every time I listen to that cheeky Aussie). I was a pretty regular listener to ***Rebel Force Radio*** for a couple of years - especially their ""Oxygen"" episodes, about John Williams' scores, and also ***Now, This Is Podcasting***, although I had to drop that last one when I decided to go spoiler free for Episode IX.

In terms of more specialized shows I really like what I've heard of ***Jaig Eyes and Jedis***, a very fun Clone Wars and Rebels rewatch podcast, and also ***Mandalorian Parsec Passion*** which is by the same guys who made the best Game of Thrones podcast, The Joffrey of Podcasts.

To be clear, I'm not affiliated with any of these particular shows, I'm just a fan of them. There are plenty of other Star Wars podcasts I've listened to and enjoyed, but ... you know ... there are only so many podcast-listening hours in a day, so a moisture farmer has to pick and choose.",StarWars,1574844900,FistsOfBucho,8,1,True,2019-11-27
309,Unpopular Opinion: Inhibitor chips are terrible lore.,"In my opinion. I think that the Inhibitor chips that have been confirmed as canon by Disney is very weak story telling.

If you've ever played Star Wars Battlefield 2. (Not the EA SWBF2.) You'll have listened to [the 501st journals.](https://youtu.be/iWOq1Tg-Jdw) The journals are the type of story telling I expect from Star Wars. Dark, gritty, realistic.

Soldiers in real life do not need inhibitor chips to bomb villages, and cops do not need them to murder citizens. 

Inhibitor chips are a childish way to hide true human attributes, and were only implimented to to suppress the distress from children from realising that their favourite characters from TCW TV show are in fact cold hard killer's.

312,The Geonosians could have fought the First Order,"There could be a whole additional series of lore surrounding the major battles fought between the First Order and a reinvigorated Separatist alliance. 

Here me out:

In Rebels, it was understood by the Empire that the entire population of Geonosis had gone ""extinct"". But there was a single Geonosian with a queen egg who could have repopulated. The Geonosians would have gone completely unnoticed by the First Order until they acted out.

A secret alliance could have been made between the Geonosians and a supplier of resources to construct a new Droid army. This time the army would be stronger because the droids would be programmed only for combat (and not other have processing power consumbed by additional mundane tasks). 

The First Order is very... OP. So the battles could have been short, or they could have lasted for years and maybe could be going on at the same time as the sequels. 

Also bear in mind, in AotC is it alluded that the Geonosians invented the Death Star. Therefore, they could potentially become as powerful as the First Order.

316,New star wars game idea,"After playing Star wars Jedi: Fallen order, I got an idea for a new star wars game. This game will take place before order 66. You star off as a youngling on your home world and then a Jedi comes and tells your parents that you are force sensitive. You are given up and are taken to the Jedi temple. You go through training and you get to go to Illum to find your Kyber crystal. After that you can fully customize your saber if you want single double or duel saber, the color of it and the hilt too. After you get your saber, you go through missions with your master. Like Red Dead Redemption 2 your actions will decide what happens. If you cause too much trouble, you will get kicked out of the order and become a sith. But if you stay good you will rank up and eventually become a master you will even train your own Padawan. Then order 66 happens your fight of clones trying to save your Padawan and if you survive you will go into hiding.

317,Unpopular Opinion: I would love to see the original trilogy remade.,"I first off want to apologise, as I'm not sure if this is the right place for this discussion, please direct me to the right place if I am in the wrong. 

I want to start with saying, I adore all of the star wars movies (besides Disney's dumpster fire). I just would love to see the Empire fight the rebellion in a more updated light. Especially after watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to2SMng4u1k. 

The original duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi just resembled fencing, with no real footwork and lightsaber combat nuances to it. I want to clarify again, I am in no way trying to take anything away from Alec Guinness or David Prowse. They were both amazing and set the stage for the performances to come. 

I just really want to see the Empire fight the rebellion with all the enhancements we've had to the movie-making process, and I suppose to a degree CGI.

I just feel like the video posted above highlights what could be now, considering it was made by a YouTube creator, on what I can only assume is a rather small budget. At least much smaller than a motion picture as big as Star Wars would be.

Again this is just my opinion, and I would like to hear everyone's thoughts on it.

While watching phantom menace in one scene Qui-Gon Jinn tells Anakins mother that he is special and that he can see things before they happen because hes a Jedi. So I was thinking if Jedis can see whats going to happen why do they die. Is it because they cant literally see whats going to happen?

331,The Clone Wars makes me extremely sad.,"I am not one to always bash on the prequels, in fact, I grew up on them. However, as I aged I started thinking more realistically toward the fact that yes, the prequels are *far* from ""good"" (RotS is the closest we get to good here).

However, I just finished grinding through the Clone Wars series, and found that it made me incredibly sad, and not because Season 1 was *horrible,* but because the rest of the series is *so* goddamn good. 

Watching Season 2 forward, I felt like I was watching Star Wars *way* more than I felt like I was during the prequels. The tone fits the entire saga, it's a war story, it holds up to what we knew prior to the prequels. 

Obi Wan describing Anakin as a ""good friend"", ""a cunning warrior"", and the ""Best star pilot in the galaxy"" made Anakin sound interesting... Then we got the prequels and I am pretty sure everyone was disappointed. Nothing Obi Wan said seemed to correlate to who we got... 

However, The Clone Wars, *that* is Anakin. *That* is the Anakin that Obi Wan described. I can fully buy the idea that Anakin Skywalker in TCW was most-definitely Luke Skywalker's father, which prior to the show, I could not.

I found that TCW made Anakin one of the most likable characters in Star Wars as a whole. The show made me feel sad for him, I didn't want to press forward and watch Anakin turn to the dark side in RotS after finishing the show. It sort of scared me, because I grew to love this character, who prior to watching the TV show, I hated. As a series, I believe that it completely enhanced Episode III and made it a *much* better film. I didn't have disdain for Hayden Christensen's portrayal as Anakin anymore (at least in Episode III. II is still really bad). 

The show made watching Episode III a heart-wrenching experience, and all I felt after finishing it was sadness. 

It made me wish we got to see more of TCW style Anakin in live action, and that the prequels were all up to the standard that TV series had set.",StarWars,1574864257,GaiWasabii,12,1,True,2019-11-27

1. There was a male and female protagonist, the female was always the Jedi.

2. Han was always gonna die in episode 7.

3. Luke was always going to be an exile after failing a student.

4. Luke was actually going to be murdered by the Jedi Killer(early Kylo prototype), instead of dying on his own terms.

5. OG Kylo was going to be trained by a woman who was basically a female Darth Maul instead of a more powerful figure like Snoke.

6. The movies were going to focus HEAVILY on Midichlorians, in fact the whole trilogy would have revolves around something about them. Lucas has even flat out said he knew fans would hate that but was gonna do it anyway. Also apparently he was going to have the Midichlorians control what Force users do morally. Yup.

7. Apparently the Millinium Falcon was gonna swim in them.

8. The Death Star ruins were always going to be revisited, except they were underwater in the OG Sequels.

366,[Theory] What if Yoda was too violent for his planet.,"https://youtu.be/YcVczlrEYTc

So just saw this video. It mentions how peaceful Yoda's species is, how they tend to be deawn to the Light side, and why Yoda and other Jedi of his species are very protective of their planet to the point of secrecy even to the Council. So what if Yoda and the others are considered the violent/savage ones relative to the rest of their planet?

I'm not very familiar with EU canon so forgive me if I miss anything.

Based on their physiology, Yoda's species(YS) could've evolved from carnivorous creatures, probably a predator, or they could have been a very violent race. Since they seem to be able to channel the force more easily than the rest of the galaxy, they were very dangerous.

And after some sort of planetary civil war, near-extinction event, or maybe even a Nazi like interplanetary movement from a YS Sith Hitler, they changed their ways. To a point when violence/violent thought was almost non-existent in their planet. So much so that they can't really feel aggression at all, like very good or naive children.

The very few who had even the tiniest bit of violent tendencies become outcast. Sort of like their version of psychopaths. In their view, these people are savages, but to us they're just similar to how Yoda acts. Their 'worst' is not even our 'bad'.

This brings us to why Yoda and other YS Jedi are very protective. They can see moral gray areas when compared to us, but they are basically the worst of the worst to others of their species. YS Jedi know what would happen if evil returns to their planet. Imagine an entire species of Sith Lords but more powerful!

368,Anyone else upset that #CloneWarsSaved BUT we only get 12 episodes? #TCWSeason8,"I'm not going to lie, I really love TCW and I'm stoked for the new season; it's always been my favorite animated show and season 7 animation looks gorgeous. I've watched and read all clone wars legacy canon content, but I gotta say I'm highly disappointed with the arcs we are getting. Based on Bad Batch being 4 episodes and the 4 episode trend in the past, it seems like we are only getting 3 final arcs which are stories we already knew about. 


Siege of Mandalore is going to be fantastic, as it should, being that it is the series finale. However, I'm not very excited for Bad Batch and Ahsokas arc. I mean, her arc is very important for canon but if we only get 12 episodes why does 33% of the season have to be the least interesting storyline in TCW legacy canon content? Bad Batch DOES look fantastic, but again, if we only get 12 episodes why is 4 of them about bringing back a cyborg member of Domino squad? I wouldnt be upset if we were getting the Kashyyyk arc that also uses Echo and Bad Batch, as it would give some closure to those characters. But bringing in Bad Batch essentially revives Domino Squad through cyborg Echo and itll be left on a cliff hanger (UNLESS they changed the plot from the original reels). Fives' death felt like a perfect ending for Domino Squad as they find the most evil plant against the republic/clones and it dies with them (and Rex). I'm ok with Echo returning but not if it leaves a cliff hanger.

Point is, we could've had 8 episodes of Dark Diciple (was really looking forward to this), 4 episodes of Crisis on Utapau (important moody Anakin development), 4 episodes of Darth Maul (some of the best imo if you read son of dathomir) and the 12 episodes we are getting. This does not include the un animated draft stories that sounded great, such as the Cad Bane/Boba arc where he gets his armor, Rex and R2 arc, a Yuuzhan Vong episode, the Padme Mon Cala political arc, the Jedi Temple/Sith Temple episodes, and the Kashyyyk arc feat. Yoda that wouldve finished the Bad Batch character arcs. 


TL;DR I apologize if this sounds like complaining or a ""FU Disney"" speech, it is not. I'm hoping there are other dedicated TCW fans out there that are also excited for Season 7 but would also like to have some of the other stories that were teased to us after the cancellation. What do I really want? I want to rise up with other fans and ask for more. Disney told us this is the final season and we all said ""OK"" instead of, ""But it should really be two more!"". If they decide to give us a 24 episode Season 7 and 8 like originally drafted, life would be complete. If you agree let's rise up and spread the word.

387,Inconsistencies with Mandalore history?,"So, I'm rewatching the third episode of The Mandalorian for what feels like the 20th time now, because y'know... it's so goddamn good why wouldn't I? Anyway, as I've been watching I've been stringing their history back through time together and came across a really odd inconsistency I'm hoping someone can help me unravel.

The canon states that towards the end of the Clone Wars, Mandalore was a pacifist world. We know this for a fact - It's one of the primary plot points surrounding Obi-Wan in the ""last"" season. At that time, the true ideology of the Mandalorian people, that of their warrior religion, strongest survive mentality, was something they were trying to bury and move away from. In that same vein, they were trying to say that those that still followed that path were now terrorists to the world (ie Death Watch).

But, if this was the case and the last thing we see of Mandalore is their commitment to pacifism, where did all these Mandalorians come from in Disney+'s new show? The time line puts The Mandalorian being found in his early childhood, roughly 6-8 years old by the looks of him in his flashbacks. If the Clone Wars were still raging at that time, given it was a 3-year war, that would make the Mandalorian himself roughly in his mid 30's at the time of the show. More likely closer to 40, perhaps. Barely younger than Boba. Does this mean that the Mandalorian people reneged on their commitment to pacifism during the Galactic Civil War, or is the Mandalorian a product of a clan that refused to abide by their world's anti-fighting beliefs? Or is there a key element discussed in, say, Rebels (which I refused to watch because it looks awful, imo) that I'm missing?

390,"My biggest problem is the new trilogy isn’t Rey, it’s the story and world surrounding her.","I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. I know the biggest argument with these movies is “Rey is too powerful.” or “Rey is a Mary-Sue.” And while I agree that it can be easily perceived that way, I’ve started to think about how it’s less to do with her being powerful but that the other story elements and world around her does little to nothing to compliment the reasoning as to why. 

Force Awakens is almost, beat for beat, retelling of  A New Hope — this is the biggest problem. We have an evil organization that mirrors the Empire in strength and appearance fighting a small group of underdog resistance fighters that mirror the Rebels in a galaxy where Jedi and the Force are still only things of legend and myth. We’re being brought into a story where the world we’re shown hasn’t changed in almost any way from the previous story. By taking a story that mirrors it’s predecessor, having a character that doesn’t mirror the struggles and lack of strength in the force that Luke has in ANH can be easily seen as overpowered. 

TLJ does the same thing, it mirrors ESB by having the First Order perusing a weakened Resistance while our main character goes to train with an old Jedi Master that is hesitant to train her. She leaves during her training to help her friends and confront the main villain. We can also argue that Rey doesn’t face nearly as much failure as Luke did at the end, but this story isn’t focused on Luke. 

TROS may change a lot of this. But we won’t fully know until the end.

What if Mando was saved by Yoda himself? Bear with me... his flashbacks seems to be from a conflict during the Clone Wars. This timeline matches that period as well, as the show happens 5 years after ROTJ. 

Assuming Mando is in his late 30s, this means Yoda could have saved him from that droid on the verge of shooting Mando dead, sometime between Attack of the Clones and ROTS. 

The reason why we dont hear about this from Yoda's part is because for him, this was a common thing to happen during a conflict, but for Mando, Yoda's face stuck with him his whole life, and he never had a chance to even thank Yoda or understand what he was... until he sees baby Yoda for the first time.

412,Two Questions I Can't Seem To Understand.,"I've had these two questions in my mind for quite some time. Hopefully I'll be able to get some answers here!  


1. When Anakin fell to the Dark Side and was talking with his wife about the ""Jedi revolt"", he had mentioned to her that he had hoped Obi Wan swore loyalty to Palpatine, or something along those lines. Do you think if Obi Wan \*did\* end up swearing allegiance to Palpatine, that Palpatine would have allowed it? Or do you think he would have had him killed regardless?  

2. As we all know, Palpatine heavily manipulated Anakin/Vader and constantly tortured him physically and mentally throughout his time as his master. He'd send him on missions constantly to test his loyalty, to see if he could survive and even just for the heck of it. Not to mention trying to have him replaced for a less ""damaged"" apprentice many times. Was he treated this way for his failure and defeat to Obi Wan? And if so, do you think he still would have treated him the same way even if Vader never lost his arms and legs and ended up killing his former master on Mustafar? To me, it feels like he was doing all of this to punish Vader for his failure, so I've always wondered if he would have treated him better if he hadn't failed his duel.",StarWars,1572228587,RedDeadBoah,18,35,True,2019-10-27

I like world-building... when it actually serves a purpose in the grander story, not when it is only meant as page-filler. 

Take Star Wars: Ships of the Galaxy for example. Apparently, it claims that the Tantive IV was destroyed after it was captured by the empire. What purpose does this information actually serve? Now we have people debating whether or not that ship should/could appear in the new film (judging from a similar-looking ship in the trailer) just because of that little footnote.",StarWars,1572235841,Bulk101,25,0,True,2019-10-28

434,The SW franchise and it's fans need to realign,"I'm aware of the downvotes I'm probably going to get, but here it goes:

Guys, something is better than nothing.*

- Yes there will be corny lines
- Yes there will be plot holes
- Yes there will be a direction in the storyline that disagrees with where you think the SW galaxy is going. 

But you shouldn't expect it any other way.  I had a tough time with the prequels. I couldn't stand them. And I was the first in my town to get tickets, waiting 14.5 hours for Ep I.  Then when they told me all the stories I had read - Heir to the Empire, Jedi Academy,  Legacy of the Force, etc - weren't canon?!! So I understand feeling disappointment. 

BUT, after having to deal with a long break between Ep III &amp; VII, I came to terms with my disappointment and decided: I'm going to look the parts I like, and disregard the rest. If rather have those good parts, than nothing at all (especially if someone else enjoys what I don't). 

I didn't see Solo in theaters and being part of the problem is a regret. Granted it was just because I couldn't find the time, but I'll never not make the time again. I actually really liked Solo. Was it perfect? No. But at least Han shot first (plus there were some really great scenes). 

I'm worried that our demand for perfection - which is different for all of us - will result in Disney saying ""fuck it"" and eventually not making any more content. It's a boy overdramatic, sure, but there is a possibility. 

We need to agree with the studios that while we won't accept crap we'll find the good parts of the movies they make and not mention the parts we don't.  Otherwise, a low opening night have implications that we'll all regret.

439,My take on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker!,"Here is my take on the perfect ending for the Skywalker Saga. A while ago I came up with **my version of the story for Episode IX** and decided to post it. I'm curious what your thoughts are so feel free to leave your ideas in the comments. A couple parts of the story might be left out because I am not sure what would be perfect to add there. But you can **expand my story**! Sorry for this, but hope you like it anyway!

Also, it was pointed out to me that one specific moment in the middle of my story might be too similar to the famous leaked plot of Episode IX. So, I guess, **possible spoiler warning**!

**Who were Rey's parents after all? Will Kylo Ren redeem himself? Will Poe's mysterious past come back to haunt him? Will the Jedi Order rise again? And how is Palpatine mixed up in all this? Read the story to find out!**

**Here we go!**

The movie starts with a **flashback**. Months after Return of the Jedi, peaceful forest planet. Shots of calming landscape and suddenly the training lightsabers clash. **Young Luke and Leia** train for a while, after that they sit on a log and talk. Leia tells her brother that she's pregnant and is afraid that she'll be a bad mother because of everything that happened during the war. Luke reassures her that she'll be a great mom.

A smooth transition to the very same place many years later. **Five years** after the events of The Last Jedi, to be exact. The First Order has been fighting the growing in numbers Resistance for a while now. At the same spot where Luke used to teach Leia the ways of the Force, is now **Rey** trying to meditate. Small rocks and twigs around her float in the air, **Leia** is watching Rey from afar. Rey notices Leia and they talk about Luke and that she is the only hope for the Jedi Order to **rise** again.

Suddenly **the First Order** Star Destroyers appear in the sky. Somehow, the First Order found out where this particular Resistance base is located. There are many Resistance headquarters around the galaxy, but this is the main one with General Organa, Rey, Finn, Poe and others here.

The battle begins with an AT-M6 and countless stormtroopers attacking the Resistance base - a big black brick castle that looks kind of like Maz's castle on Takodana. The Resistance fights back and we quickly get reacquainted with our main characters. **Chewbacca**, blasting his way through armies of the First Order. **Finn** and Nien Numb, leading the Resistance troops. **Poe**, skillfully shooting the stormtroopers.

**Kylo Ren**, along with the **Knights of Ren**, joins the battle. For the first time in Star Wars, we see our big bad fighting on the battlefield, leading soldiers into battle, massacring the enemies. Kylo no longer struggles between the Dark Side and the Light. He embraces the darkness and is very powerful now, perhaps, even more powerful than Vader. **Kylo's theme** is back, mixed in with epic score of the battle!

Poe is the first one to notice Kylo and alarms the others. Finn joins Poe against Ren but he quickly overpowers both of them. Chewbacca joins the fight and Kylo without a word attacks him. Personally, I've been waiting for Ben and Chewie to have a silent moment like this since The Force Awakens.

Meanwhile, Resistance decides to **evacuate**. Leia and Rey join Rose leading their allies to safety. When a squad of stormtroopers interferes, Rey defeats them, revealing us her new lightsaber: it's **blue** and **double-bladed** (Darth Maul style). It is unclear yet how she created it or where she found it, leaving it up to the expanded universe to fill the gaps.

The Resistance boards the cruisers and manages to get away from the First Order. Leia decides to hide on another Resistance base on the **desert planet of Pasaana**. She tasks our main characters (Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, C-3PO and BB-8) to meet her contact (he goes by the code name **Gambler**) that could help the Resistance once more. Heroes leave on the Millenium Falcon. Rose and Finn say their goodbyes, fearing they might not meet again. R2-D2 stays with Leia.

I would like to emphasize that the **heroes have changed** since the last time we saw them. Poe is more level-headed and wise, he thinks clearly and doesn't rush into the fight. Finn is loyal to the Resistance and fights not out of hate but in order to protect his friends. Rey is no longer fixates on the past and is focused on the present instead. Because of all the Jedi books she read, she is now focused on **rebuilding the Jedi Order** as it once was during the Old Republic. Her plotline in this movie is realizing the failures of the Jedi and creating a new order of Force-users and the galaxy protectors.

While Rey follows all teachings of the Jedi Code, even that the attachments are forbidden, Kylo Ren is as evil as you may think. He is fully focused on destroying the Resistance, with General Hux following him everywhere.

The **main conflict of the movie** is about Palpatine, of course. The movie explains at some point that the Jedi Force ghosts appear to certain people. For example, Yoda and Obi-Wan only appear to Luke, so nobody else can see them or talk to them. Luke will only appear to Rey. But the **Sith Force ghosts** come back to haunt certain places. Palpatine right now dwells in the ruins of Death Star II on the forest moon of **Endor**.

Palpatine gets more powerful because of Kylo Ren and Rey getting more powerful. When both **Light and Dark** will reach their peak, he will be resurrected. In order to do so, Palpatine has to lead Rey and Kylo to the Death Star II ruins. Since **Darth Vader's helmet** was on the station when Palpatine died, Darth Sidious can talk and influence Kylo through it. By the way, Ren in my version of the movie doesn't reforge his old helmet.

From now on and up until the final battle the movie is **a big adventure**. Our heroes travel to different planets, split up and meet again, get to know new characters. Every main character has their own plotline. For example, Poe lacks confidence but also wants to lead the crew, which is the reason for arguments between him and Rey. Kylo Ren talks to Palpatine and is trying to find the main characters and Rey before they get back to the Resistance.

Leia's contact is revealed to be **Lando Calrissian**. After the events of the Return of the Jedi he was living on a distant casino planet somewhat similar to Canto Bight. But at some point between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker the First Order takes over the planet and nobody is allowed to leave. Lando and the natives assemble into **a small rebellion** but it's still impossible to gain control of the planet.

When our heroes arrive and get through the First Order blockade (Rey and Poe sneak on board of the FO ship to find out what is happening and when they get busted they hide and, similar to Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in the beginning of Episode I, get down to the planet; others on the Falcon also are spotted by TIE-Fighters and after the battle find themselves on the planet where everyone reunites again), they meet the rebels and are brought to meet Lando. Together they leave the planet and Lando joins the crew (the rebels leave on ships that were previously confiscated by the First Order) but the adventure doesn't end here. During the escape **Rey risks everything** (this leads to further conflict with Poe) and steals a decrypted recording which reveals some sort of secret that will help win the war. The heroes arrive to a **frigid planet Kijimi**. It's really dark here almost all the time. A small town of Ahch-To-like huts on a lonely mountain.

Heroes find a droidsmith Babu Frik. The crew's goal is to decipher the recording Rey stole but C-3PO can't do that without certain modifications. They have to do it quickly because the First Order can track them. It is revealed that in order to install the modifications they will have to **wipe the droid's memory**. While the heroes argue about it (Rey is certain that this is the only way and attachments are forbidden, duh) 3PO in an act of **self-sacrifice** erases his memories to decipher the message, saying goodbye to his friends and regretting R2 wasn't there.

The recording not only helps the Resistance (I don't know how yet, but that's why 3PO ""sacrifices"" himself) but also reveals **the mystery of Rey's parents**. They were the ones who left this message. They were actually **rebels** during the Galactic Civil War and they were the first to find out the biggest secret of the First Order (they had to leave Rey in order to do so; the secret is the key to stopping the FO once and for all and is used by the Resistance in the final battle). They were killed seconds after recording this message but they had time to apologize for not coming back. The scene of decryption reminds of a scene from Rogue-One when Jyn gets a message from her father. The scene is very emotional and Rey finally gets the answer she's been looking for.

At this point the First Order finds the heroes and Star Destroyers appear in the sky. **Stormtroopers arrive** at the factory and the heroes are cornered but suddenly a new character - bounty hunter **Zorii Bliss -** appears and helps them. It is later revealed that Poe has a history with her. Once they were in love with each other but had a falling out when Poe, being a bounty hunter as well, joined the New Republic and the Resistance. Poe also owes Zorii money. All of this is revealed during a slightly emotional scene between the two. Zorii has a little droid D-O who becomes a friend to BB-8. The droids are the main source of jokes and humor in the movie.

The First Order can't find the heroes and starts killing people to lure them out. Poe and Zorii distract the stormtroopers while Finn, Chewbacca, Lando and the droids quickly get to the Falcon and come back to their friends. Rey senses Kylo Ren and stays on the planet to confront him and win some time for her allies to get away. Zorii joins the heroes and they **escape** on the Millenium Falcon. While Poe and Finn are shooting the TIE-fighters with the Falcon's cannons, **Lando and Chewie** are piloting the ship.

Remember the first trailer? Remember that scene when Rey is on the desert planet and Kylo is flying on his fighter and she destroys it with her lightsaber? Well, this is this scene but on Kijimi, not Pasaana. Kylo, like Obi-Wan in Episode III, jumps out of his crashed fighter and immediately attacks Rey. This is their **first duel** in this film and it's kind of short but very unusual.

Here's why. Remember Rey's visions in The Force Awakens when she touched Luke's lightsaber? When Kylo and Rey fight, they both have such **visions** as if they were fighting someplace else. But during this short duel there is only one vision: deserts of Pasaana where the Resistance is located now. This way Kylo learns where the First Order has to strike next. Also, they talk a little bit during their confrontation, Kylo antagonizes Rey by reminding her of her parents' failure. There are references to Kylo and Rey meeting during the five year time skip (this will be covered in the comics and/or books).

The fight stops when the Falcon returns to help Rey. She pushes Ren using the Force into a very deep snow cave and gets on the ship like **Qui-Gon** did after his first fight with Maul on Tatooine. After that, the First Order is chasing the Falcon and finally **captures** the heroes. They are taken to one of the Star Destroyers where the Knights of Ren await them. They have orders from Kylo to capture Rey and wait for his return. The stormtroopers search the ship and everyone is brought to the Knights of Ren except for Rey who is nowhere to be found.

Rey feels as if something is calling her through the Force and hides from the First Order soldiers. She sneaks through the corridors and finds herself in Kylo's living quarters where she finds **Darth Vader's helmet**. Palpatine is the one calling Rey and he tries to influence her just like he did with Kylo but she resists. The scene reminds of Rey and Kylo's Force bond in The Last Jedi except we don't see Palpatine. Instead, we see Death Star II ruins on the moon of Endor. When Rey manages to break their bond we finally get a glimpse of Palpatine's spirit (barely visible) screaming in anger.

I'm not sure what happens next; the plotlines develop, the Knights of Ren are involved and finally the characters escape and Zorii leaves the crew. Before that, Poe tries to convince Zorii to join the Resistance, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Kylo is alive. He returns to the Star Destroyer and **kills** General Hux for failing him, making **Pryde** the new General.

I mean, obviously, we've seen Vader killing Admiral Ozzel and Captain Needa, but they were mostly ""nobodies"" to us. We've known Hux for a while now and seeing Kylo murdering him like that makes Ren even more evil.

Our heroes **reunite** with Leia and the Resistance on Pasaana and warn them that the First Order is coming. New C-3PO meets **R2-D2**. By the way, for some reason I imagine Pasaana more like Geonosis rather than Tatooine (I'm talking about the sand color). Geonosis was our first real grand-scale battle and Pasaana will be our last.

And that's how **the most epic battle in the history of cinema** begins. All allies of the Resistance stand together, including Lando's rebels. We see many familiar species like the **Gungans** of Naboo, the **Wookiees** of Kashyyyk, the **Duros** of Duro, the **Mon Calamari** of Mon Cala, etc. Zorii comes back to help. She is not alone and brings some of the fellow bounty hunters.

The battle rages on in space and on the surface of the planet. Our main characters split up. Rey, Chewbacca and **Jannah** (leader of Lando's rebellion) fight on the surface while Finn, Poe and Zorii try to get on the main Star Destroyer and use the information received from Rey's parents. Heroes take part in getting from one ship to another (similar to how the final trailer showed us Resistance soldiers riding some creatures on a Star Destroyer).

During the extremely long and epic battle Rey has a vision (apparently created by Palpatine) of Death Star II ruins and leaves on an **X-Wing**. She gets to the forest moon of Endor and finds the ruins. There she climbs on top (reference to her scavenger days on Jakku; **Rey's Theme** is playing in the background, masterpiece as always) and enters **the throne room** where Kylo and the Knights of Ren await her.

Two **most powerful Force-users** of this era duel and Palpatine becomes stronger because of the Force energy around them. This is **the longest duel** in Star Wars. Rey and Kylo have visions again. The Force takes them to places where Light and Dark faced each other in epic battles. At first they are fighting on **Naboo**, where Maul killed Qui-Gon, then on **Geonosis** (Dooku vs Yoda), on **Mustafar**, where Obi-Wan confronted Anakin. After that the duel continues in the **Death Star I** hangar, on **Bespin** and, finally, in the throne room with Palpatine watching the duel and laughing. John Williams brings back his famous pieces like **Duel of the Fates, Jango's Escape, Battle of the Heroes, Imperial Attack, The Duel** and **The Emperor.**

Death Star II ruins start to rise from the water. Palpatine gets stronger but he can't resurrect himself completely yet. He **possesses** the Knight of Ren one by one and tries to kill Kylo and Rey. Their deaths are the final step of his plan. Rey and Kylo have to **work together** to kill the Knights of Ren and after that Palpatine possesses Kylo.

Palpatine manipulates Rey (just like he did with Luke in Episode VI) and makes her **fall to the Dark Side** to defeat him. Rey embraces the darkness, all the emotions she's been trying to suppress for the last five years. This shows us **the biggest flaw of the Jedi**: suppressing emotions and fear of the Dark Side is against everything the Force really stands for and will eventually lead to a terrible outcome.

Rey defeats Kylo/Palpatine, stabs him in the stomach and **cuts off his hand**. She stands over him. Kylo is still alive. Palpatine is stronger now and is ready to start the process of rebirth; Kylo regains control. Palpatine's influence is gone for now. Kylo understands that if he'll stay alive, Palpatine will take his Force energy and rule the galaxy once more. And if Rey kills Kylo, there is no going back and Palpatine will make her his new apprentice. Kylo **kills himself**, paying for all the evil he had done.

Personally, I think this is the best way for the Skywalker bloodline to end. If Kylo was fully redeemed, he would be just another Darth Vader. But at the same time I don't want the ending to this bloodline to be associated with darkness. This way, Kylo stays evil and **saves the galaxy** at the same time. He still wants to rule the galaxy at this point, but he understands that Palpatine will only destroy it.

With Kylo's death and Rey still on **the Light Side**, Death Star II ruins collapse and fall into the ocean, killing Palpatine forever. Rey manages to escape and watches the sinking debris from the shore.

Meanwhile, **the Resistance wins the war**. General Pryde dies. Heroes all live, but the Millenium Falcon is destroyed. Finn and Poe are trying to find Rey but they don't know where to look.

Rey still holds onto the Jedi teachings. She realizes how close she was to falling to the Dark Side and decides **to go into exile**. She arrives to Ahch-To and, just like Luke many years ago, drowns her X-Wing and throws her lightsaber off a cliff. But a ghostly hand catches the lightsaber right before it hits the water.

Rey meets **Luke Skywalker**. Luke explains that the Jedi weren't perfect and their biggest failure was that they viewed the balance of the Force as the Light Side. In reality, embracing emotions and attachments is the right way. Luke convinces Rey to create **a new order** to bring peace to the galaxy and balance to the Force.

We get a glimpse of what happens in the **future**. Leia and Poe are the senators of the New Republic. Finn, Rose and Chewie search for remnants of the First Order and fight for freedom and justice across the galaxy on a new unique ship that replaces the Falcon. The galaxy is free once more.

**The last scene in the film**. Twenty years after the defeat of the First Order. We're on the same planet from the beginning of the movie, where Luke trained Leia. There is a new temple built - **the Skywalker Temple** (looks like Yavin IV Rebellion base). That's the new order Rey created and called to honor the Skywalker bloodline. That's what the title **""The Rise of Skywalker""** actually means.

Rey is sitting outside with a dozen younglings. She's telling them about the Force. From afar the Force ghosts of **Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Anakin Skywalker and Luke** watch Rey and the beautiful **binary sunrise**, **the Force Theme** is playing as the movie ends.",StarWars,1572273259,AlexSkywalker4,11,2,True,2019-10-28

445,My wants for Luke Skywalker and Ep 9,"I am currently 16 I discovered Starwars when I was around three, my dad used to tell me bed time stories which actually were movies of his time and amazingly he told me the story of one Luke Skywalker which led to an instant fascination with Starwars besides stories the thing that familiarize me with Starwars was The Clone Wars CGI tv show which was on Cartoon Network and I loved the heck out of it but the only thing was that the characters we followed were Obi Wan and Anakin and my main interest always lied with Luke Skywalker. It always did. We didn't have the movies at the time so My knoledge of the legendary Luke Skywalker was limit to drawings my dad made for me and what he told me and knew about him. It wasn't until I was 9 I first saw a Starwars movie...Revenge of the Sith!!! Which was amazing to me because as a Fan of the Clone Wars show I finally could see the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader something my dad had told me about a while ago. Now thing is this after seing ROS I told my dad something...""Buy me Episode 6"" and like two weeks later that dad did as such. So the first episodes I saw from the Saga were the last episodes of each respective thrilogy out at the time. And When I saw episode 6 and I saw Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and that new green lightsaber, I was mind blown...Luke Skywalker as a character was everything I had imagined...heck! He surpassed all expectetions I had for him and till this day ROTJ has been my favorite Starwars movie (I admit ESB is a better film but RTOJ had the final developments and that on of itself made it amazing) for me the way I was told the Starwars story it was Luke's story.

So, I've been thinking of this for a while now, the Skywalker Saga began with Luke Skywalker as the main protagonist on 1977 and even if you first saw the prequels first I think Luke always was the representation of the endgame and end of the story. I know Rey is now the Main Protagonist and all but with Palpatine's return on The Rise of Skywalker I think Luke and him should have a final battle where Luke finally beats him. I know a lot of people want Anakin's return some even saying that the story can't have a proper conclusion without him, but I firmly believe the highlights should be with Luke (and Rey...and Kylo should be killed by Palpatine without redemption... just make Kylo try to kill Palpatine and uttertly fail but do give closure to the poor guy make it a parallel with Vader's Ending) make Luke finish Palpatine, destroy the thing that ruined his family in a way avange his father and every one he lost along the way. Rey should be doing something that had high stakes while Luke takes Palpatine on, I'm not saying make Luke the protagonist for the last 30 minutes but give him the fight while Rey fights other odds. Sure Luke is death but so is Palpatine (and this is my fantasy which has a 50/50 of happening...I'm optimistic...😅) It would be cool to see Palpatine's reaction when he discovers Luke reached his powers even in death. Don't make it a prequel thrilogy type fight make it epic tho. Rey should be a bit amaze my the power both force users show, Palpatine in my opinion should make Rey look like a joke, that way we break the May Sue complex she has. And my perfect finales to the battle would be: 

1) Luke gives the Final Blow to Palpatine Killing him.

2) Rey AND Luke finish Palpatine off.

Also the final scene of the Saga should be with Leia...

I just want Luke to be a Hero thay wins against the ultimate villain I really feel that at the end of the Last Jedi he left all of his flaws behind. (Also if I were Ryan Johnson... Who's an amazing director btw...I would have written that Luke had been death all that time but the Force had keept him around so he could prepare Rey.)
 
Gotta be honnest as a Naive 9 year old who still wasn't an aspiring Writer and Filmmaker I always had beef with the fact that Luke never had a chance against the Emperor.🤣🤣🤣🤣 I guess this post comes from part of the Naive 9 year old...

I really want ROS to be an Amazing movie with a exploration of the Characters over the plot. I wanna see a Luke Skywalkers that finishes what he was meant to finish and I also wanna see Rey be the Main Protagonist that can compete with Luke in terms of adversities and amazingness basically be a character I can tell my children her story and have their minds blown out like I had with Luke. I want this amazing saga to have the ending it deserves (even if some feel this last thrilogy was rush) I want a ending so amazing to the story that motivated me to write my own fantasy story that it blows my mind the way my mind was blown when I first heard ""His name was Luke Skywalker"" and to make the ones who had their mind blown in 1977 feel thay sense of wonder.

448,"A Star Wars Trilogy to fill the gap between Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens, what would it look like?"," 

I had a thought, could you write a trilogy that fills the gap between RotJ and FA and what would it look like? While there is big gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, there isn't a ton going on with the Skywalkers that would fill a trilogy. Meanwhile there is 30 years worth of history that happens and it almost feels like we missed out on a whole trilogy between 6 and 7. I'm not up to speed on most of the books and media that have already filled some of these gaps so that's why they aren't referenced here.

After thinking about this I realized that it ends up looking similar to the Prequel Trilogy. This makes sense given the similarities between the OT and the ST. I am mostly trying to fill the gaps with a story that makes sense with some creative freedom. I am sure this will change once we see the Rise of Skywalker.

**Episode 1**: Luke is starting a new Jedi order and teaches young Ben Solo. He learns about the force, Yoda, Obi-Wan and his grandfather, who he becomes very interested in. He is more powerful than the other Padawans and this makes Leia and Han nervous, but they trust him under Luke. We see the state of the galaxy with the struggle to establish a new Republic vs. the Imperial Remnants. We also get some scenes of Luke training Leia a bit? We get to see Leia and Han happy together as a couple and raising a child together.

**Episode 2**: Ben is now in his late teens/early 20s and has become a powerful Jedi. The New Republic is established and empire defeated for good (or for now anyways). In this movie he completes his Jedi training by meeting and talking with the force ghost of Anakin who warns him not to make the same mistake he did. Luke and Ben run into the Knights of Ren and while investigating them they run into Snoke. They fight them off before Luke slashes Snoke in the head (giving him his scar). During the movie we begin to see that Kylo become more interested in Darth Vader rather than the now god Anakin. Luke talks with his fathers force ghost and promises to not let Ben turn to the dark side.

**Episode 3**: Basically Revenge of the Sith again with Ben falling to the dark side by being Snokes apprentice after Luke attempts to kill him and the First Order rises from the shadows. Ben becomes the leader of the Knights of Ren and they kill most of Luke's students. We see Han and Leia's relationship deteriorate and Leia starts the Resistance. Luke goes into exile.

My main takeaway from the rewatch is that the entire Poe/Finn/Rose sub-plot isn't just badly paced and ham-handed. When viewed from in-universe, they're entire contribution to the plot is to get the vast majority of the remaining resistance members killed. If they had just sat back, played cards, and waited for orders, the transports likely would have all made it to the krait. If, in IX, they are referred to as anything other than ""those fuck-ups that got our friends killed"", then no one is paying attention.

I wouldn’t really call Rey a Mary Sue but considering that Anakin who’s basically had force still had to train for years to be strong her progress is to fast .I honestly just need to see her get a injury or lose a fight with no circumstances giving her a win or her opponent a loss .Anakin and Luke lost their hands and ezra Anakin and kylo have facial scars.Ashoka may not have scars but we’ve seen her just lose fair and square.

You can be a overpowered character but their have to be extreme character flaws like the homelander or extreme trials like Goku.The homelander is a sociopath and goku has been through more near death experience than you can count along with always training.

I don’t see how she beat Kylo he was the first Skywalker to be trained by birth by Jedi along with being trained by snoke.I assume Kylo is just as connected to the force as Anakin and Luke.A lightsaber is honestly a weird weapon even with the force you still have to learn .Like I said Anakin at least in the clone wars show wasn’t much stronger than ventress and he’s the chosen one.Its honestly weird to see a Star Wars Mc never get hurt.",StarWars,1572293378,Volthoom33,73,0,True,2019-10-28

A lot of fans were mad they didn't follow the Legends books.

If they had followed the Legends books, people would complain that Disney can't think of anything new.

And therein lies the problem. 

When Disney makes a new character, like in the Mandalorian, people ask ""Why isn't it Boba Fett?"" But if they had made a Boba Fett tv show, then people will say, ""Disney is out of ideas and just going to milk everything out of these old characters.""

I also think 30 years of headcanon and novels doesn't help. It's hard when you envision things going one way for so long to accept that your favorite characters took a different path. And it's not really anyone's fault. Lucasfilm can't adapt everyone's headcanon into movies.

As we know, Anakin's final interaction with Padmé is to force choke her, after which she dies of a broken heart. This is, to put it mildly, lame. It is also a missed opportunity. To my mind, it would have been far more effective for Anakin, in his rage, to use a burst of force lightning from his organic arm to attack her. Because it's new, and beyond his control, it's more than he expects but the dark side has him in his grip. He uses it to take out his anger. This accomplishes a number of things:

1) It gives Padmé a realistic reason to die rather than simply giving up on her newborn children.

2) It demonstrates Anakin's descent isn't entirely voluntary and he's in the grip of something he doesn't fully understand.

3) It makes RotJ much more impactful - Vader is reliving his greatest mistake when Luke is being tortured and it makes his redemption stronger. Enduring the lightning to save his son puts him through what Padmé experienced. It also makes his decision in RotJ more logical, since as it stands he just changes his mind despite having amputated Luke's hand and threatened to kill him every time they have met. Force lightning could serve as both the death and resurrection of his good side.

469,"I've always sort of wondered, why aren't Jedi Knights referred to as Knight [name]?","We know that there is basically four rankings in the Jedi Order. Youngling, Padawan, Knight, and Master.

**Younglings** are pretty self explanatory, they are children who are training and learning in the temples but have yet to be chosen as a Padawan. They can be as young as toddlers or as old as young teens.

**Padawans** are Younglings that are chosen to recieve further training from a Knight or Master. This seems to usually happen when the child is around its species' young teenage years. Like 13 or 14, though it isn't impossible for one to be a little older or younger (Anakin was 9 and skipped the Youngling rank entierly).

**Knights** are Padawans who have been trained to the point where their Master believes they are ready to undergo the Jedi Trials, a series of tests that allow them to graduated if passed. It is also possible for a Padawan to graduate if they encounter a situation that is on par or exceeds the Trials, such as with Obi-Wan after defeating Maul.

**Masters** are Knights that have either successfully trained a Padawan to Knighthood, the most common method, or have developed their skills and wisdom to the level of a Master.

Yet, for whatever reason once a Jedi is a Knight it seems most, if not all, other Jedi then refer to them as Master. Of course it is understandable for a Jedi's Padawan to refer to them as Master even if they are still technically a Knight, but you never heard anyone else refer to Knights by their rank. No Knight Kenobi (when he was training Anakin) or Knight Skywalker. Younglings are called Younglings, Padawans are refered to as Padawans (like Ahsoka as ""Padawan Tano"").

475,I recently started thinking of a star's fanfiction read years ago and was wondering if anyone else Read it,"The plot takes place during the old republic era. Is about the son of a smuggler I think he is a teenager but he might be younger.I think the story takes place before the treaty of coruscant because the war between the Republican and sith still ongoing.and the main characters mom is smuggling supplies to allies of the republic.

one of the first scenes in the story is she gives her son a blaster she specially made for him so he can protect himself. Their ship is shot down by the sith military and they crash land on a remote planet. The main character asked the family Droid if they died and the Droid replies if we died heaven is a jungle planet. Unfortunately the main characters mom was injured and died in the crash.He and the family enjoy spending several most alone in the jungle.

Eventually the main character finds into two people on the planet one is an older human and the other is a teenage girl she is described as having red eyes blue skin and canine teeth so I think she's a chriss. The author hints that there a Jedi master and his Padawan. The girl attacks the main character wounding him but the older guy stops her from doing too much harm and helps to nurse the main character back to health.

The girl later apologizes for hurting him and they eventually form a friendship. Later the two of them are adventuring in the jungle and they come across some type of predator that has spikes on it. The girl wants to jump on its back to steal one of the spikes the main character is against this but is pure pressured into it. They both fall off its back and are attacked by the creature but they somehow managed to kill it.

Unfortunately for them the creature was only a cub and its mother is angry. Of the girl in the main character are wounded by the mother but are saved by the older man who uses his lightsaber to kill the mother.

after being wounded the main character lost consciousness but when he wakes up he sees the older man. He tells the main character that he senses the force in him and that he thinks he is ready to begin his training.he tells the main character that usually he would give him a lightsaber but that he thinks that any weapon that the wielder holds a strong connection to will do and gives the main character back the blaster that was given to him by his mom at the beginning of the story.

484,I have an idea of how they might bring back palpatine.,"During the final season of star wars rebels (which is disney canon), they introduce a concept called the ""world between worlds"". Its basically a place outside of time and space that connects different points in time in the star wars universe. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v254mgxMmG8

This episode also sets up that not only does the emperor know about this place (and that it can be used to reach into the past and future), but he's actively trying to use it to gain control over the past and future, and he has high level imperial researchers searching the galaxy looking for information on this place outside of time, and how to access it. 

Now this could just be a red herring, or something the showrunners decided to introduce on their own as an idea that they thought was cool. But what if it isnt? What if they set up this idea for a reason? They show in the episode that it can be used to subvert ones death via ezra pulling ahsoka into this dimension right before vader can strike her down on malachor in season 2.

504,"A rewrite of Vader's Transformation, from his perspective","Anakin awoke, having passed out from the suffering he endured on Mustafar. He was strapped to an operating table, and above him was a bright, white light. It disoriented, and dizzied his damaged eyes. He could not speak. Every part of him itched, and blood stains were splotched across the burnt corpse he called a body.

Droids seemed to tower over him, and vaguely said words. Why couldn't he hear them? It was because of the injuries he sustained, he thought. 

Then, a cold, sharp pain entered his stump of a leg.

And another one.

And another one.

He let out screams, howls of desperation. The incision blades entered his leathery burnt skin, to cut and make way for crude prosthetics.

**PADMÉ!""**

He roared. His wife, the only person who loved him and the only person he loved was the thing keeping him alive.

And then; silence.

He awoke again, presumably hours later. He felt his new, inferior prosthetics. And saw something in his peripheral vision. 

A suit, being prepared for him.

He could breathe again, because of modifications made to his respiratory system. Everything felt weird, out of place.

He screamed again, realizing he had nothing left. A broken man, in body and soul. All that remained of the great Anakin Skywalker.

And again, he fell to unconscious.

One more time; he awoke. A sleek black suit covered his disgusting, charred body. A mask was hovering above him, and the chirping of the droid that lowered it could be heard behind him.

""Padmé, help me.""

He was terrified. His burnt vocal chords made him speak in whispers. The mask latched to his face, sealing away the man.

Then, his heart stopped.

Anakin Skywalker died.

Breathing could be heard from the suit. The operating table rose, showcasing the gleaming suit the man laid inside.

""Lord Vader.... can you hear me?""

A shrill, evil voice said from the shadows. It belonged to his friend, Palpatine. 

""....Yes, Master."" 

He remembered. He was Vader now. That was his title. 

""Where is Padmé? Is she safe? Is she alright?""

The man was surprised to hear the booming voice that emanated from him, expecting the weak voice he once had.

""It seems.... in your anger, you.... killed her.""

The man's heart stopped again, for a moment.

""I.... I **couldn't have. She was alive, I FELT IT!""**

The man called upon the Force, crushing everything in the room except Palpatine. He broke free from the table, collapsing to his knees.

**""NOOOO!""**

512,Kotor 1 and Kotor 2 vs The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi- A comparison and why I prefer the former," 
After replaying both games again I noticed how Bioware (back when they were great) and Obsidian did the whole paying tribute to the OT and subverting expectations thing before Disney did..but they handled it way better.

Kotor 1 is more like classic Star Wars and hits a lot of the similiar beats of the OT (down to the unexpected twist) but it still feels unique enough instead of a rip off. TFA was a lazy rehash of ANH in comparison, there was no need to return to the exact same old Empire vs Rebels narrative, extinct Jedi etc. even if they wanted the classic Star Wars feeling back.

Kotor 2 is a deconstruction of Star Wars like TLJ wants to be but again the execution is far superior. It really goes in depth with the Jedi, Sith and the force..while TLJ does it in such a shallow way and never even commits to it properly. You can see how Chris avellone gets Star Wars and wanted to do something interesting while Rian Johnson didn't..it's no surprise that Chris also disliked how Luke was handled in TLJ. It was poorly done. Revan meanwhile was if anything improved in Kotor 2.

I get that the prequels introduced new planets and the Original Trilogy established everything, but at least with the Prequels and Original Trilogy, they knew when to get on with the story rather than creating an ever rapidly increasing list of new wacky looking species and environments just for the hell of it.

Not to mention we are starting to get TV shows, comics and books that are almost required to understand the continuation of the Star Wars universe. Disney has pretty much pulled a Halo 5 (if you all remember how that went) and is making us do homework if we want to understand the big picture, rather than letting the movies do that. It's at the point where books and comics are telling the crucial plot points that should have been in the movies. I think the most egregious ones are the detailed looks into the New Republic and the recent comic of Ben Solo and Luke fighting the Knights of Ren. Idk, at this point the movies are feeling more and more like the supplement rather than the actual main source of the plot.",StarWars,1572357662,KhajiitHasWares2077,22,0,True,2019-10-29

537,Mandalorian Prediction about Boba Fett that I want to get on the record before the show starts...,"So there has obviously been endless speculation about whether Boba is the Mandalorian, whether he will be in the show, or if he will be completely uninvolved. I think he definitely is NOT ""The Mandalorian"" main protagonist, but I do believe we will see something like this:


The Mandalorian is on an important mission, to recover either some sort of artifact or bounty. He succeeds, and as we approach the end of the episode he returns to a Cantina-like setting to meet his contact. The person he meets says something to the effect of ""The drop-off is at the table over there, he's waiting for you..."" and points The Mandalorian in the right direction. He approaches the table, the camera turns, and we see Temuera Morrison with a Sarlacc-scarred face, wearing salvaged armor that is new but reminiscent enough that it is undeniably Boba. He drops a sharp one liner, cut to black, episode ends.


Now I'm not exactly sure whether I expect this to be in the premier or finale to tease Season 2, but with the recent news about the first episode containing a Star Wars ""Spoiler"" I believe it might be the former.


I think this would be a great way to introduce Boba as an occasional supporting role that could expand on his canon lore like some people are hoping for, while still letting the main protagonist be a fresh new character as the show-runners have repeatedly stated is their goal.


Let me know what you think. Whether or not Boba ends up incorporated at all, the trailers look INCREDIBLE and I can't wait regardless.",StarWars,1572361260,Free-ON,7,16,True,2019-10-29

547,"I think Anime is a great medium for Star Wars, specifically Lightsaber combat experiences."," I just realized that anime would serve Star Wars very well for lightsaber duels. 

&amp;#x200B;

The books (yes, I KNOW Legends isn't canon anymore, but don't throw out amazing ideas/tools/storytelling devices with it!) go into great detail during the fights about WHY a person loses, whereas the movies make it look terrible (why did Anakin open his arm for Dooku to cut it off?). 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in the Revenge of the Sith book, Obi-Wan vs. Grievous, it mentions him using his lightsaber style, Soresu, which focuses on defense. Grievous' attacks look crazy from a ""4 lightsabers?!"" perspective, but when Obi-Wan is used to blocking blasterfire from hundreds of droids, it's actually not that bad. And since Soresu focuses on minimal motions to maximize defense, the book shows how all it takes is for him to alter the angle of his block ever so slightly, so that instead of meeting the blade it meets Grievous's hand instead, winking the blade out a fraction of a second before it would have sliced his head.     


In anime, battle moments that are really only a second long are vastly extended so the character can explain exactly why they are about to win, or why this technique is the perfect counter to the enemy's attack, etc. It would be perfect for lightsaber duels to really bring home certain things for those more visually inclined (would rather watch than read). 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, why did Qui-Gon lose to Maul? During their fight, have Qui-Gon and Maul both inner-monologuing about the fact that his lightsaber combat form (Ataru) focuses heavily on acrobatics, which in the small space they wound up in wasn't able to happen. Each one could be thinking to themselves about the fight, mention fatigue, the strength or weakness of the enemy's blows, etc. Once they get into the reactor room, things start to turn bad for Qui-Gon, and they both feel it and react inner-monologue anime style. Then they could both voiceover at the same time: ""Leading to only one conclusion..."" and then he is stabbed. It would be a great moment of reflection for Qui-Gon on his coming death, and a moment of exultation for Maul for defeating a Master (which in turn would explain his pathetic defeat at the hands of a Padawan, pride and all that).    


I have been disappointed in lightsaber fights in the movies ever since I read the books, because it becomes clear that the expanded universe material that tries to retcon certain things (adding lightsaber forms to different characters' styles, etc.) is clearly retcon because the actual portrayal in the movies is nothing close to what it describes in later content.

Chewie went as far as kicking Stormtrooper ass and Vader still stopped his murder. Leia of course noticed this and was confused by it.

Now perhaps you could interpret this moment as Vader trying to prevent Boba from inadvertently killing Han as Han was meant to be bait for Luke. I dispute this by Boba’s skill and his stake in making sure Han survived. Hell, Leila’s captivity alone would be enough to bait Luke.

554,The Canon Revan Problem,"So Revan is a fan favorite character from the Bioware RPG Knights of the old Republic. He is exceptionally popular in the Star Wars fanbase and is generally regarded as an interesting and excellent character. His canonicity is slightly in flux at the moment but he has been featured in a post legends EU cell phone game and almost showed up in an episode of The Clone Wars. He/she is effectively ""semi-canon"" in that Disney has expressed an interest in solidifying Revan as a canon character but has been a little nebulous in doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally feel that Revan is a worthy addition to the current canon from a distance but presents a few problems when examined more closely. If Revan serves as the great example of a dark side user returned to the light he is fascinating in the stereotypical ""general vs AP history"" way in that he gets held up as an example of a dark side user returned to the light but holy hell is there more to the story. Revan himself is a mysterious figure owing to his nature as a player creation. However even with this ambiguity he fits into the lore as both an idealistic beacon and a warning which resonates well with Luke's experiences. As Luke is effectively one of the two primary protagonists of the the Star Wars film franchise (the prequels are his origin, the OT is his story and the sequels are the fallout of his adventures) along with his father, Revan serves as a useful thematic pillar to compare himself and his father both in and out of universe.",StarWars,1569646112,Canid117,15,6,True,2019-09-28

Do you think something like Keanu Reeves as Revan would line-up, or re-animate something like Revan in the Knights of The Old Republic MMO? I personally think that considering how the MCU was wrapped together with Earth 616 - maybe not with these specific actors - that the idea of Legends being manipulated or re-written into the new Canon, this could be a possibility. Obviously a lot of Star Wars fans will be mad about this, a lot of Star Wars fans hate the new  Mortis arc with Ahsoka, and honestly, I remember when Abeloth was introduced in Legends - I didn't like it either initially. Though Fiege brought the MCU in Marvel to a conclusive canon, and the comics by Jonathan Hickman have been an amazing elaboration. Claudia Day and Deliah Dawson have brought us interesting backlogs for the films in the Star Wars Universe.  If the future of Star Wars was to revolve around these three actors, while adjoined with a pretty significant writers' room would you look into it or be intrigued?

579,Anyone else kinda underwhelmed by Jedi: Fallen Order so far?,"Sorry for the long posts, you can skip ahead and comment your thoughts if you’d like.

When I first heard about the game and saw the posters I was super stoked, it’s objectively a great concept (and let’s be honest those purge troopers looked dope af)

But as more and more info, trailers and gameplay comes out, i get less and less excited.

My main problem is the look of the game. I know it’s unfinished, but even the BF2 trailers and actual gameplay were ALOT more polished. 

Obviously looks aren’t everything but with the big story driven aspect of the game I’d like a good looking one. (Yikes on those Wookiee in the gameplay trailer)

Secondly, there seems to be a big focus on “boss” battles with big creatures, not a fan of that. 

Thirdly, my opinion of this game would be WAY higher if it features dismemberment.  This ties in to the parts of the game I actually like, the way it plays. I absolutely love the way the actual combat looks, it’s like dark souls but StarWars-ified. But when Cal drives a lightsaber straight through someone mid section, i expect them to fall into two pieces.

Now, I’m not just bitching alright, the characters are great, the plot so far seems great the content their canonizing seems great, I’m just worried their gonna butcher another great idea.

581,"Are there any good articles, blog posts, videos etc. about the reasons why Lucas' trilogies are so different?","There's no doubt that originals and prequels are very different in many ways, among them seriousness (at least in Ep I and II), target audience and all those things. You probably know what I mean.

Now I'm wondering why that is since a long time. It just stuns me that the same man who created Star Wars suddenly wrote scripts about pod racing and transforming the force from a spiritual concept to a biological mechanism (just as it stuns me that Peter Jackson created both LotR and the Hobbit movies, to mention this related topic)

Some people claim in discussions that the main reason is that back in the 70s Lucas was surrounded by good advisers and he had to follow their advice to some degree, whereas later as a very rich producer he could do what he wanted without anyone daring to challenge the father of SW. True or not, I never saw any sources on this topic.

&gt;!""The final confrontation of the Skywalker Saga takes place on the dead world of Exogol. Darth Sidious has thrown Ben Solo into the abyss. I have heard Ben falls into the mist, much like Han Solo’s death in The Force Awakens and it visually rhymes. I believe this happens after Rey and Ben are drained by Darth Sidious. In the end, Rey weakened and seemingly alone for the final confrontation.""

&gt;! If Ben is resurrected, sources are not aware of it. That said, how many characters have fallen to their deaths in Star Wars and stayed gone? Hell, even Harrison Ford returns in this movie after his death in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Darth Maul survived with little on screen explanation. Luke Skywalker fell on Bespin, it wasn’t pleasant but he was okay. Palpatine got tossed into a pit by Darth Vader and he apparently turns up in this film as an old shriveled up version of Sidious in a bed.

&gt;! ""I theorize that when Rey is rejuvenated to face Palpatine, Ben Solo may be the power from the “other side” that helps Rey in the end. But as of now that is conjecture on my part.""

&gt;! ""The rejuvenated Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, projects Sith lightning into the heavens above from his fingertips believing Rey to be incapacitated. Rey, however, is revitalized by the Jedi who lived before her for the final confrontation with Palpatine. She slowly begins to rise as Palpatine zaps the Resistance fleet with his torrent of lightning.
Above the dead planet, the Resistance fleet and the First Order’s Sith fleet are about to clash.  The blasts of lightning from Darth Sidious’ fingertips into the sky above acts as supernatural EMP that causes the Resistance fleet to essentially short out and float dead in the “waters” of space, making it vulnerable to the Sith fleet. It appears in that moment that all is lost.
Darth Sidious is ready to retake his place as Galactic Emperor when Rey interrupts the Sith’s victory and stands before her grandfather.
The restored Rey catches Darth Sidious’ attention and he is forced to stop his stream of Sith lightning. The Resistance fleet recovers, powers back on, and the fight against Sith fleet above Exogol ensues. Rey buys the fleet just enough time for the Millennium Falcon to show up with reinforcements for the final epic space battle.
Just as Darth Sidious lowers his hands and stops attacking the fleet above. The Sith Lord looks to Rey and angrily blasts his lightning towards *his granddaughter*. Rey ignites Leia and Anakin Skywalker’s lightsabers and deflects *her grandfather’s* attack.""

&gt;! ""After doing an extensive deep dive with sources on this film, I have to conclude that Palpatine does not use a lightsaber in the film, and if he ever did, he does not wield it in this film anymore. So I do not expect Palpatine to use his lightsaber against Rey and Ben.""

* The former Emperor has a red and black cloak.
*  The McQuarrie throne is finally used on screen but with stone thorns around it.
* Old  Palpatine siphons life into his body through Rey and Ben Solo.
* Palpatine becomes Palpatine unleashed and has more power than ever before.
* Ben Solo appears to die by being thrown into a pit by Palpatine.
* Palpatine then shocks the Resistance fleet, making it power down.
* Rey is empowered by generations of the Jedi that came before her and she rises up to face Palpatine.
* Palpatine’s attention turns towards Rey.
* The money shot is Palpatine shoots lightning in the sky and then at Rey which she deflects with Leia and Anakin’s lightsabers.
* The Resistance fleet recovers and the Falcon brings reinforcements to the battle.
* We likely have seen Exogol in the D23 First Look.
* Sith Stormtroopers appear to be elite First Order troops who were abducted as children.
* Matt Smith does not seem to be in the film as Palpatine.

590,"UNPOPULAR OPINION: The Last Jedi should've been called ""The Rise of Skywalker"" instead.","Yes, I know that *The Rise of Skywalker* is the actual title for Episode IX, but had Episode VIII had been called *The Rise of Skywalker* instead, the title would be less confusing. Now, I know what you're thinking: how is the title of *The Last Jedi* confusing? I'll tell you why:

One day, my little brother wanted to rent *The Last Jedi* on Dish because he enjoyed it (at the time, I thought it was a good movie until I rewatched it), but mistakenly searched for *Return of the Jedi* instead and referred it as *The Last Jedi*, most likely because both films have the word ""Jedi"" in the title.

Another reason why I think that Episode VIII should've been called *The Rise of Skywalker* instead is that if it was called that instead, it would've referred to Luke's character growth throughout the film and rising into action in the end.

Had Episode VIII been called *The Rise of Skywalker* instead of *The Last Jedi*, Episode IX would have a title that would accurately represent what the film is truly about. For now, let's just wait for *Skywalker*, and see what IX should've been called instead had VIII been called *The Rise of Skywalker* instead...

We know that Ming has a role in Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian as announced at D23 by Bob Iger. Her role is largely kept a secret and this could be pivotal to the plot.

But after tuning out all the bad mouthers and sitting down and watching the show, Resistance is actually a pretty good show.

Sure the animation is weird and takes some getting used to, but I remember feeling the same way when Clone Wars came out, and how herky-jerky all the characters looked. You won't find a single person complain about the animation style for Clone Wars because the shows been around for a decade at this point.

But going back to the topic at hand, I think a lot of Star Wars fans are missing out on a great show. Yeah the Last Jedi ain't hit with all cylinders firing, and I have to admit that the movie shut me out of SW for about a year until I decided to come back to the SW universe after seeing that one Last Hero Production video on Youtube titled 'Failure is the greatest teacher' or something like that.

Do you think this movie will be like three hours long? Endgame set the bar so it's not that weird, but it's longer than most SW films by far.

611,What Do YOU Love The Most About Star Wars?,"**This is a question for fans from any generation of the franchise (OT, Prequels, Sequels). What specifically first drew you to Star Wars and still appeals to you years later? Feedback is welcome, but I'd appreciate any/all discourse being respectful. We all have different preferences and I will indulge in NO insults or comment wars:**

&amp;#x200B;

What I consistently love most about the galaxy far far away is the galaxy far far away itself. This is not to say or imply by any means that I wasn't drawn to the characters, story, lore, music, and themes that built the series' foundations.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic premise of ""Good vs. evil, light vs. dark, love vs. hate, the weak vs. the powerful, oppression vs. freedom, yin vs. yang, balance vs. imbalance, etc"" has always resonated with me, as has the ""hero's journey"" template.

&amp;#x200B;

As ancient and admittedly overused as these ideas are, I believe almost everyone on some primal level can relate to the feelings &amp; idealisms they inspire even we can't relate to the fantasy aspects and most of us don't lead lives that exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

And few takes on these fundamental concepts are as timeless, well executed, or nuanced as *Star Wars*. What was initially a fairy tale aimed at 12 year olds quickly grew into this monolith that attracted people of all ages &amp; backgrounds:

&amp;#x200B;

Spaceships, aliens, droids, magic, energy swords, blasters, wizards, princesses, cowboys, bounty hunters, rebels, rogues, soldiers, warrior monks, cyborgs, clones, witches, pod racing, a nearly infinite number of varied planets &amp; civilizations.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just this near-perfect storm of everything + the kitchen sink and more where anyone can potentially find something to like! The sheer amount of content (canonical and EU) is so vast now that it literally feels like an entire universe.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I enjoy the Old Republic, the Clone Wars, the Rebels vs. Empire conflict, and the Skywalkers' exploits, those stories are only a few of many. There are countless tales to get immersed in with different writers, styles, and sub-genres.

&amp;#x200B;

Even today, there are places, time periods, and possibilities not yet explored. THAT'S what keeps me invested in *SW* most, not the stories, characters, or events but this extraordinary creative playground of possibility in which it all happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, it will be sad when the Skywalker saga ends and characters we grew up with leave for good. But that's okay because, where one journey ends, another can always begin somewhere else. That's the beautiful, accidental genius of it!

&amp;#x200B;

I say ""accidental"" in that, however much Lucas truly did or didn't plan ahead with his wealth of ideas &amp; influences, he never could've predicted how much this mythos would grow, be added to, and bring so many different people together.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the greatest strength of storytelling! Every franchise has peaks and valleys, and *SW* will never be an exception. But one could argue that that's part of what makes it interesting. That's exactly what *SW* is as a story &amp; brand. It ENDURES.

&amp;#x200B;

It gives different generations a chance to get to know the universe, fall in love with it all over again for new reasons, and open doors for new creators to contribute something. They may not all be successful, original, or equally talented.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, failure cannot stop imagination. It can only ever delay it. So long as even one person cares about *SW*, it will NEVER fully die even if the films someday end. As an artist, writer, and film enthusiast myself, I respect &amp; admire that.

622,Is there even a point to continue following SW anymore (regarding EU becoming legends)?,"Let me start by saying I’ve been a fan since I was a kid and I absolutely love episodes 1-6, and I’m totally cool with people liking the newer movies. I guess you can say I’m a casual fan though cause I only recently found out about the EU. I started to read up on it out of curiosity and I find out that it was rebranded as Legends and is no longer canon. But some videos I watched on YouTube insisted that it’s all consistent and can still be considered canon.

So I make the choice to ignore the fact that it’s no longer canon and decide I want to dive into the EU. I saw that the thrawn trilogy was recommended by basically everyone as a starting point for those who want to get into the EU so I recently started reading heir to the empire. Then I find out about Han and Leia’s kids according to legends and stopped reading immediately. I now feel like I’m at a crossroads (which I never realized even existed until recently).

It’s just not possible to ignore the inconsistency in the Solo ancestry (despite the similarities between Ben and Jacen). And honestly, learning that Disney took everything in a completely different direction kind of ruined the interest I started to have a week ago.

I dont know what to do now. I feel like if I continue to get into the EU, I’m just lying to myself because none of it really matters anymore. It doesnt seem like it’s supposed to be legitimate anymore. I’d have to keep that in the back of my mind as I read anything going forward, so there’s really no point. 

Or, I can continue exploring the EU but I’d have to ignore anything that comes out in theaters in the future. Either way, I feel I need to let something go now, which sucks (guess I’m late to the party, lol).

Star Wars is starting to not feel legitimate anymore. There’s a completely split that I wasnt even aware of until recently (cause I’m a noob I guess). What’s the point now?

635,Rogue One : A Star Wars Stary is the best 'new' best Star Wars movie imo,"So I recently got back into Star Wars Lore and I realized that Rogue One is the new best Star Wars movie out there. I watched the prequel Trilogy back when I was in school and never got to watch the rest. Recently I watched the original Trilogy, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. And I really enjoyed the Original Trilogy. I might watch Solo sooner or later too.

You can tell I'm just a casual fan. While watching Force Awakens I realised how nostalgic that movie is for all the Hardcore Star Wars fans even I got goosebumps Watching Luke Skywalker Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and not to mention Millennium Falcon again but that's all that movie had. To me I felt like that movie is all about nostalgia and nothing special . Rey was charismatic but so was a serius character like Jyn in Rogue One. The single Hallway scene with Darth Vadar was better than what Kylo Ren brought to the table. Rogue One felt like made by a genuine Star Wars Fan and treated the source material with respect. Not saying Force Awakens didn't respect the soruce material or something  it's just Force Awakens is more like shoehorned nostalgic stuff which you don't realise while watching the movie. Maybe groundedness of Rogue One resonate with me idk but I enjoyed it more than Force Awakens. Obviously if you are super hard core fan nostalgic stuff would elavate your excitement even more but as a casual fan I feel like Rogue One was better.

638,A Real Life Parallel.,"Ok so this just came to me after having done some recent history work. As many of you probably know a lot of the settings and events in star wars are taken from real world events. When I was going through the clone wars I noticed in the episode ""Bounty hunters"" Hondo says towards the end of the episode ""This effort is no longer profitable!""

And then it hit me. Whether intentional or not this reminded me of the ending of the American war of Independence. You have a group being bullied into handing over goods without a say in it. When they are trained to fight they aren't exactly the best but numbers and help from other outside forces in the form of bounty hunters and the jedi get them a win.

In the real life events the revolutionaries were not very good at fighting as they were just normal civilians for the most part. But then the Spanish and French sent a lot of aid and training that helped defeat the British. And another big reason for Britain leaving? It was no longer profitable. If you start having an area of your empire not getting you the best returns on the investment you made, and the workers there are revolting which makes a significant dent in your overall economy, then what's the point in staying there? The far east was much more profitable so better to look there than keep fighting because of your ego.",StarWars,1569756738,Dragnipur47,2,2,True,2019-09-29

**REBELS S2 E16-18 and E20**

- It was really nice to see Hera and her dad reconcile things. Clearly the people of Ryloth have a complicated and unfortunate past. You can see where both of them are coming from, and it’s really nice when they are able to get on that same footing. Family can never really be broken.

- Another interesting thing, is how you can see differing perspectives of rebellion. Planets who would rather fight for their own personal freedom, and those who would rather fight for galactic freedom. It stems from the same principle but is differentiated by perspective. Which I think is a big part of the message in the story.

- Welcome back to Geonosis! And our first hint at the Death Star! Making a whole lot of canon connections. Dating back to AOTC, and of course The Clone Wars.

- We learn a lot more about Kallus, and we have a good look into the humanity of those who work for the Empire. We are used to hating Kallus but here we see he isn’t a terrible person and we see the start of his arc and that’s great.

- Another great duel between Kanan, Ezra and the Inquisitors. Seriously epic. The backdrop is dark and menacing, and the ambiance is just exciting. The Inquisitors definitely make the missions much more difficult.

- Seeing the Holocron recording of Anakin was really cool. You can tell at this time most people didn’t know Anakin was alive, let alone Darth Vader. Anakin had a great reputation and Ashoka never stopped caring for and looking up to her master. Which makes Ashoka’s arc in this season so impactful.

- The stuff at the Lothal temple was amazing. Kanan’s trials, Ezra speaking with Yoda, and then Ashoka learning the truth about Anakin. All while the Inquisitors are encroaching on them and getting closer.

- Kanan fighting the temple guards, and the reveal of the grand Inquisitor was very cool, the way he is Knighted as officially a Jedi Knight. Ezra speaking with Yoda was really cool, getting to see Frank Oz back and hints at what is to come. Seeing Anakin turn into Darth Vader was chilling, and I’m excited to see Ashoka and Anakin’s final encounter in The Clone Wars.

- We’ve got another reference to the discrimination against droids. Chopper tries to buy his leg, and the salesman asks where his owner is. When Chopper says he’s independent, the salesman laughs and says “Independent? A droid?” Which cements the concept that droids aren’t considered their own individuals, but instead must be the property of another being. Then again later we see a captain complaining about AP-5 and saying he can’t wait for it’s replacement to arrive, so they can shuffle him off to the scrap heap. Then Troopers bump into him and don’t even bother to apologize. Later AP-5 even mentions “no one rescues droids.” And that freewill would be nice.

.

661,Why The Last Jedi was my favorite star wars film and I truly believe it was the best in the entire series,"TLJ has split fans a lot and I know this might get an enormous amount of hate. I've seen all the arguments around disliking the movie and can understand them, but I don't agree with them at all. Here is why this film was my favorite in all of Star Wars.

1.) Rey is by far the most interesting, grounded and believable protagonist in all of Star Wars for me. Too often in fantasy settings we see the protagonist have typical characteristics like being naive,prone to mistakes, etc, but then they get their powers and suddenly everything turns around as they rise to become a Hero. Rey is such a realistic approach to what would happen if a young ignorant adult suddenly had powers, that they would just be a young ignorant adult with powers. Although she appears to be strong, she's a confused and uncertain individual who has been thrust into major galactic events that she knows nothing about, and is just trying to make the best of what is likely the most confusing situation possible. Rey feels incredibly authentic to me and not another boring protagonist who figures everything out about what they need to do so fast.

2.) Kylo Ren like Rey is to me the most grounded, believable and fascinating antagonist of the series. He isn't some ""muhahahah"" typical evil and power obsessed villain, he's a confused, angry and conflicted man filled with the potential to do both great good and great harm. The way he and Rey do gravitate towards evil versus good, but often wobble and have the potential to flip, is such a fresh and exciting dynamic for Star Wars that I don't think we've seen enough of. 

3.) General message of the series. I love the sequels and their message that anyone can be a hero. I do enjoy the prophecies in Star Wars as it contributes to the mysteriousness of the force, but it's nice to see a change in that you don't have to be a Skywalker or even a force user in general to be a hero. Something as simple as Rose releasing the captive animals on that casino world and seeing how happy it made her after the death of her sister was such an underrated scene that gets so much hate.

And I often read/hear that RO is the BEST movie since the disney acquisition. I can see why. I can understand it. I just wanted to share why I think differently and tell you all why I like TLJ and what kind of Problems RO has in my opinion. 

For me RO relies too much on well executed fan-service. And borrows A LOT from other material. Not only the movies, for that matter. Many aspects of RO remind me a lot of ROTJ. Talking to a criminal/terrorist on a desert planet who has someone important captive (Bodie/Han) in the beginning of the movie. discussing the attack of the DS with the rebellion (even with mon mothma and the attack beeing held by Raddus/Ackbar). Using an imperial shuttle with probably expired acces codes to sneak on a highly secured planet with a lot of vegetation which is aslo connected to the death star. You see where I am going. What's also kind of odd to me is the over reliance on characters we already now from previous movies and other media. Bail, Mon, Tarkin, Vader, Saw, Leia (kinda). The emotional attachments do not form with the main characters, they are just pre existing  with the previously named. For a one off movie there shouldn't be this many main characters. Jynn, Casian, Chirrut and Baze simply do not have enough character development for me to really care about them. 
Now comes my personal big one. If the BEST most THRILLING scene in the entire movie has NOTHING to do with the main characters (Vader in the hallway) something is not quite right. I still love the scene, but it's kinda sad that THIS scene is the one everybody thinks about when they hear RO and not Galen's sacrifice, or Jynn's arc. Nope it's OP Vader slicing up rebeö scum.

Now to why I really like TLJ. TLJ does the OPPOSITE of RO in terms of legacy characters. In the TLJ Legeacy characters are used to move the new main cast forward, Leia is used to move poe forward and teach him to be a good leader, Luke is used to develop Rey further. The movie also doesn't put them on a ""podest"" to be worhsipped, or to squeeze nostalgia points out of the audience. Especially Luke as a character has been developed the most and different. And he is perfect as he is in the movie. Luke not beeing OP as shit just because he is Luke makes everything he actually does the more meaningfull. Also his death was the perfect death for a Jedi. He bought his friends time by owning Kylo without even fighting, sacrificing himslef in the process. This the perfect iteration of yoda's ""A jedi uses the force for knowledge and attack, never for attack"". Luke, in the end is what a Jedi SHOULD be not the very broken bad Jedi from the prequels. He even states this IN THE MOVIE.

The movie also has a theme which I didn't really see in RO. 
Inbefore someone comments ""Why do you say Luke shouldn't be OP when Rey Is a MaRy SuE""

I have seen every star wars movie probably like 50-100 times each over my lifetime. And I personally do not see a big difference between Rey's ""learning curve/ability"" and Luke's Rey is even more entitled to learn it this quick than Luke. Let me explain. The first I always hear is ""She had no training"", well how much training did Luke have in the force and fighting, luke could use the force without any training at the beginning of ESB and what does he later learn? Lifting some rocks.  Now if you pay close attention to what Yoda teaches him it is clear that the ONLY limitation to a force wielders power is his will/what he belives is possible. Before meeting Obi wan Luke had NO idea what the force even is and until yoda pulls the X-Wing out of the swamp Luke doesn't belive it could even be done. ""I don't believe it"" ""That, is why you fail"". So Luke has only done some running and flipping and knows he can ""potentially"" lift big things with the force. What does he do next, he confronts vader, gets his ass kicked and falls down a hole. The next time we see him he already mastered lightsaber combat, can use the force fluently and is pretty much a full jedi. But he didn't train with yoda after bespin. He had NO lightsaber training what so ever, or did he train off screen. Same applies to his sudden mastery of the force. 

Now regarding Rey, there is ONE key difference between Rey and Luke. Rey has previous experience. She is also very gullible which is a flaw but helps witht he force. Rey knows stories about the Jedi, Luke and the force mainly stuff like making things float, midn control and those tricks. She was also FORCED TO LIVE ON A DESERT PLANET AT A VERY YOUNG AGE HAVING TO DEFEND HERSELF. If Rey wouldn't be experienced in combat she would have been dead. The mindtrick scene often comes up when her ""mary sueness"" is discussed. Here is her obvious gullibility come into play.Since she recently discovered the force is real and she can probably use it. So what does she do in a situation like beeing captive? She could try to use the mindtrick  she heard about in the stories. She even struggles to do it. But manages to do it in a dire situation. If someone has a problem with her beeing able to fly the falcon, look at anakin in TPM, but bear in mind, Rey is older, and spent her entire life disassembeling old ships from the same era as the falcon. She knowing how it works and beeing able to fly it is perfectly plausible. 

But before I get too much off the rails. I am gonna end this post.",StarWars,1569785112,kyle-ron,77,0,True,2019-09-29
671,"Open discussion, favorite SW movie","So, a common hot take, I know, but I really can’t finish to say how much I love this movie.

Bear with me, I didn’t say it is the BEST movie in the saga, I would give that title to Empire Strikes Back, but definetly this movie is up there, not only because it is the instant prequel of A New Hope, but because it is probably the best Star Wars produced media Disney have done to this day.

I may start talking a little about the plot, so be warned of spoilers, if anyone hasn’t seen it, do yourselves a favor and see this masterpiece.

So, I feel this may become my ode to a film I love so much. I simply love it because everything in the story is so perfectly crafted. For instance, Disney has a reputation of sometimes adding too much comic relief moments in their movies, something I criticize the new sequels of doing either too much or out of place, killing the vibe of being a Star Wars film, and leaving me more of a MCU taste when I see them. Even though, still talking about the sequels trilogy, they still do things I loved, and one of my favorite things is how underrated Kylo Ren is by some people, mainly how complex he is in his inner struggle and how they show his rage in his character, even in how they designed his lightsaber and its backstory.

But well, going back to Rogue One, I love every character because they present their individual purposes without under or overexplaining them. Everyone has their one mindsets, that in storytelling may be completely different, but when put together on the plot has an incredible chemistry that doesn’t fall into the “we’re on the same team just because we found each other” simple stereotype. I love how they represented how a team of people with completely different backgrounds became the seed of the Resistance than ended up winning on the original trilogy.

Apart from that, the visuals are breathtaking, maybe the best of all the new movies. What the visual effects team did to resurrect Peter Cushing and  Carrie Fisher as Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia is stunning, the first time I saw the film I went out of the cinema asking myself how did they do it. Everything about the visuals of the movie is an piece of art.

My favorite part of the film is probably the Vader Rage corridor scene. Again, probably not a surprise to anyone, but I realized that Disney gave us the fans something we wanted so long ago. In general Darth Vader’s appearance in the movie was implemented to perfection, not forcing his appearance as a cashgrab for marketing, but as pure fan service. He appears more as a cameo than a principal part of the plot, which lets him keep this aura of mystery and fear in the character. But the scene itself brings the best of both the original trilogy and the prequels, keeping this aura of mystery and fear into Vader, but adding Anakin’s rage into the character, something that lacked in the original trilogy because of the effects/facilities disposed on that time. What they did with roughly 15 minutes of screen time, did astounding things in Darth Vader’s mythos that we only thought we would only see on books, comics or fan-made material.

I could keep writing about how passionate I am with this movie, but it would take me a lot of time, and I hope some others share their views, maybe show others which of the movies is their favorite, as I showed today.",StarWars,1569785228,NoLootboxesPlz,0,1,True,2019-09-29

685,Best Variant of the Soundtracks,"One of the best ways for me to enjoy Star Wars is simply by listening to the soundtracks. The prequel, and the OG soundtracks are without a double my favorites. The issue is that I’m having a very hard time finding a good quality version of these soundtracks.

Tidal &amp; YouTube both have the remastered versions, and I noticed they were littered with mid/high frequency noise. So I went ahead and purchased Ep. 1-6 remastered on CD’s (ripped to FLAC) and found that it still contains the same noise issue.

I was able to clean up all the songs to an extent with audacity by removing that specific waveform. The issue is that waveform is often times somewhat included with the higher pitches acoustics, like violins, etc... While the sound is VERY clean as opposed to before, I found that some of the acoustical instruments lost some information on the top end. It works, but it’s not what I would like it to be.

Can anyone out there recommend a good source to purchase a “cleaner” version of the soundstracks? If it’s just the prequel trilogy, that is fine with me as it is most affected by it.

That would’ve actually been a smart subversion of our expectations, because it’d feature Luke Skywalker, the guy who saw the good in his space nazi dad, learn that not everyone can be turned from the dark. Some people are just fucked up for no real reason.

687,100 Day Star Wars Challenge September 29th - Rebels (Twilight of the Apprentice),"Day 18 brings us the end of Rebels season 2! I’ve been really looking forward to this!

.

**Twilight of the Apprentice**

- Ashoka and Rex’s friendship is really sweet. They have been through so much together and it was really nice to see that call back to when Ashoka was first introduced.

- The Sith temple and battlefield was super cool. The structure and surrounding area has such an ominous design and I think ancient Sith and Jedi lore is some of the coolest stuff explored in this show. I especially love that it teases the cross-guard lightsaber design that Kylo Ren uses.

- Maul is back! This guy just really refuses to die lol. But honestly it’s so interesting to see him again and especially the way they introduce him. He seems weak, and sincere, and you know you shouldn’t trust him but there’s a moment where Maul and Ezra share the same pain. 

- The Sith Holocron stuff was epic, in fact the whole battle leading up the temple was insane. The duels were great, and the way Maul was temping Ezra with the dark side the whole time was really exciting. When Maul killed the Inquisitor I was really blown away. This whole sequence was incredibly intense.

- When Maul goes from helping them to blinding Kanan and you get a hint of Duel of Fates, chills for days. I love Maul! You know you can’t trust him throughout the episode, yet he keeps acting like maybe you can. Then all of a sudden he’s back to his old ways yet somehow it’s still a shocker.

- Hearing Ventress’s voice from the Holocron was chilling. But Vader showing up on top of his TIE fighter was AMAZING! Like, literal chills. Ashoka and Vader was intense. And when Ashoka says “I am no Jedi.”, again, CHILLS.

- When she slices through part of his armour, and you can see part of his face, and you hear Anakin’s voice and Vader’s voice at the same time, it’s jaw dropping. Probably one of the best moments in the whole saga. Even though we know Ashoka lives, when she sacrifices herself it’s moving. But even more so when Kanan and Ezra get back to base and he and Rex share an emotion look, and Rex knows she’s gone.

- The ending sequence, with that music, and Vader limping away from the temple. Showing everyone and ending on Ezra opening the Holocron: EPIC. Like this is probably the most mind blowing and moving sequence from the whole show thus far so it hits home as a season finale.

694,Triple Force Friday is the most disappointing one yet :(,"First off let’s start with the fact no stores are opening for midnight because of this.

Back with Episode I it was so exciting, I was 10 at the time. I loved going out for all the big new launches, but now there’s no fanfare. Target’s ad has a small corner of a page and also announces in the bubble about Frozen 2 merch.

Hasbro has their least amount of products yet. Their basic 3.75 line is dead in lieu of TVC, one of which figures is X-wing Luke for zero reason with 3 other new things to focus on. Their gold 2-packs also make no sense, why not wait til the 50th for those? They’re also releasing a Galaxy of Heroes line of 5in kids figures that look like Disney Infinity or the Disney Toybox line, neither of which did too well.

I know part of these changes is due to lackluster sales since TFA, but a BIG part of it was no consistency in product launches.

Some examples:
-Disney had die-cast Elite figures for TFA &amp; R1 that were basically identical to Hasbro Black Series, to the exact detail and price. Why?
-Hasbro rereleased many Black Series figures several times, guaranteeing they’d rot on shelves and hit clearance. R1 Jyn was way overproduced.
-Hasbro rereleased many 3.75 figures that didn’t sell from R1 in their Solo line with updated Force Link chips, versus giving just new Solo figs. Additionally, their TFA line S1 for a whole new trilogy had Vader and Luke, proving they can’t let go of the OT. Those figures also had weird accessories that weren’t in the movie and deluxe figures again with weird weapons not from the movie.

I think a big part too is many kids aren’t getting into action figures as much and would rather buy Funko or just had digital games/content. This is why Hasbro is focusing on higher price point TVC and Black Series.

Funko is also out of ideas as well, with many recent releases just being chrome color variants and jumbo versions of previous characters. However, they have a lot more character variety for the three new releases than any other company.

695,A new hope for those that hate The Force Awakens,"I remember feeling so disappointed after watching The Force Awakens for the first time. I’m a moderate-serious fan of the Star Wars canon established in the novels so I as I sat down to watch TFA, I was nervous about how they’d integrate these new movies into that universe. On my first go through, I enjoyed the cheap nostalgia but got annoyed by all the “coincidences” + perfect timing in this movie. I was even more annoyed at the First Order and Starkiller Base trying to be a bigger/semi-badder/extremely cliché new age Imperials. But mostly I was complete turned off by the decision to break from canon.

Fast forward - after watching Rogue One, The Last Jedi, Solo, and visiting Galaxy’s Edge in Orlando, I gave myself some time to reflect. I understand now how the First Order came to be and why the Resistance isn’t the combined forces of the New Republic. So I rewatched TFA and absolutely loved it! It’s acting packed story in crammed into 2 hrs, hitting so many major points that I now understand why they had to jam it in like they did. The story fits quite well into the universe that Lucas created and while I’m still bummed about diverging from canon, I see now how they can still bring in the Thrawn or Rogue Squadron sagas in all their glory. I initially felt that TFA was an outlier and was just about Disney wanting to be different/sell more merchandise but now I see it as a great connector of so many storylines, opening up the Star Wars universe to numerous new adventures. 

I still like Rogue One the most out of the new movies but if you’re sitting there not a fan of TFA - try looking at it with an open mind and I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised.",StarWars,1569808371,DrCapeBreton,15,5,True,2019-09-29

717,"George didn't like The Force Awakens because ""there was nothing new"" presented in it technologically or visually. Rogue One and Solo are guilty of this too.","I feel the same way about every single Disney Star Wars movie, besides The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi is perhaps the only Disney Star Wars movie where the director felt the freedom to do his own thing and had the balls to also carry it out. The Force Awakens was quite simply 100% of a movie made to cater to people who disliked the prequels and just wanted a verbatim beat for beat repeat of the OT. But Rian Johnson has said ""there as something really beautiful about the prequels"". What are some of those big hitting 'critiques' of the prequels? ""The writing is terrible"" when the writing was done with clear purpose and theatricality in mind, sounds exactly like the stuff Star wars fans are now repeating about The Last Jedi. 

Rogue One was full of nostalgia bait just like Solo and both are prequels expanding on lore from the OT while adding absolutely nothing original on their own. The biggest original thing in Rogue One is Scarif being a tropical looking planet with beaches. That's it. 

What disheartens me is I see Star Wars fans trashing The Last Jedi so often, yet defending Rogue One and even Solo when they were completely reshot messes that were attempting to just milk Star Wars fans of their money for appealing to the original trilogy aesthetic while having none of the charm. 

The original aspects of Solo? The terribly low lit sets and Emilia Clarke being shoved in our faces again and killing the bad guy who is about 2 feet taller than as Han Solo cowers in fear. How could anyone even think that was a good Star Wars movie or a good idea? 

The Force Awakens, Rogue One and Solo also are all written and executed like they are trying to be safe and inoffensive, there is nothing more offensive. The Last Jedi actually split the fandom, it made people go crazy because like the prequels because it showcased atypical style dialogue, writing and visuals. It was more ambitious than the other three movies by a landslide.

And now we have Episode IX coming out and most of the footage looks like it's trying to just remake Return of the Jedi, even Palpatine is back. And we also have Mandalorian, which looks terrible and soulless, yet everyone sees a shiny Boba Fett lookalike helmet and immediately lowers their standards and starts to act like it's something amazing, when it's looks like bland, uninteresting show with OT Star Wars paint slapped on it. 

I think Star Wars fans really need to stop hindering the artistic creation in their own series, because essentially they have trashed George Lucas and Rian Johnson. And then they wonder why many filmmakers who might be great don't even want to touch the fandom and franchise. It's because Star Wars fans deep down don't want anything new and can't think outside the box.",StarWars,1569834006,kaminoplayer,37,0,True,2019-09-30
718,An overdue theory but better late than never.,"So after seeing the second trailer for the Rise of Skywalker I had an idea. I have no idea if this has already been discussed but I wanted to get this out there.

I don’t believe Palpatine ever intended on having an apprentice. I think in the Prequels he had planned on turning Anakin to the dark side in order to use him to sustain himself ( draining his power to achieve immortality) I know it seems weird but stick with it.

It’s theorised that Plagueis created Anakin. And Palpatine has already mentioned that Plagueis knew the secret to cheating death. 

I believe that Plagueis created Anakin as a means of draining his power to become immortal. But was killed by Palpatine before he was able to. And before Palpatine had the chance to attempt the same thing, Anakin was dismembered by Obi Wan, weakening his connection to the force. And So he just used him as his enforcer.

In the years during the Galactic Empire I believe that the Emperor built laboratories (observatories) that allowed him to create a new life, similar to Plagueis. And following the emperors “death” one of these observatories located on Jakku were activated, creating Rey. And I believe that Palpatine intends to drain Rey of her power in order to “resurrect” himself or to gain immortality in order to rule over his new Sith Empire. But before he can do so, she must be turned to the dark side, like with Anakin.

Again this my personal idea of what could happen and how it could link all 9 films. There are things this doesn’t answer and no doubt it’ll get picked apart but I thought this was an interesting idea. 🙂

I’d be interested to hear what you guys think. Xx

755,Kylo Ren was the hero all along. And his plan has always been to find and kill the emperor.,"In the Star Wars Dark Empire comics there is a storyline about how Luke goes to the dark side so that he can learn how to defeat it, and get close to the emperor in order to kill him. I think that Kylo Rens story borrows this idea.

When Snoke begins manipulating Kylo while he is in training with Luke, Kylo is aware of it. And when Luke comes for him in the middle of the night, Kylo realizes the time is right to put his plan into motion. His first act is to destroy the Jedi temple that Luke built, and then give himself over to the dark side. 
But Snoke is not his target. Kylo knows that the Emperor is still out there. So he must bide his time and play the role of the dark Jedi, all in hopes of eventually finding and getting close to the Emperor, who is always watching him. Killing his father, Han Solo, is just a tactic to fool the emperor. Which is why he is so torn about it, but he knows it must be done to make the charade complete. 

Similarly, killing Snoke is all part of the plan. He had to wait until just the right moment to make it convincing. With Snoke gone, and Kylo proving himself as a true disciple of the Sith, the Emperor will return to take his place on the throne, with Kylo by his side. 

When Kylo swears to the deceased Vader ""I will finish what you started,"" he is talking about destroying the Emperor, not about bringing balance to the force.

.

**Rebels S3 E1-3**

- Ezra being tempted by the dark side was really interesting to see, the way in which anger effects people. But also the perspective in which the Bendu takes to explain the light and dark. His way of helping Kanan see a new way was great, and how that is a huge factor in his development as a character.

- The Holocron lore is really cool, and when they joined them together it was awesome. Maul learning about Obi-wan and Ezra being hinted at Luke got me really excited. Hints toward the OT get better and better and this is one of my favourite seasons.

- Seeing a brutal attack on a supply transport shows what lengths of cruelty the Empire is willing go to, but is also a great introduction to a TIE fighter heavy episode and a great look into Imperial Academy cadets.

- I love seeing a bit of an origin story for Wedge! I do hope we get more stories about him set after ROTJ. Seeing him on Rebels is really great, and is again part of that steady progression into the OT. Which is awesome! Sabine and Wedge’s dynamic was really fun too.

781,"Last Jedi fans, was wondering if you could argue with me on the movie on certain points.","I want to start by saying this isn't a shit post or to trigger someone. We all have our opinions and our right to it. And I love certain parts of Last Jedi and hate others. I'm not here to be at someone's throat and am not trying to fuel the fire. I want genuine actual discussion about a movie like people used to do before internet culture ruined everything. 

So for those of you who love Last Jedi, I was wondering how some of you would defend parts of the writing in the film I find flawed but maybe could be convinced otherwise. 

Po is where most of the issue is. He did absolutely nothing wrong in the beginning. The objective was to take out the dreadnaught. Then when Leia realized they were losing she tried to force them to stay back. Po refuses and says they need to take it out now because they may not have the opportunity again. And they do! Casualties sure, but a small price to pay. It's war. And it's important that in the film they state that dreadnaught being left alive would've have pretty much guaranteed the death of what's left of the resistance easily. He just saved everyone. Then Leia actually scolds him. His decision led to everyone being alive, Leia's decision almost certainly would've doomed everyone. She's a bad general. 

Then Holdo. She withheld information from the best soldier she's got. Even if he got demoted by Leia it's just ridiculous. They're in such a desperate situation with so little in terms of members of the resistance left there's no way it is worth turning what little left you got away. But fine then we get to the mutiny. And she still holds back information. Over her stupid sense of pride and lack of respect for the guy who saved everyone. The resistance cannot afford a mutiny or any delays in such a desperate situation. It blows my mind she let it happen and continue to happen and couldn't try to fix it in a more direct way. Her decision led to the actions of Finn and Rose which screws more up. And you may say this is just a lesson about failure. But clearly by the directing of the movie the failure is meant to be on Po's part. But he was the only one doing what's right. He saved everyone and didn't blindly follow orders like he's part of the Empire. The film wants us to believe we should think Holdo and Leia were who we should side with who unironically believe the resistance members should withhold information and scold war heroes who saved everyone. 

How would you guys defend this? I just can't believe the storytelling genuinely is trying to make the viewers see Po's actions as wrong and trigger happy and that Holdo and Leia came out as the wise ones.",StarWars,1567051286,inFINN1te,120,1,True,2019-08-29

Sorry, this is not true. On the bright side, you did find an incredible movie if you came across a Star Wars VHS. So let's clear the air. 

**Are my Star Wars VHS tapes rare?**

For the most part, none of your Star Wars VHS tapes of the saga films are rare. Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 4, Episode 5 and Episode 6 were all released in North America. They're among some of the most popular movies of all time and more than enough copies were circulated to meet that demand. 

 Episode 3 had a small release on VHS in PAL regions and copies of that can go for a 100 bucks. So in the instance you're in a place like New Zealand and you find a copy of Revenge of the Sith on VHS, congratulations! You found a rare Star Wars VHS. If you are in North America and you see a copy of ROTS on VHS, it's most likely a bootleg which I guess could be considered rare. 

Spin off material like the Ewok films and VHS tapes of Star Wars cartoons like Droids can be considered rather uncommon however. 

**""My Star Wars VHS tapes are the versions without the changes! They must be rare""**

If you value watching Star Wars without any of the 1997 additions, then great! You now have an official way to watch the closest thing to the original theatrical release. But sorry, these aren't rare either. If you have a copy of the original trilogy with a red corner label that says ""Hi-Fi"" you have found the first widespread Star Wars VHS releases. While these may go for an extra fews dollars on sites like eBay, most thrift stores will still just toss these off for 50 cents or a buck. They are not rare either. Cool find though! 

**""My copy of the original Star Wars comes in a clamshell case and says Video Rental Library on it""**

Here ya go. If you find a copy of this, then you can say you have found something on the rare side regarding Star Wars VHS tapes. Back in the early 80s, VHS tapes were more of a luxurious item to own so most homes had to rent a VCR and a VHS tape and even then, this could be pretty pricey. The 1982 Video Rental Library VHS of Star Wars was never meant to officially be sold. It was for rental only; however, it was only a matter of time before a few copies of these snuck off the shelves. They are marked by a serial number, both on the clamshell case and the tape itself. If these numbers match, that means the tape belongs to its original case and the value just went up for it to be about 70-80 bucks. Without a matching serial code, you're looking at about 50 bucks.",StarWars,1567072465,themanoftin,24,73,True,2019-08-29

And it just kind of makes sense. What if a some sort of future insurance plans against the Sith, Obi-Wan had actually cloned shmi at Kamino and then leff her on Jakku as a small child and then he went back to tattooine an eventually trained to Luke shortly thereafter.

This would make a lot of sense as during the force awakens scene where Rey has a vision/flashback when she sees Luke's sabre, You can clearly hear Obi-Wan calling out her name and saying ""these are your first steps"", And then in the last Jedi you see her flashback where she's in a hall of mirrors of herself which could probably represent clones.

Even visions from the Clone Wars show maintained realistic interpretations of characters such as Yoda when he envisioned that the Clone Wars never transpired, with Dooku's light side self being present. For a unique weapon and attire to be present makes me feel that it isn't a vision.

821,My theory for Rey's origin,"The origin of the charter Rey in the star wars universe is something that has been constantly theorised since the release of TFA and as of yet we are still unsure of who she truly is. In TLJ Kylo Ren States that her parents were simply no one ""drifters"" and she is not from any significant family line and while I personally like this origin and think it is a semi interesting twist many do believe this is true and it is still fun to theorise. So here is a short summary of my theory and then a longer explination with some compelling evidence: 

I believe Rey is a clone of Luke Skywalker created by Darth Sidious

Ok so let's start with the evidence in TFA:
Rey has an obvious connection to the character of Luke Skywalker, she is a naturally gifted pilot, she feels a connection to his lightsabre, she is able to confidently use the force and a lightsabre with very minimal training much like Luke and narratively she shares similarities such as growing up on desert planet, not knowing the identity of her parents and escaping the desert planet with a former empire/first order soldier on the millennium falcon the destroy a planet killing weapon. After TFA's release it was (for obvious reasons) very heavily theorised that Rey was Luke's daughter, however, learning if his whereabouts between episode VI and episode VIII somewhat proves this wrong and it seems to obvious form a writing perspective.

Evidence from TLJ:
When Rey is training on Ach-To she instantly feels a call to the dark side of the island suggesting that this is her ""natural calling"" which could support the potential fact the palatine created her as a clone of Luke as a dark side weapon (I will get into this more later). In TLJ Rey and Kylo's connection is explored which is then later revealed to be because Snoke connected them but it is obvious there is more there. This could be due to their (somewhat) relation through the Skywalker bloodline. Lastly what I think is the most compelling evidence is this: when Rey goes to the mirror on the island on Ach-To and asks who her parents are she sees a long, seemingly infinate line of herself. I think this really supports the idea that she could be a clone and possibly that there are multiple copies of her.

Evidence from ROS trailer:
At the end of the second ROS trailer we see Rey holding a (frankly dope) foldable, double sided RED lightsabre, suggesting a turn to the dark side. However I believe that this is not Rey but simply a successful clone. Mostly because the whole journey of Rey's character in this trilogy has been about her being able to reject the dark side and to be the hero of the franchise. Therefore I don't think it has been set up enough for her to turn in the last movie with no set up. I also think this could be a clone because just before she is shown we hear the distinct breath of Darth Vader suggesting that he may return but also envoking a similarity between Anakin and Rey. As well as a shared DNA to me this could suggest that this Rey was a weapon created and corrupted by palatine and used to become the ultimate weapon for his army. This really reflects the first half of Anakin's character ark. As well as this the title: ""Rise of Skywalker"" could suggest the rising up of an individual or even army of clones within the Skywalker bloodline. 

What I think could be the full story:
In ROTJ palatine and his entire army is defeated by the rebellion and Luke Skywalker. He somehow survives Anakin's attack on him and slowly starts to rebuild the empire. He realises that the best way to do this is to clone the one person who was able to take down his ultimate empire and uses Luke's hand, which he could have easily gained at some point after ESB and he uses this to attempt to clone Luke with technology he has left from his rule of the Republic. However, one of the clones is defective (we know clones can be due to 99 in clone wars) and escapes or is rescued and grows up on Jakku as Rey, however palatine continues to attempt to create his perfect dark side weapon from the DNA of Luke Skywalker and the ""Rey"" we see at the end of the ROS trailer rises as Palpatine returns to take over the galaxy. 

This is just my idea of a potential reveal in ROS, I'm not saying u think this is definite or even the best ending for the Skywalker saga but it interesting to think about.",StarWars,1567090655,Lantern_Rayner42,26,0,True,2019-08-29
822,[Essay] How the First Order came to be,"http://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2019/08/star-wars-essay-how-first-order-came-to.html

I'm a huge fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, whether it is the classic Legends or the new canon version. I bought my first adult novel when I was twelve in Dark Force Rising by Timothy Zahn and eventually read literally hundreds of the books. I'm not against the reboot because I think they covered literally everything they possibly could with the classic trio up to Crucible by Troy Denning. 

However, there are some issues with world-building as we don't know much about the new villains in The First Order or how they came to be. At least on screen. Thankfully, the Expanded Universe is always there to fill in the gaps as long as you're willing to shell out the money necessary to fill in the gaps.

We're still learning a lot of things about the First Order, their methods, and their origins but I think we can build a rough timeline of events from the Battle of Endor to the destruction of Hosnian Prime that ticks off the Second Galactic Civil War. This is a very nerdy series of speculations but I am, in fact, a huge nerd. I hope you guys enjoy.

[b]THE RISE OF THE FIRST ORDER (4 After the Battle of Yavin to 34 After the Battle of Yavin)[/b]

The death of Emperor Sheev Palpatine was part of a one-two punch that caused the rapid disintegration of the Galactic Empire. The other part being the destruction of the Second Death Star and all of the resources that had been devoted to it. The Empire's aura of invincibility had been punctured by the events of the Battle of Yavin but it was utterly destroyed by the Battle of Endor. The Empire, much like in Legends, was not meant to survive Palpatine's death and the only person who could save it, Darth Vader, was redeemed by the love of his son.

Emperor Palpatine had some sort of plan to follow-up his death. The details of which remain nebulous. This was called the Contingency and was implemented by a mixture of droids and hand-picked agents. Originally, I was of the view that it was just meant to be a ""kark you"" to the galaxy and presumably Darth Vader since I'm inclined to think that Palpatine assumed if he was ever killed then it would be at the hands of his apprentice. Since then, it has been shown to be a much-more complicated and intricate plan involving the creation of the First Order. It's possible, depending on the events of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker that it may include Palpatine's resurrection but we'll have to see about that when it comes.

Phase One of the Contingency was was Operation: Cinder with red robed Sentinel droids seeking out the most die-hard fanatics of the Empire to implement the Contingency. These include Admiral Versio, Moff Raythe, and so on. Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, a defacto Emperor's Hand if there ever was one, had a different role in this. Operation: Cinder involved weather-altering satellites to be placed in the orbit of thousands of worlds that would eventually cook the population of the planets' alive. Planets targeted included Naboo, Vardos, Burnin Konn, Candovant, Abednedo, Commenor, Nacronis, and other worlds. No attempt was made to differentiate the loyal from the treasonous: both were equally guilty in the eyes of the Emperor.

The Contingency was carried out with the purpose of making sure the Empire is destroyed as punishment for its failure to protect Palpatine and to make sure no one else takes over the Empire after his death. The perpetrators of the attack don't believe they're destroying the galaxy for no reason but accept on blind faith that this is all part of a cunning master plan to restore the Empire. They're delusional fanatics but that's why they're chosen. The perpetrators, however, generally accepted that there was a greater plan at work and the atrocities were necessary to intimidate the public into submission. It was meant to be a show of strength that forced the galaxy to its knees but had the opposite effect of making it clear there was no redeeming the Empire. If loyalty and submission earned the same death as treason then treason was the only rational path.

Operation: Cinder backfired tremendously to the delusional fanatics' goal. As we see with the events of Alphabet Squadron, the twin punches of Alderaan's destruction and the Battle of Endor heavily hurt the Empire but it wasn't until this that all but the most fanatical Imperials saw the true horrific face of the regime. The Rebellion also helped save many worlds, winning a lot of badly needed publicity. This is exactly as Palpatine planned. This also has the effect of rapidly increasing the size of the New Republic military as millions of defectors are put to work against their former comrades. The rapid re-stablishment of the Republic Senate on Chandrilla also lent the New Republic a legitimacy it did not possess in Legends until the fall of Coruscant.

The Empire's regent during this time was Mas Amedda but he was swiftly put under house arrest by the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB). The ISB was secretly under the control of Gallius Rax who used his assassins, codes, connections, and more to eliminate potential successors to Palpatine. Rax also used Admiral Sloane as a figurehead Grand Admiral to rally the military's remnants around. Contrary to some people's statements, was hardly a puppet as she does a lot of diplomacy and gathering of Imperial forces as we see in Aftermath.

Galliux Rax prevented the NR and Empire's remnant making peace with a terrorist bombing plan aimed at the New Republic Senate under a flag of truce.He also covertly seized control over the entire Empire under the title of Counselor. He gathered the bulk of the Imperial fleet at the backwater planet of Jakku, his home planet, while planning to destroy the world in a cataclysmic explosion that would eradicate both the Empire as well as New Republic. Instead, he was assassinated by Grand Admiral Sloane and the New Republic eradicated the Empire's forces in a lengthy battle. Grand Admiral Sloane escaped on the Emperor's yacht with Brendol Hux, a handful of child soldiers, and the coordinates for the Emperor's flagship the Eclipse. Palpatine had the plan to ""purge"" the Empire of all weakness and have only the most diehard fanatics gather at the Eclipse flagship in the Unknown Regions.

Sloane's intentions were to build a bigger, better, and stronger empire. While her Grand Admiral status is questionable, she certainly was a senior officer and in a good position to found the First Order. My inclination was that she did so and, being a fascist, immediately doubled down on all the Empire's worst qualities with child soldiers replacing clonetroopers as well as Stormtroopers. It may have been Palpatine's will to create the First Order but it was Sloane's insights as well as decisions that created the military junta that would become the basis for Star Wars' version of HYDRA. 

Mas Amedda was then used by the New Republic to formally surrender the Empire under the terms of the Galactic Concordact. With most of the Empire's soldiers having defectors, the surviving officers are declared war criminals, conditional pardons are made for non-combatants, and higher ranked members are put on trial. While Grand Moff Randd escapes Jakku with his fleet and there are insane events like a pirate fleet with a Super Star Destroyer, the Galactic Civil War is for all intents and purposes over.

Mon Mothma promptly demobilized the New Republic military. Given the New Republic military was now mostly ex-Imperials, this made more sense than perhaps was initially apparent. The Military Disarmament Act was implemented a month after the final victory in Jakku, dramatically reducing the New Republic military's size. Princess Leia opposed this act but finds herself overruled. The New Republic then settled into a period of military stability but political instability as the conflict over whether a strong federal government (headed by the Centrist party) vs. a weak one (Populists) began.

Meanwhile, in the First Order, the organization began its rebuilding of the Empire's might under a new name. They made extensive contact with fringe slavers and begin purchasing massive numbers of human children for training as operatives. Protectorate Gleb oversees this as well as the mass looting of Unknown Region worlds of resources. This is referred to as Operation: Resurrection and goes largely unseen by the rest of the galaxy. Given that Protectorate Gleb was recruited by Inferno Squad during Operation: Cinder, that means the Contingency always included a plan to educate a new generation of fanatics. They also loot whole planets of resources. At some point Snoke, perhaps working for the real Palpatine, seized power in the First Order and became its Supreme Leader.

The First Order trained its armies of children before turning them into Stormtroopers, Naval officers, and spies. They proceed to start sending out their agents into the galaxy as a whole. These people like Lady Carise start contacting Imperial Remnants and recruiting some while positioning others. They also begin infiltrating the Centrists and subverting them to their own purposes with moderates like Senator Casterfo eventually purged.

The First Order conquered numerous planets in the Unknown Regions and hollows out planets as well as exterminates whole resources in preparation to create Starkiller Base. Most of what we've seen is less interested in holding planetary populations than gathering resources to build up their fleet to conquer the New Republic. We do see mining facilities and other signs there's a civilian population of the First Order. Not many signs of them but enough to know they exist.

 Rather than use the Eclipse, Snoke constructed the Supremacy to be the FO's mobile capital. They also use kyber crystals in their star destroyers, possibly from a hollowed-out Illum, that makes their weapons almost unstoppable. Kyber crystal-based weapons are put into many of their new and improved brands of Star Destroyers that would violate any treaties the Republic had with the former Empire, were they aware of the First Order's existence.

The Centrists successfully seceded from the New Republic with their new laws. However, it's not actually a very large secession. Maybe about eight or nine Sectors worth, enough that it's a big deal but not the end of the New Republic or beginning of the end. Leia's actions may have prevented that from happening. The ""public"" First Order is presumably swiftly conquered by the actual First Order. Previously, the Republic was unaware of the First Order as it is a ""secret"" organization as of Bloodline. This is 28 ABY and fairly close to the timeline of The Force Awakens, meaning the public First Order is a fairly recent creation.

Despite not being Imperials, the First Order is forced to sign the Galactic Concordact. We get some hints in the short stories the First Order has a lot of credits to spend and use them to buy new technology, buy Senators' allegiance, and keep up with the advance of galactic technology. Snoke made a move to recruit Ben Solo and successfully seduced him to the Dark Side with Luke debating killing him only for Ben to interpret it as an actual assassination attempt.

Princess Leia, disgraced as a politician by the revelation of her parentage, formed the Resistance against the First Order. She has no idea how large or how dangerous the First Order is, only that it is extremely dangerous. The New Republic covertly supports it as both the opening crawl and General Hux both state it. Many NR forces are allowed to join up without losing their ranks. As a deniable asset, though, it fails because the First Order plans to conquer the galaxy. They even begin covert operations to take fueling depots like the Colossus and invade independent worlds. It is only the possible arrival of Luke Skywalker that triggers their final plan, though.",StarWars,1567090674,CT_Phipps,0,1,True,2019-08-29

828,Difference With Vader and Kylo,"This isn't a bashing Kylo thread but more of a look into why Vader is generally more liked. I think it primarily stems from the fact that we have some level of sympathy for Vader's story.

He was a slave for most of his childhood, and then when he was freed by people that were considered mythical to most in the galaxy, he had to leave his mother behind. Add on top of that that he is immediatly thrust into a war and has a body count in the hundreds before he is even a teenager. The Jedi don't even want to take him on initially and it takes Obi-Wan threatening to leave the order for him to recieve training. Then he has to deal with his master (in his eyes) holding him back from his true potential and meeting again the love of his life. Losing his mom to the tusken raiders is where he starts to turn. He thinks he had the chance to save her but ends up failing. Fast forward some years, he is known throught the galaxy as one of the most powerful Jedi and the order still treats him like crap. Suffers from more visions of his secret wife w/ their unborn children dying and then being told to get over it by the grandmaster of the order. Its no shock he confided in Palpatine. The last straw is when he finally realises that the Jedi and Sith are almost identical when Mace says ""He's too dangerous to be left alive"". (Palpatine says the same thing earlier in the film). He then believes he was the one to kill his wife and children in an effort to gain enough power to stop that very thing from happening. His master/bestfriend for most of his life up to that point betrays him and leaves him to die. For 20 years he's saddled with the guilt of his actions only to find out it was all a lie. With his eventual return to the light his story is complete.

Then Kylo. Son to a loving mother and father, not to mention nephew of one of the most legendary people in the galaxy. Whats his motivation? He feels betrayed that no-one told him his grandfather was Vader. With that he fully submits himself to Snoke. Granted he thinks (and is partially right) that Luke wants to kill him but we don't really connect with that because we know Lukes inner thoughts by that point. Plus this was already after he started to accept Snoke so he was on a path of darkness regardless.

The problem here lies with the fact we see Vader as a tragic story and Kylo as only an evil person. But then again thats only my view on it, I'm interested in what others think.",StarWars,1567096773,TheBrown_Streak,0,1,True,2019-08-29

832,"“In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.”","The title is what Yoda says to Obi Wan at the end of Revenge of the Sith; I think this could potentially be a great set up for the Disney+ Obi Wan series. 

Yoda says he will teach Obi Wan how to communicate with Qui Gon Jinn, and Yoda’s first interaction with Obi Wan’s fallen master is shown in one of Yoda’s arcs from the Clone Wars. In the show, Yoda is led to a strange planet by Qui Gonn and has to overcome several trials before he could learn how to become a Force spirit, and these trials could be a good opportunity to reflect on Obi Wan’s struggles if he goes through similar training. 

For one trial, Yoda had to face his own dark side that manifested itself as a shadow version of himself. He was only able to beat this by accepting that the dark side was within him, but he would always have control over it. 

In the second trial, Yoda is brought to an illusion of the Jedi temple where dead Jedi were still alive and Dooku had never turned to the dark side. Yoda rejected Dooku’s invitation to stay and was brought out of the vision after being attacked by his former padawan. 

Yoda has a final trial on Moraband where he faces Darth Sidious with Anakin. Yoda ends up “sacrificing” himself to save Anakin even though it meant losing his chance to find out who Sidious was and preventing what Sidious had in motion for Anakin. 

If Obi Wan goes through similar training in the show, It would be a great opportunity to have him face off with Maul again in a vision without retconning the end of their story in Rebels. Maul could be used to show Obi Wan’s struggle with the dark side since Maul took so much from him.  Duchess Satine could be used for the temptation trial or in the same scenario with Maul. Another way to tempt Obi Wan would be him seeing Anakin and Padme raising Luke and Leia together. 

Seeing Anakin fall to the dark side could be the final trial. Obi Wan could be forced to rewatch events like Anakin slaughtering the Tusken Raiders and preventing Mace from putting an end to Palpatine. Obi Wan would have to see the times he failed Anakin as a brother, and he would ultimately face Vader. Vader could be trying to get to Luke and Leia in this vision, and Obi Wan would only pass the trial by sacrificing himself to prevent this. 

I watched Revenge of the Sith again last night and started thinking about this after hearing Yoda’s final words to Obi Wan. I want to see the more mystical sides of the Force in live action, so I’m really hoping the Obi Wan series goes into his Force spirit training. I think it’s unlikely to happen since they probably wouldn’t want to show Obi Wan leave Luke unguarded. 

I’m pretty sure they’ve said the scripts are finalized for the show, but I just had an idea of what it could possibly entail (it’s more of a wishlist).

837,It's so hard to get excited anymore... Does any one else feel that way?,"To start off, I mean this in the most loving way possible. I adore Star Wars; I always have and I always will. The original trilogy defined my childhood, and those movies are still very special to me. I knew those movies line by line and played every new Star Wars video game that came out. I love/hated (mostly hated) the prequels like every good Star Wars fan, too. When episode VII was announced, I was off-the-wall excited. I counted down the days. I don't think I've ever been as excited for a single movie in my life. And I enjoyed it just fine. It was fine. And it's sequel, episode VIII, was also just fine. They're fine, fun movies, which are just fine.

So don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to hate on the new trilogy. I enjoy those movies quite a bit. But there's just something missing, and since they've come out, I just can't get excited about anything Star Wars related anymore. And there should be so much to get excited about: Episode IX, the new shows on Disney+, even the new Galaxy's Edge theme parks. I just can't care about them anymore. I see an exciting new trailer, and all I can think is, ""meh.""

I'm not sure what exactly is causing this. Maybe I'm underwhelmed by the recent films - I don't hate them by any means, but they've been such a rehash of the originals that I can't quite get invested in them. While I watched the original trilogy 100 times over, I've probably seen episode VIII once, and can't care enough to watch it again. Maybe it hurts to know that my heroes from childhood, Han, Luke, and Leia, are now all gone, eliminated by each new movie one-by-one. And the spin-offs? I couldn't even tell you the plot of ""Solo"", and for me Rogue One was equally forgettable. Perhaps it's the over-saturation of Star Wars, too - the fact that I can't escape a new movie or new TV show or park announcement since Disney's acquisition. Maybe it's just that the excitement in the leadup for episode VII was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and no other movie could possibly match that excitement. Either way, I'm feeling disconnected from Star Wars now, and I can't get excited about the franchise anymore. Even though I desperately wanted to. Again, I don't hate these new movies by any means; I want to love them like I loved the OT. But it's so difficult to care, and I don't know why.

The prequels are so good because they add so much more to, and enhance the experience of the OT simply by existing. Whilst I actually really enjoyed TFA, leading to my Star Wars hype being at an all time high leading up to TLJ, I will never be able to one day look back on TLJ and think, wow, I really see now why this movie makes sense and how it advances the story. Rian Johnson wrote the most absymal Star Wars fan-fic I have ever experienced and assassinated the character of many people's childhood hero. He really did Luke dirty by even insinuating that the one who still saw light in and redeemed Darth Vader would get to the point of, not just thinking for a split second about killing his nephew, but literally igniting his lightsaber and looming over him as he slept. Rian Johnson really displayed his expert craftmanship in writing compelling stories that honour the established lore and convey the personality of 40 year old characters that we know and love by having Luke milk an alien rather than mourn the death of Han. The force projection did Luke dirty as his final onscreen moments with Leia are so much less impactful when he wasn't even there in person. In an effort to make sure out expectations were THOROUGHLY subverted, Rian decided to ignore JJ's leads, threads and obvious character arcs set up for the new trilogy. All this on top of writing a character cringier and more annoying than even Jar Jar's worst scenes, in the form of Rose, and taking us on a good old 40 min rodeo to Canto Shite to add literally nothing to the plot. When there are several compilations available on YouTube of ""The 100 times Mark Hamill tried to warn us about TLJ"" you can see how fundamentally wrong everything Rian Johnson did was. Snoke who? Ackbar who? For what it's worth I love every other aspect of Star Wars and respect when there are some things I like more than others, but TLJ is unforgivable. I do hope Rian's supposed trilogy does turn out to be great and really capture the feel, so long as he does not touch any established characters or eras, give him a blank slate.",StarWars,1567109663,Randomer2016,0,1,True,2019-08-29

866,I think the hidden fleet of star destroyers are much more like Darth Krayt's hidden fleet or that of the Sith Emperor in KOTFE than they are the Katana Fleet.,"The Katana fleet is a much more recognizable fleet from Star Wars history and many people are wondering where and how the Resistance will be able to get enough ships and men to be able to go out and fight the First Order so I can understand why many seem to be connecting the two. However thematically and story wise they are much more like the fleets of two previous sith lords. 

A sith lord rises to power and bides his time in the fringes of the galaxy with the Republic unaware of their existence until they strike out. Their ships blitzing across space and destorying the republic forces. If this sounds familiar its not just because its the plot of the ST but also of Star Wars the Old Republic and Star Wars Legacy (with the added benifit of the Sith co-opting the moff council in Legacy like the FO did to the Centrist party in the NEU) 

All three have that general story in common. And beyond that they have the fact that after each of their Big Bad's are destroyed it is revealed that they were only mostly dead and had survived and returned with a second powerful and hidden fleet. 

In SWTOR and Legacy they attacked their previous followers (for their betrayal and failure) as well as the good guys. We don't know if palpatine will do that yet but we could see a split in factions. Either way that part is pure speculation so lets get back to the similarities. 

So in Legacy War Darth Krayt is seemingly killed by his closest advisor who had been acting as his public face and leading hte sith for him for a long time. He winds up returning with a fleet of entirely new ships, troops and fighters...just like how in TRoS we are seeing new troops, ships, and fighters. 

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/5/5c/Dragonshipsspace.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101218120336

""A Dragon ship was a capital ship that served in the One Sith. Manufactured in secret alongside Emperor Krayt's Annihilator-class starfighters, these ships were unveiled in 138 ABY, when the deposed Krayt returned to Coruscant to reclaim his throne from his ""most trusted"" servant"" Sounds kind of familiar. 

And while we still aren't clear on if the Sith Troopers are a Kylo thing, a palpatine thing, a fleet thing, or what sort of role they will play in the coming movie I think this quote about Dart Krayt's sith troopers is pertinent. "" ""I began this project decades ago, culling those strongest in the Force shortly after their births... Augmenting and improving them... Forging them into my Sith Troopers. Their loyalty is unquestion-able."" The best of the best were chosen and turned into they hyper-loyal soilders. 

Now to turn back the timeline a few thousand years their is SWTOR where the Sith Emperor had spent 300 years (as opposed to 30) building up his empire and fleet. The Sith Emperor gets killed and all looks good only for a expansion to show that nope he lived. He comes back again with another fleet of ships (though to be fair he didn't build these he just found them on a ancient forge world) the https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/90/Eternal_Fleet.png/revision/latest?cb=20151031144638  Eternal Fleet. A fleet of ancient warships each equipped with a superlaser and numbering in the thousands. The fleet had been discovered by the Sith Emperor's explorations of the Unkown Regions. 

Which is kind of the opposite of what the Emperor has seemingly done. The Sith Emperor went to the UR and found a fleet of ships while Palpatine went to the UR and hid a fleet there. 

Going back to the Katana connection it was also a fleet that was lost. Everyone knew about the fleet but it had just disappeared. While this fleet is a secret. No one knew about it before now so it doesn't really have the same backstory. 

And I know many people are thinking that the Resistance may be flying these things (with B1's or other droids I guess. Maybe even a slave circuit like the Katana fleet since they have so few crew) and they may get away with one or two if they are even there when they are found. But the fact that it shows in the recent trailer one of them using their mini-death star laser on the planet plus the falling A-wing in the previous trailer I think its more likely that its going to be used by the bad guys. 

So yeah I get why people would think its the Katana Fleet, its the more well known example and it looks like a fleet waiting to be used. but from a thematic/story point of view I think it bears a lot more in common with the two fleets mentioned in my title. 

AN: And no I'm not saying they copied these ideas or even knew of their existence. I'm just saying that the people looking for something similar to connect it to are making a understandable but incorrect connection.",StarWars,1567123698,TheMastersSkywalker,0,4,True,2019-08-29

A Shattered Galaxy

3800 BBY

The Galactic Republic and their Jedi allies stood firm as the raging tide of the Sith Empire broke itself across their bulwarks. Its remnants hunted down and destroyed, the Sith have finally been eradicated from the Galaxy. The Galactic Republic has declared absolute victory. Urged on by expansionist Corellian Chancellor Risa Penin, the Republic has begun to expand. The Jedi Order, still reeling from the death of Grandmaster Kel Sedaya, struggles to elect a new leader. Meanwhile, Jedi watchmen scour the galaxy, eager to swell their ranks with force-sensitive youngsters.​

Concurrently, the Mandalorians have become restless. Despite claims of peace and cooperation with the Galactic Republic, the recently proclaimed Mandalore aspires to the expansion of Mandalorian culture and influence. Known as Mandalore the Crusader, he is eager to extend the clans’ reach. While another war with the Mandalorians seems likely, the Galactic Republic remains blissfully unaware of a new threat, one lurking beyond the fringes of known space.​

The One Sith, led by a mysterious Dark Lord, have risen to fill the void left behind by the Sith Empire. Strongly adhering to the Rule of One, they stand prepared to strike at the heart of the Galactic Republic and seek to hold dominion over all in the name of their Dark Lord.​

In a shattered galaxy...what role will you play?​

Look at it from a practical point of view, you're not going to use the folding mechanism whilst fighting because I don't see the advantage of using it which seems to be what people are talking about, it doesn't have any combat perks. But people are ignoring this&gt; Where I think it is designed well is when it's not being used for combat and would be on Rey's waist, you see, Rey has proven that she is talented with a polarm/staff type weapon so when she creates the saber of her choice it makes sense to design it similarly to something she is comfortable to using, a weapon with a long handle that can hit from both ends. This is where a problem would arise, because it is more of a staff/polearm than sword the handle is a lot longer (it looks to me like it is longer than darth mauls too) which could become an inconvenience when on her waist so the folding mechanism would allow her to put it away like a normal light saber whilst having the weapon type she desires, this is why I think her saber is well desinged and not stupid.

879,Its happening again. (Rise of Skywalker Theories),"People are making tons and tons of extremely complicated and unlikely theories, just like The Last Jedi.

But the large amounts of people who believe the Clone/Evil Rey theories and every other extremely overly-detailed theories are not only gonna be disappointed when the movie comes out, but they're gonna hate on it for not living up to the expectations.

Regardless whether or not the movie is good, people are gonna go into it expecting specific things to happen by spending all this time theorizing, examining every tiny detail and blowing it out of proportion, and its going to cause backlash. Maybe people have learnt something since The Last Jedi, but I'm afraid that its going to be a repeat; at least with some of the community. I'm scared of the outcome. I'm scared of enjoying the movie if the toxic members of the community are going to rage when they theories and head-canons get debunked in the new movie, because thats what happened with The Last Jedi. People couldn't like or enjoy the movie without someone (usually hordes of people earlier on) harassing them and being toxic. And I know that most of the community isn't like that, but its definitely a noticeable and vocal minority who spread toxicity. Hell, I remember people getting endlessly harassed on certain forums for saying they liked the Sequels, and even now theres always that one person who will comment ""Rian Johnson Ruined Star Wars"" during any discussion about the new movies.

The only reason it lasted as long as it did is because Obi-Wan knows Anakin so well (I mean, duh he literally trained him) so he knows how to fight him. He was able to essentially stall the fight long enough that it lead to Anakin’s downfall being his over-zealousness.

i just watched rotj and obi-wan's famous point of view-quote really stuck to me. and then i wondered if this theme—if i may call it like that—is one of the reasons that made star wars so exciting. if you think about it, the original trilogy is interspersed with insights from different views. here are some i can immediately think of. they are concerned with characters but also with inanimate objects:

\- battle station, not a moon

\- jedi master, not a random green frog

\- jedi master, not a hermit

\- the fastest (?) and coolest spaceship, not some junk

\- space slug, not a cave

\- jedi, not a farm boy

\- father, not the father's murderer

\- sister, not (only) a princess

\- leia, not a bounty hunter

\- lando, not a random guy at jabba's

i know that some of these revelations are minor in surprise-level or wow-factor but some are definitely major and at least one is cinematic history (vader's reveal, obviously). so in my humble opinion it is these different points of view that not only allow for small or big surprising plot twists but really add to the mythology and to what makes star wars so exciting.

can you think of other revelations? maybe from the prequels (princess, not her maid; the chosen one, not a slave) or the latest movies?

894,Do we know if a new animated series is in the works?,"I recently heard that Resistance will end with it's 2nd season. I can't say I'm disappointed as I felt the show only became interesting at the end of the 1st season.

But it does make me wonder what's next on the animation side of Star Wars, if anything.

For a long time now I've been a champion of an animated series set after RotJ starring the whole crew; Luke, Han, Leia, Chewy, Artoo, Threepio, Lando, Nien, Ackbar, etc.

Characters such as Hera, Sabine, Chopper, AP-5 and Rex could be used.

Other characters such as Shriv could even be brought in at some point.

So much could be done from fun one off adventure episodes and over arching story that could explore Luke's search for artifacts, Han and Leia having Ben, beginnings of Luke's new academy.

Also, with the announcement of the comics ending it still leaves a lot to be covered between RotJ and TFA. I don't read them but as far as I know the main run is still only covering stories between ANH and ESB.

But most of all, I just think it would be so cool to see the OT characters going on more adventures together. Something that couldnt really be done in the ST.

So does anyone know if a new show is in the works? 
Is the new series of Clone Wars the focus of animation for now?",StarWars,1567167137,TheVortigauntMan,9,0,True,2019-08-30

What is that about? I'm guessing it can be explained away as Luke trying to look less like a Jedi to drive Rey away, but this feels more like Rian Johnson not liking the lighter outfit for this version of Luke, but having to work around Abrams' choices in TFA.

General consesus I've been fielding online is that Star Wars brand isn't doing to great and the new EP9 is not generating the buzz that any other saga Star Wars episode would be. It's a bit of a shocker because not too long ago I couldn't imagine anything with the Star Wars brand wouldn't be instant gold. Granted the prequels weren't good movies by any stretch of the imagination, but at least they held the reverence for the original lore (not to mention came directly from the mind of it's original auteur). In Disney's hand its nothing but  the brand and aesthetic of what Star Wars actually is. Not going to beat a dead horse over this point. Just look up the commentary online. But in an attempt to get outside my bubble, I'd like to hear from the people that ARE excited about the new film coming in December and is un-phased by all the controversy. Thanks!

He hid out on her ship. She did not know he was there. When he walked out, it clearly looked like she brought him there to confront Anakin. 

While Anakin is responsible, his rage that led to it was stoked by Obi Wan and the perception that even Padme had turned on him. It wasn’t Obi’s intent, but it happened.

962,I kind of like that the ST took Dark Empire and set it 30 years in the future. I think it works better that way. Though I'm not so happy about how its been done.,"In a way I am starting to like the idea of the ST being basically the Dark Empire Saga done 30 years in the future compared to where and how it was used in Legends. In some ways it feels like both a capstone to a story and a jumping off point for it. But in other ways it also feels unearned and like it has been done in a way that doesn't  cap off anything in a pleasing way. 

Their is some conflict here not from admitting I like how the NEU did something compared to how Legends did the same thing but in liking part of it even while not liking the whole package or how we got there.  That is to say I like the idea behind what they are doing but not the finished product

The pro for this is that it is a capstone. In Legends Dark Empire was not a capstone nor did it really come at a unique time. It happened in 10 ABY a year after Thrawn invaded the NR and four years after the NR had taken Coruscant. While it marked the end of the big E Empire the next seven years would be marked by a cold war before finally giving way to peace with the imperial remnant. While palatine was finally defeated and the Empire fractured beyond reformation their was no major change to the galaxy. And it would still be 20 years before The Unifying Force (30 ABY) will act as a place for them to pass the baton of responsibility to a younger generation. 

So placing their ""Dark Empire"" here so far out gives them a way for the final defeat of the entire Star Wars saga's villian to act as the end of a era and the start of a new age. Its not just in the middle of a number of different smaller wars but is the culmination of one that has spanned three trilogies and seventy years. Maybe if Dark Empire (the legends version) had been switched with Vision of the Future in the timeline it would have been received better. And here its having the main villain of the entire saga be the final hurdle to overcome. 

So yeah the timing is good. And that part of it I can admit to liking it and thinking its in a better position than the Legends Dark Empire was. But their are still two problems with it for me. How we got here and what we left behind. 

For example if Dark Empire was to be the capstone of the OT3 era of legends it would be a capstone where the OT3 were the heroes and main characters of said movie. Where they were the ones to finally defeat the ultimate threat to the galaxy and the prophecy of the chosen one. It would be Vader's children who do it and would leave the galaxy with the Skywalkers in a good place to continue on. 

But what will the Skywalker legacy be at this point? I mean for one we keep being told that Rey is no one, she is not a skywalker and not part of the story. But the movies have been about her. Even if the force is acting though her as its new chosen one it would be saying that the Skywalkers have failed and need someone else to help them. It could even feel like making the Skywalkers redundant. Same for Kylo. Yes he is a Skywalker and yes the movies are partially about him. And yes luke went dark in Dark Empire. But it was because he thought he could go undercover not because he was obsessed with power and vader like Kylo. So even if Kylo is able to finish what his grandfather started and dies redeemed the Skywalker legacy will have ended and ended in darkness. At least at the end of Legacy of the Force we had Ben, Allana, and Jaina. But maybe that is what they are going for. That the Skywalkers time is over in the universe, that after the prophecy has been fulfilled their is no more need for the Skywalker line. Ok, thats fair and kind of interesting but that brings me to what really bothers me with accepting this. 

Dark Empire was not the capstone for the OT3's adventures in Legends. That would be the New Jedi Orders: Unifying Force book. It was set up as the end of a saga and so that it could be a jumping off point for future stories (though it didn't end up happening in the way many of us wanted.)

It ended with a universe where Luke had a flourishing Jedi Order that accepted all different force users (LS only though), marriage, emotions, and fixed the problems of the past. Even outside of his family their were many more knights who had learned under Luke or other students and were ready to carry on the flame. 

The government its self was strong and competent. Leia's legacy as a strong leader had allowed the NR to stay together during the war and helped it transition into the more stable GFFA. A nation with a military ready and able to deal with external threats and protect its people. 

The heroes of the OT had spent thirty years building up the Jedi Order and New Republic government and everything that came later would be built off of that bedrock. Even though it felt like the end of a era it was still a happy end because it felt like what would come next would build off of what was created. 

But if we look at the NEU we see that isn't the same. Luke's order is dead and gone. No matter what adventures we get with him between RotJ and TFA we know how they all end. With his order destroyed and him on the island. 

Leia's NR that she spend her childhood and adulthood fighting so hard for is gone. Though really it was never really there. A fraction the size of the Old Republic with 1% of the naval forces they had at the height of the rebellion the NR couldn't defend its self from even pirate attacks. Not to mention that the FO secretly controlled half of it and used that to keep it weak and ineffectual before having half the planets defect to them before The Force Awakened and before they blew it up. 

What then is left to build off of? Any Order Rey builds will be based on the books and herself not on Luke's teachings or guidance (though the trailer does give me hope. We will have to wait and see on this point). Any New Republic that is formed will not be the one Leia fought for and helped build.  If its supposed to be capping off the Skywalker legacy its not leaving anything behind to build off of. Just building over. 

The unvierse will continue spinning. The FO will fracture and we will get the same kind of imperial warlords storeis again. The Grysk will show up and give us our invasions. The sith troopers may even being back the Sith in the future stories. But the Jedi Order and New Republic that will face them will not be part of the Skywalker Legacy. 

If the ST is a capstone of the Skywalker legacy its a capstone that seals them and their influence into a seventy year period where they may end up leaving myths and legends but not one where they will leave anything you can reach out and touch. 

So yeah I like the ST being Dark Empire set thirty years in the future as a sort of capstone on the Skywalker family and a jumping off point to new stories. I can admit to that part of the NEU being done better than in Legends. I just feel like it has been done in a way where our heroes were doomed to fail and where what comes next wont be building off of things they did but building over them. 

But again maybe thats what they want to do. It is the ""end of the skywalker saga"" so maybe they want the skywalkers to just be a thing for 70 years, a once in a millennium thing to set up the way for things that don't build off their legacy but can be built because of it.",StarWars,1564505452,TheMastersSkywalker,1,4,True,2019-07-30
963,Wikipedia article is way to biased on “The Last Jedi “,"The article focused heavily on critic reviews, and flat out lies about user reviews. It says the average rating on metacritic is 4.4, which is somehow true, but then leaves out the fact that there were 2,905 positive rating, 1,101 mixed rating, and a whopping 4,028 negative ratings. I don’t understand how that would cause a 4.4 star rating. And it even quotes “survey monkey” which claims 93% of users gave positive reviews, and 63% of “hardcore fans” said it was the best Star Wars movie of all times. 

It also claims “At Rotten Tomatoes, 44% of users rated the film 3.5 stars or higher” but in reality should say “it has a 44% user score.”

976,Old Republic TV series idea,"First of all I would have made a trilogy of films about the origins of the Jedi and the Sith and the series starts after that.  
Series 1: Starts with the Old Sith Empire under the leadership of Marka Ragnos. Shows his death and Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh fighting for the throne. Eventually Republic explorers including Freedon Nadd discover the Sith Empire and Sadow takes the throne and Nadd as his apprentice. The Sith Empire attacks the Republic and initially has the upper hand but infighting between Sadow's and Kressh's followers weakens the Empire. Eventually Kressh is killed and Sadow and Nadd along with loyal Massassi warriors flee to Yavin 4 where Nadd kills Sadow and places himself in suspended animation. Meanwhile the Republic attacks Korriban and the Sith led by Vitiate flee to the Outer Rim which hasn't been discovered by the Republic yet.  
Series 2: Shows Exar Kun's life as a Jedi and he awakens Nadd and trains under him. Kun kills Nadd, enslaves the Massassi and starts the Great Sith War. From there it follows the same story as the comics with Ulic Cel Droma and the Brotherhood of the Sith. The few remaining Sith and their forces flee to Korriban, demoralised while Tulak Hord discovers and joins Vitiate's Sith Empire.  
Series 3: Mandolorian Wars. Malak's backstory is changed as he is a padawan and his master is killed defending him against Mandolorians. When Revan decides to fight the Mandolorians Alek is the 1st to join him and Revan takes on Malak as his padawan. In the final few episodes Revan and Alek travel to the Sith Empire and after fighting a few Sith, are captured and brought to Vitiate who brainwashes them and has them trained as Sith Lords but the 2 break free.  
Series 4: Revan and his apprentice Malak along with Tulak Hord and a handful of other Sith travel to Korriban and take control of Exar Kun's remaining forces and reopen the Sith academy with Hord as its head. Revan and Malak then convince the Republic forces loyal to them to join their new empire and send the Jedi loyal to him to the Sith academy. Revan and Malak then discover the Star Forge and begin the Jedi Civil War. In the end Malak's ship destroys Revan's and Malak takes control of the Sith Empire.  
Series 5: Based on KOTOR 1 and Revan is played by a different actor as it's explained that his body was dying so it was completely regenerated similar to the time lords in Doctor Who and this explains why no one recognises Revan.  
Series 6: Based on KOTOR 2. We also see the Jedi Purge and the Sith Civil War.  
The next couple of series after that can be based upon the Great Hyperspace War, the Old Republic and the New Sith Wars. Then this could be immediately followed by a Darth Bane trilogy.",StarWars,1564517055,fatherandyriley,0,1,True,2019-07-30

983,Is Kylo Ren worthy/capable of redemption?,"Redemption has always been a central theme in Star Wars. The ultimate redemption of Darth Vader is one of the most iconic moments in movie history.

It feels like Rey is being set up to redeem Kylo, but I think this is a red herring. Annakin Skywalker fell to save Padmé, and the seeds of his redemption were sown when he realized he had a son. He dies, ultimately dying for his horrible deeds and saving his son.

Kylo... Kylo is worse. Why did he fall? Ambiguous corruption from Snoke and a perceived assassination attempt by Luke Skywalker. He murdered his fellow students right after, who had not done anything wrong. Kylo then, presumably, joins up with snoke and somewhere along the road has fallen far enough to casually order the massacre of an entire village. He feels that he could turn back to the light side, but turns it down. This is significantly different from Darth Vader, who stated that \`it is too late for me\`. Darth Vader never felt he could turn back. Kylo Ren knows he can turn back to the light at any moment, but instead does whatever he can to remain evil, including killing his unarmed father. He wants to be evil.

Kylo Ren is probably the most complex, most original character in the new trilogy (so far) but he is also the most evil. Honestly, he feels like someone who, if left unchecked, would grow up to a new Palpatine. Except with a good bit of inferiority complex and the need to constantly prove how evil he is. I can\`t see an argument that Rey or Leia could make to turn him back to the light. He hates the light, fears the light.

1000,I noticed something that made Anakin killing the younglings even sadder.,"Anakin killing the younglings at the Jedi Temple is considered the most heinous act he committed during the attack. Not just because he was killing children but the fact he killed children who trusted him and looked up to him. 

I noticed one little thing about the scene which made me better appreciate just how horrible the downfall was. 

There were a lot of reasons why Anakin was resentful of the council. One of those reasons was that Anakin felt he was being purposely held back and denied his rank as master. The council knew he had an ego and that aspect of his personality was a problem. They attempted to not feed into it.

That being said, it ultimately backfired. He didn't believe the council trusted him and even with all of his successes and his prowess as a Jedi, he was denied the rank after being appointed to the council. *(though the Jedi only did this out of courtesy to Palpatine's request)*

This is what makes the scene so heartbreaking to me.

**This is where the observation comes in:**

When Anakin enters the council chamber room (the same room where he was denied the rank of master by the council) he finds the younglings hiding. One of them approaches him and what does he say?

What does he say?

[""**Master Skywalker!** There are too many of them. What are we going to do?""](https://youtu.be/YnwkE4trA48)

That made it much more sadder for me.

He was a master in their eyes even if he didn't have the rank. The youngest of the order saw no difference between him and the actual masters of the order. Even though he didn't have the rank he wanted, he had the respect of the younglings and the respect of the other Jedi who looked up to him with the same reverence as various masters. 

You can make the argument that the fact he was called ""master"" in the room where he was denied the rank only compounded the anger and hatred that fueled his fall to the dark side. He likely even imagined he was slaughtering the council members when he was killing the younglings. 

My point is the fact he was called master really amplified the tragedy for me.",StarWars,1564540391,TanookiDooki,19,55,True,2019-07-30

How will all the Jedi die? How does the Republic become the Empire? How does Anakin become Darth Vader? What are the clones gonna do? How will they do the Obi-Wan Vader fight?

After TFA, there were so much questions and excitement about who was going to happen, will Luke train Rey? What's Luke been doing this whole time? Is he a grey Jedi? Will Kylo Ren kill Leia, etc. But in TLJ, everything felt like an ending, and there are no cliffhangers or anything to keep you asking questions to lead into TROS beyond the generic ones like how the Resistance is going to win against the First Order, or how Rey's going to beat Kylo Ren for the second time. We know she's not gonna have a new lightsaber since she just rebuilds it and the Palpatine laugh could be an interesting reveal, but that was revealed in a *teaser trailer*, that wasn't set up anywhere in the ST as far as we know.

1013,"Do you think there is a chance Disney might abandon the new ""Canon"" at some point and switch back to Legends?","If you think about it, the most well received stuff are things taken from Legends. Thrawn is a good example. 

Thrawn was poorly handled in the new Canon tho. Everyone adores KOTOR and KOTOR 2, which still have a risk of being placed as non canon due 

Luke from Legends is pretty much what people love about him.

Darth Bane Trilogy, Revan, Plagueis etc. The only exceptions are Ahsoka and Maul who do not exist in Legends. Everything outside of those 2 characters is either disliked or no one really cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the Last Jedi, people HATED a lot of canon stuff. It also does not help that all new ""Canon"" books, comics and cartoons (including Rebels), felt like filler content with no substance. 90% of the new stories are also set during Galactic Civil War, which feels over saturated. The story of Battlefront 2 is a perfect representation of all the new Canon non-movie stories (you can make of that what you will).

&amp;#x200B;

Legends existed for years and it's golden age was from 2000-2011 with stories set before/during and after the movies. Not just in one single period.

&amp;#x200B;

Apon viewing this photo numerous times and listening to subsequent chat regarding it and others over on Collider Jedi Council. It came to me, if this photo is not from a Flashback then Luke has to be alive, otherwise why would R2 be by his side? Droids are not force sensitive, and I'm not aware in canon of a Droid being able to see a force ghost, so if you put 2 &amp; 2 together it would suggest he's survived.

1017,If I was in charge of making the spin off films,"I'd make the 1st film a Mace Windu film in which it's revealed he survived and has gone into exile on a planet with a small hidden Jedi temple. At the start he's a drunken, broken wreck who has lost everything but he meets and befriends a force sensitive zabrak girl who's skilled in using a staff who secretly observes him using the force and tries to copy him. When the Empire takes over the planet the locals ask Windu for his help but he initially refuses as he's wanted. Yoda and Qui-Gon contact him in a vision and convince him to come out of hiding. Windu then builds a new lightsaber, gets back in shape and takes on the zabrak as his padawan who builds a saberstaff. He teaches the locals how to defend themselves and repel the Empire and defeat an inquisitor who escapes. Windu knows that the Empire will return so the locals begin to evacuate and Windu and his padawan fight Vader and the inquisitor. When the inquisitor loses an arm, Vader angrily kills the inquisitor for their failure and Windu knows they're outmatched so he dies holding off Vader while his padawan escapes along with the other locals to join the rebellion.  
After that I would make a Clone Commando trilogy.  
Republic Commando is based on the video game and takes place during the Clone Wars. Galen Erso and Krennic both appear in the film as engineers who help design the equipment used by the clones.  
Imperial Commando focuses on the commandos helping Vader hunt the Jedi and rebels but when they meet the Jedi general they served under during the Clone Wars who is working with the rebels and padawan from the Windu film they choose to join the rebellion in the end. It's in this film we get to see scenes similar to the Vader scene in Rogue One.  
Rebel Commando is similar to Rogue One only with the Clone Commandos instead. Tarkin's face is never seen close-up, he's always turned around, at a distance or his face is obscured by a shadow. Instead of the Vader corridor scene, Vader fights on the front lines on the beaches of Scariff. The Commandos along with the Jedi still die in the end.",StarWars,1564584270,fatherandyriley,0,1,True,2019-07-31

Does the rating of Star Wars Rebels which is TV-Y7 hurt the series any.   The grit of The Clone Wars added to story and stakes of every episode showing how sinister (some) separatists can be. The show dealt with mature themes that could teach adults and young adults different facts of life and keep them interested and engaged without alienating children but now we are talking about Disney and I’m terrified Rebels will not live up to this especially after seeing 2 episodes where storm troopers would still move or breath after being shot.

LEGO Star Wars, while simple games, gold a special place in the heart of many Star Wars fans. I remember being in junior high and couldn’t wait to get home and play LEGO Star Wars II the original trilogy. 

When the complete saga was released, and subsequently the criminally underrated LEGO Star Wars the Clone Wars, so many thought that was the end of the zeitgeist. Force awakens released to little fanfare as it was a singular title, as opposed to collective nature of the others.

Many though we would eventually get an HD remake of the complete saga, but boy did we underestimate. 

We are getting a full remake (from the ground up) of all 9 Star Wars films, hundreds of characters, open ended gameplay exploration, totally unlocked story progression so you can go any where in the saga you want. Additionally we’re getting The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, both of which have not been adapted to LEGO games yet.

I do feel stupid for asking it, but I haven't watched the new movies, and it's been at least 10 years since I watched the VHS ones, and I feel like an idiot. But I'm confused.

The Galactic Republic

The First Order

The Galactic Empire

The Separatists

The Resistance

The Rebel Alliance

I'm sorry for asking such a dumb question, but I wanted to know who each of these factions really were. If my memory serves me correct, the Resistance and Rebels are considered the ""Good Guys"", and people have told me the Republic is the Clone Troopers, which, if I remember correctly are also good.

1043,My ideal finale for episode 9.,"Ah man, all I can think about is this idea that popped in my head. Just thinking about it gives me chills. Imagine these two things happening at the finale:

The biggest space battle yet:
Somehow, the resistance clashes with the first order on Jakku. The resistance does find a decent sized fleet backed up by Lando. But the first order is just too big. General Hux and Pryde order almost every single destroyer to this battle. They fight back but get stuck on a string. Poe sends an emergency signal to every person in the galaxy. Before the final battle starts, slowly ships from different planets start arriving out of hyperspace. The mandalorians, mon calamari, outer rim factions, and almost every warring faction against the first order arrives and clashes into a battle bigger than the battle of coruscant in RoTS. We see references of ships from the clone wars (republic and separatist vessels), modified imperial ships, and all sorts of cool stuff.

The most epic final scene with Rey and Kylo:
My theory is that there will be this final battle between Kylo, Rey and the emperor. The two will clash and it will be the most epic battle, even stated by daisy Ridley. Imagine that Rey and kylo team up to defeat the emperor, who somehow manages to come back through one of the knights of ren. They manage to defeat the vessel, but Kylo is weak and the emperor manages to posses his consciousness. Though this, we see the infamous Sith eyes in kylo and he uses force lightning to attack Rey. This pivotal moment shows that he is all powerful against her. But, she’s not alone. 
A shot is shown with her, but every single Jedi (that existed before her) force ghost will be behind her backing her up. With her glowing blue eyes, they clash with force powers and ultimately, the face of good vs evil is shown. UGH I WOULD POOP MY PANTS IF THIS HAPPENED. You can elaborate what happens here.

1052,For people who at least like all of the films - what are your gentle criticisms of them?,"Preamble: I saw the OT on VHS when I was 5 in the early 90s and fell instantly in love; I was 10 when TPM came out, and adored it; as a 13 year old wanted to like AOTC a little more than I did; and as a 16 year old absolutely loved ROTS, even as a couple of bits made me (affectionately) roll my eyes. I was a little disappointed with TFA on first viewing, but adored Rogue One and loved TLJ (partly because it adds so much to the previous film, and patched up a lot of my issues with TFA).   
My point is, I am a Star Wars fan who enjoys all of the films, who is glad they all exist, and who feels that many of their flaws are a) charming and b) the kind of silliness an imagination weird enough to come up with all the amazing stuff is gonna throw out now and then. 

My question is, assuming you're coming from a similar place, what small things bug you a little about them? 

This is not a thread for histrionic, perspective-free, hateful shite along the lines of 'I just hate the character, it's not the performer's fault, it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s fault for giving him/her awful dialogue', etc.   


**Eps IV-VI**

* Leia gets the short shrift in RotJ 
* The ground section of the Battle of Endor is \*maybe\* a little too played for fun (having said that, I think its light adventure feel balances well with the more intense duel and space battle sequences)

**Eps I-III**

* Anakin does come across a little too much as a creep during the 1st half of AotC. Lucas does write Anakin suitably nobly during the 2nd half of the film and the first half of ROTS though.
* The details of the clone conspiracy are a little bit cack-handedly thought through - the concept's great, the pay-off's great, but \*all\* the Jedi seeing Jango with Dooku and their alarm bells not going off is.... mighty odd. 

**Eps VII-VIII**

* Not enough galactic context in VII. On first viewing, I felt more confused as a SW fan (Why isn't Leia with the Republic? What kind of entity is the First Order?) than someone who'd only ever seen the OT once (Ah right, I remember, the baddies are the guys in white with the dagger ships). This could've been cleared up in about 30 seconds and/or a hologram of the galaxy, and is a weird, weird creative decision that seems born out of knee-jerk 'duh, Mr Plinkett and hordes of hack media writers didn't like the 8 collective minutes of politics sequences in the prequels, so we better not have any exposition'). 
* The oh-so-millennial-movie lines they lumber Finn with in TFA - 'Are we doing this? Are we really doing this?!', 'Did you see that?! Did you see that!?' They feel very self-conscious, fakey, and unnecessary attempts to tell the audience 'Be excited!'",StarWars,1564657024,RexBanner1886,20,3,True,2019-08-01
1053,"An appreciation of The Last Jedi and why the phrase ""subverted expectations"" should not be simple mockery","I keep seeing people use ""this subverted my expectations"" as some sort of bizarre insult and it really bothers me.

Though I really loved TFA, I was worried that TLJ was gonna borrow a lot of elements from ESB and ultimately be predictable. After the final trailer, I was even more worried. It heavily implied Luke training Rey after some initial reluctance, Kylo presumably killing Leia, and Rey facing Kylo and turning him to the light side. I was sure I knew exactly where the story was heading. But in the end, not one bit of the film's main elements went as expected. The adrenaline rush of pure shock I felt when leaving the theatre was something I'll never forget. 

Ultimately, a film subverting the viewer's expectations is a positive quality if done correctly. I often see the argument that Rian Johnson ""focused too much on subverting expectations that he didn't write a cohesive or compelling story"", but I think this is a huge oversimplification. Though some of the film's arcs may be unsatisfying to some, there are many that find the story very compelling and cohesive. ""My expectations were subverted"" has turned into pure mockery and to some has largely lost all its meaning. Almost two years later, I still see the phrase thrown at everything from TLJ and Game of Thrones, to Stranger Things. At the end of the day, filmmakers have absolutely no responsibility to fulfil fan theories or expectations. Simply arguing that a film is bad because it didn't do what you expected is disingenuous and takes away from actual valid criticism, and this is so often the impression I get from those who use the phrase.

Say what you will about TLJ (it is absolutely fine to dislike it) but it very much did try something new. And I know that I personally would rather have a divisive film that goes in a new directions, than a simply bland one that everyone agrees was just ""ok"". I don't know about you but I am ready and waiting for my expectations to be subverted this December.",StarWars,1564660266,RabidSpaceFruit,480,14,True,2019-08-01

1068,Why the First Order would have only battlecruisers and above in TFA/TLJ and why it doesn't make sense,"(Personally not a fan of TLJ for various reasons, but here it is) 

At the end of WWI the allies placed armament restrictions on Germany, I'm assuming that since it appears that the New Republic knew about the First Order they would have placed armament restrictions on them limiting the number of ships they could have (obviously Starkiller base was kept secret), but that begs the question: Why no screening vessels? If you're consuming stars for energy with a planet sized weapon AND expanding the resources to keep it secret why on earth would you not have at least Tartan Patrol Cruisers or similar starfighter screening vessels in secret as well? Not to mention the tactical effectiveness of missile cruisers against starfighters. Beyond that battlecruisers are highly inflexible, they are designed to be fleet killers, but  they cannot carry land forces very well if they have large weapons, and they are major targets for starfighter raids as we saw with the Dreadnaught in TLJ and the Executor in TRJ. Excellent investments for shipyard defense and shock fleets however, but only with support ships and ISD equivalents to back it up. 

I get that TIE S/Fs are amazing, but yeesh, you'd think that the resurrected empire would learn from Thrawn and the Galactic civil war, but no.

I also thought the characters were very well written and overall the movie had a good plot but, like I said, could be a bit boring and slow at times. What do you guys think?

1102,"Has anyone else struggled to get ""back into"" Star Wars since The Last Jedi?","I'm not here to talk about whether or not it was a good movie, or even complain about it (although it may come off that way).

Rather, I feel like TLJ fundamentally *changed* what Star Wars was. It felt like being a movie was secondary, to it being a platform for social justice issues. It felt very in-your-face, at the expense of the story itself (the casino planet literally contributed nothing to the movie).

But the thing that bums me out, is that it (and to be fair, also The Force Awakens) killed off the characters I'd grown up with. It was no longer a fun space Odyssey, it wasn't even about setting up a powerful conflict. Instead, it was just showing how perfect Rey is, and... not much else.

I can't even enjoy the original trilogy now, because I'm constantly thinking ""Well, I guess all these characters have terrible lives in the end, and Luke tries to murder his nephew"".

Again, I'm really *not* trying to complain about TLJ. It just bums me out, that I feel like it radically impacts everything else.

1104,What is your favorite Star Wars memory?,"Mine is one Christmas when I was probably 11 years old.  Santa used to lay me and my siblings presents out unwrapped in our own individual “piles”.  It was great because I would walk into the living room Christmas morning and immediately knew which pile was mine.  It was almost overwhelming trying to take in every present laid before me on Christmas mornings. Also as a side bonus I got to see what my siblings were receiving and it always made me happy seeing the toys or whatever gift I knew they wanted was there.  

Anyways, my favorite memory is walking into the living room and seeing about 20 Star Wars action figures all laid out in neat rows. These were the figures from the 90s.  Everyone was there: Luke, Han, Chewie, R2, 3PO, Vader, Leia, Yoda. Obi Wan, I mean everyone from the old trilogy was there. Even the Jawas.  There were even 3 storm troopers!  My parents got me 3 of the same figure and I loved it! I wouldn’t think that as a parent I would know to get my child 3 of the same exact toy but mine did and I loved it.  Not only were the figures all accounted for, but behind the figures were several vehicles. Luke’s land speeder, speeder bikes, a ATST(? The chicken walker), and to top it off Boba Fett’s Slave 1!  I had so much fun with all these toys. 

That’s it.  I don’t have a whole lot of vivid memories from childhood but this is definitely one that sticks out. I was amazed that they got me so many figures, I thought they had to have spent a fortune on me and it kinda made me feel bad like I didn’t deserve all that or for them to sacrifice things for me. But now that I am a parent myself I get it.  First, the figures were only $4.99 so it probably wasn’t as expensive as I thought as a child. Second, that’s what we as parents are supposed to do. It’s not hard to be a good parent; if you work hard and spend your money on your child rather than selfish endeavors, pay your bills, and always try to teach your child, I think you’re probably doing a good job.  And don’t do the obvious things like hitting your kid or letting them go hungry or dirty. That shouldn’t need to be stated but there are some really shitty parents out there and if any of you ever had to go through some type of neglect or abuse I am sorry for you and hope you are ok as you mature.

1105,What Should Galaxy's Edge Add/Improve Upon? (My Suggestions),"Now, I've not been to Disney's latest theme park yet, so I can't speak on how well I thought it was. From what I've read and heard about it, it seems that it's alright for what it has. Although many have cited that the prices seem too high for merch and there's been complaints about inconveniences that are caused by too many crowds. But now as of late, it's reported by various blogs and visitors that the park is rather low or mild on crowds. Apparently, they may be lower than expected for this time of year.

I know that the park is incomplete, and if I remember hearing right, Iger said they would add more to it in the future.

But for those Star Wars fans who aren't interested in the park right now, what would convince you to spend some good money to visit an incomplete park with some high prices for merchandise and food/beverages?

Must they lower the prices of everything altogether? And if so, by how much?

And should they add anything more to the park to convince you to pay a ticket? What would they need to add to exceed your expectations?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some suggestions I brainstormed that they could consider adding. And this does mean, they will have to embrace aspects of the prequels and original trilogies.

\- Make more engaging flight simulator experiences like Smuggler's Run by making X-Wings and TIE Fighters ridable. Make an entire squadron of Rebel and Imperial fighters ridable so people can pilot them in an engaging simulation experience where they are participants in epic space battles. Have people relive the Battles of Scarif, Yavin, Endor, Starkiller Base, etc. by giving them an actual experience of what it's like to be a pilot for the Rebels/Empire. They could even include Jedi Starfighters, like Anakin's and Kenobi's to simulate the Battle of Coruscant. Basically, they could take the graphics and gameplay from EA's Battlefront games, except the controls for the gameplay would be the actual controls in the cockpit. Imagine actually being a part of Red Squadron as you come upon the Death Star and enter its trenches.

\- Another experience they could have is letting people undergo trials to become either a Jedi Knight or a Sith Lord. This could easily be done by having people complete challenges/puzzles that would test and teach them about the Jedi and Sith doctrines. Instead of having Savi's workshop, why don't they have a lightsaber building experience conducted by Jedi like the ritual on Ilum known as The Gathering. Then give people activities to train with the lightsaber like deflecting bolts from a remote (this can be done through a VR helmet that looks like the training helmet Luke wore on the Falcon). 

Let people spar with others in a battle arena so they can learn basic lightsaber techniques. Of course, since most people aren't skilled at fencing, they'd have to be basic sparring sessions so it's safe and accessible to anyone. Then they could give people an experience where they're given the illusion of using the Force like working together to lift a downed ship in the air. And once all of these trials are completed, then a person is eligible for Knighthood by kneeling before Master Yoda as he officially makes you a Jedi Knight.  

The inverse of these Jedi Trials would be the Sith's Dark Trials where the lightsaber building would be about bleeding your kyber crystal red. Then have three trials where people must conquer their fears, use hatred to wreak destruction, and harness the Dark Side for power.  

For the trial to conquer fears, they could have like a Haunted House experience where you'll encounter some of the horrific monsters/creatures in the galaxy; such as the Rancor, the Wampa, a hive of Geonosians, a swarm of Mynocks, the Ghosts of dead Sith Lords, and even the Bor Gullet. The creatures could be done through animatronics.  

For the trial to wreak destruction, you'll play the role as a commander, viewing your troops from a hologram as they infiltrate Jedi or Rebel forces. Your task will be to direct your troops and vehicles so they cause the most damage and deaths in the battle to win. Think of the game Empire at War, but you'll play from the Sith's side.  

And for the trial to use the Dark Side, you'll spar with another Sith Acolyte and be encouraged to release your anger against them. And when you defeat the Acolyte in the sparring duel, you will be encouraged to finish them off with a Force Choke (this is where the cast member's acting comes in and they grab their neck and fall to the ground once it cracks). Also, I know this may be a little too dark for kids or the soft-hearted. So, anyone is allowed to back out of the Dark Trials if they cannot handle the ""horrors.""  And finally for those who were strong enough to finish all the Dark Trials, you will enter a familiar Throne Room where none other than the Dark Lord Darth Sidious will officially make you a Sith.   

\- Some additional activities would be training to become either a Stormtrooper or Rebel/Resistance soldier. They can teach you how to shoot a blaster and you can participate in a training session where it'll be akin to lasertag. Perhaps they can have this in a room replicating some locations where famous battles took place. They probably won't be able to do planet environments in these rooms cause it'd be way too much work, but they could realistically do locations like the corridors of the Tantive IV, the halls of the Death Star, or the barracks of the clone factory on Kamino. 

\- And one other thing I'd want to see more in Galaxy's Edge is more aliens. Seems like the majority of cast members are humans and that is a little disappointing for a Star Wars theme park. Why can't the cast members dress like Twi'leks, Zabraks, Mirialans, Pantorans, or Togrutas? Those species can readily be done with face paint and some headdresses. They could also have some cast members dress like Neimoidians, Cereans, Pau'ans, Nautolans, Gamorreans, and even hire smaller people to play Ewoks and Ugnaughts. They could also put a Hutt animatronic in the cantina. It doesn't have to be Jabba. But a Hutt that talks and moves, in addition to some dancers and band members. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see, those are the experiences that you wouldn't find anywhere except a Star Wars theme park. Many things in Galaxy's Edge right now are things I could actually purchase or experience outside of the park for much cheaper prices. So I think they should convince fans to visit by having them experience things you wouldn't be able to in any other place. Give visitors more activities that they would only be able to do in this specific theme park. Give them the experience of being a pilot in an X-Wing or TIE Fighter. Give them the experience to become a Jedi or Sith. Give them the experience of what it's like to be a trooper for the Rebels or Empire. Have them interact and talk with other aliens and creatures. This is everything six-year-old me would've wanted if they made a theme park for Star Wars.

1113,Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a fantastic film. Is this still a controversial opinion?,"So I wasn't a big Star Wars fan. The prequels came out when I was young enough to be excited about them, or at least should have been. I never got around to watching them, but I remember all my friends loving them. I ended up watching the originally trilogy by the time I was in high school. The Force Awakens came out by the time i was graduating. 

Watching Episode VII in theaters is what really got me into the franchise. It was cool and exciting, and really helped me understand the awe people must have felt from watching A New Hope. I had to check it out in theaters because Star Wars is Star Wars. New movies are practically historic events. 

But that's just it, Episode VII it felt a lot like Episode IV. And with the over saturation of Star War being back, that excitement was kinda dying down. By the time The Last Jedi came out, I wasn't keen on seeing it in theaters. Then people trashed the hell out of the movie and I felt like watching it even less. But as I'm browsing through Netflix, there it is. 

This movie was great. Really really great. I felt for Rose's sister dying in the bomber. I was excited when Leia started floating through space (as cheesy as it was). I loved the stressful scenario of the fleet having to keep themselves at a certain distance from the First Order's canons. Rose was a pretty cool character and made an amazing point of ""not fight what we hate, but saving what we love"" (although the kiss was a bit forced). Luke having this hard time coping with the mistakes made from being a renowned galaxy messiah, spectacular. Awesome set pieces. Great arc for the hotshot Poe Dameron. And all the while this nuanced dynamic between Rey and Kylo was so compelling.

And finally, the shot of that force sensitive boy tending to the space horse stables, wearing the resistance ring, broom in hand - his shadow silhouetting a little Jedi. Wow. 

I don't know if keeping Ryan Johnson would have been the best idea. But I really wish they just let a director complete their vision for this story. I can't help but worry about Episode IX, but I think I'm reinvigorated to watch it in theaters again.

Their seems to be a good balance between action, plot, character developpment. Even the humor is not overbearing and it the show still manages to feel serious when it needs to.

The funny thing is the way I ended up deciding to finally picking it up. I played Republic Commando on xbox, which in turn made me want to re-read the novel ""True Color"" that was picking up dust on my shelve for years, which in turn made me look for more material that covers clone/madalorian stuff.

1141,Who are the most powerful beings in the franchise?,"I always love these discussions. Not biggest Star Wars guy, but I've been watching it for my entire life. Had a few action figures, fun stuff..

Anyway I'll throw this up to start.

Darth Vader- I've read he could only hit a fragment of his original potential as the cyborg he has become.. But on the flip side it made him into the most durable character in the franchise. When he saves Luke from the Emperor in Return of the Jedi.. He eats a shit ton of that force lightning- I always thought he could have survived the ordeal. He just couldn't live with the guilt of the fun stuff he did, so he told Luke to fuck off. 

Additionally on Vader, I remember reading a comic years ago. They had a Vader/Maul duel. It looked good for Maul taking Vader. But Vader baits maul into a abdominal stab, bringing him close enough for Vader to execute him. Vader just eats the lightsaber stab that would have killed anyone else. beast.

Master Yoda- I won't ramble as him as much. But Yoda is ancient, I'd like to believe he's a fragment of his younger self. Maybe not in total wisdom, but his physical abilities and abilities to manipulate the force in battle! I think that's why he lost to Palpetine.

1151,What if Qui-Gon survived?,"How would the Star Wars canon change if Qui-Gon had survived his duel with Maul? 

Here's my theory:


In the Phantom Menace, it seems that the main reason the Council allowed Anakin to train as a Jedi was to honor the dying wishes of Qui-Gon. So if Qui-Gon survived his duel with Maul, the Council would most likely have denied Anakin a place in the Jedi Academy due to his age and his intense emotions. But in the Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon told the Council that he would train Anakin in the Force with or without their approval. So if they turned Anakin away, Qui-Gon would have left the Jedi Order to train Anakin separate from the influence of the Council. It's clear that Qui-Gon is more of a ""Gray"" Jedi, being much more balanced between the Light and Dark sides of the Force than other Jedi like Yoda who only embrace the Light. Qui-Gon would have trained Anakin to embrace both sides of the Force, allowing him to accept and move past his emotional baggage rather than bottling it up like Yoda encouraged him to do. Anakin would grow up to be just as powerful as he was in the original series, but he would be much wiser and emotionally tame. The balance that Qui-Gon taught him could have allowed him to fulfill the prophecy of the Chosen One in a different way, still eventually bringing balance to the Force.",StarWars,1561996898,jack-metivier,7,7,True,2019-07-01

We don't really know where Anakin came from, his mother claims ""there was no father"" but what if that's only true... from a certain point of view.

If Palpatine engineered the birth of Anakin in the first place, knowing he would be strong in the force, knowing he could be turned, that brings us back home in a pretty dramatic fashion.

There was that line in Phantom Menace... ""We will watch your career with great interest..."" But what if he was watching and guiding Anakin all along?

I think it will be one of those things that it's sort of the last few lines of the film and people are like, ah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.""*

\- **On JJ quelling on-set queries:** *""JJ said to me ... someone was saying oh I'm not sure about this in the grand scheme of things, when we were filming, because we were piecing things together as we went. And he said, if it works in the moment, it will work. And regardless of what you feel ... if it works in a small way, it will work in a big way. And the audience anyway put themselves into the film...Everything we did felt really, really good.""*

\- **On working with Adam**: *""I just think they've just done a great job on all the relationships - with the fun friendships and with the sort of strange thing with Rey and Kylo. And the thing is too, we finished episode eight and you know where Rey is, entirely. So it was interesting going into that and sort of figuring out where that was going. There was a way JJ was describing it when we were doing it and I was like, god, that's so true, that really is what this film is for Rey. I think people are going to like it. (Laughs).

I was really happy the Vanity Fair pictures did show a bit of it. It's a great fight. Like I've become such a better fighter, and they made the lightsabers lighter, so it actually looks like we're swinging light, and not heavy heavy... I have (seen a cut of it).

The sprites are a bit glitchy due to some changes i had to make but its still a fun game and you can still tell what the sprites are and as long as its fun its good 

The vehicle levels will be water levels and link (hes the base for all of the characters)  will look like the vehicle used in the level

1200,Order to watch for a first-timer?,"So I successfully convinced a friend of mine to give Star Wars another chance. Before this he watched the first few minutes of RoTS and didn't like it so I'm trying to find the right order so that hopefully he'll want to keep watching it. Legit the only things he knows about Star Wars is that ""Rey is a good fighter"", ""space battles"", and ""There's a guy named Darth Vader"". I initially just told him release order but he's kinda snobby and picky when it comes to VFX so I'm worried that he'll be immediately turned off by ANH just because it doesn't look as visually enhanced as modern films. So I was thinking chronological order but I feel like TPM isn't as strong without knowing the context of the world  that the movie is in.

I know similar questions have been asked before but I think this is specific enough to post.

So, we all remember that moment when anakin gets the suit and mask and truely becomes darth vader. My theory is that when he was lying on that table, he was using Padme’s lifeforce to survive.
Some points that could prove it:
-she died as he lives around the same time presumably
-Sidious mentioned being able to save people from dying, but never how. What if it was through using someone else’s lifeforce?
-Sidious knew about padme’s death while he could not possibly have known that. Unless... he had felt the lifeforce being absorbed by vader to survive. Maybe he even had a part in it himself.
-Once again Sidious, as vader asks about padme, sidious says “It seems, in your anger, you have killed her.”
In his anger. We all know anger is part of the dark side. What if sidious meant it as in ‘you have used your anger to kill her’?
-Right when the helmet gets put on, you can hear him say ‘Padme, help me’ very silently. Maybe he tried to reach out to her and, perhaps unknowingly, made her ‘help’ him with her own lifeforce.
-This would be a logical explanation to padme dying.

1206,Star killer base was a downgrade from the original Death Star.,"When Force Awakens was released, the new Mgguffin weapon of mass destruction was Starkiller base. Sure, the threat was grounded on how it could destroy several planets at once, pretty serious. Except it isn’t. The movie completely glosses over how millions or even billions of people were killed in a single firing. A mass genocide would have sparked outrage amongst the remaining planets, despite of any fear of annihilation. But instead, it seems that the Resistance against the First Order shrinks as time goes on. 

In contrast, the Death Star in Rogue One plays it very differently. When they destroy Jedha, they show prolonged panoramics of the aftereffect. The blast kills significant characters and leaves a scar on the character’s actions later. When the rebels land on Scariff, they yell “For Jedha!” It shows that despite the blast being smaller, it plays a deeper significance to the plot and setting of the movie

I dunno, maybe I’m overthinking it, but after rewatching the movies, Starkiller Base shows a good 2 seconds of destruction and does nothing but hasten the plot while the Death Star shows in depth what happens and how it effects the characters and extras.",StarWars,1562079071,yahboiJ3R,20,0,True,2019-07-02

2. Even if we assume that MF somehow got cloaking technology and forget about it not working in the first place, as we saw it during D'Qar evacuation... surely First Order will run decloaking scans all over the place. Especially after not finding anyone on the base they were besieging. 
3. Even if we assume that MF manages to jump into hyperspace before getting blown into pieces... hyperspace tracker is still a thing, right?

Much like, lets face it, some of the posts we see on this board can be very toxic. I am not talking about people who criticise the movies,  I have my own issues with TLJ but I still absolutely love this franchise but I think that on social media and among so called ""influencers"" the franchise I love is getting a lot of hate. 

It feels to me at times that this hate is like a bandwagon, people just want to jump on, it almost seems like hating on Star Wars is a ""cool"" thing to be doing. We had the solo boycott, we had all that nonsense about not being able to say youngling at Galaxies edge that turned out to be utter crap and then there was all that nonsense about not being able to decapitate in Fallen Order. It just feels like a lot of hate for the sake of hating, there is a difference I think between saying I didn't like TLJ and just spouting unrelenting hate because its trending will get some youtube clicks and a few likes or upvotes and a smattering of retweets. And so the hate spreads. 

This got me thinking though its is possible that the hate, the literal dark side of the internet slowly kills Star Wars as a result of this?

1255,Game Idea/Wish: Overkill's Rogue One (Co-Op Multiplayer Class FPS),"# Introduction:

After the events of Rogue One (2016) and a New Hope, leaders of the Rebellion have noticed the damage a small group of individuals can do. Knowing that despite blowing up the Death Star, the Empire still remains strong and thus the Rebellion still needs to hit it where they hurt. Thus, they formed a new Rogue One to strike back at the Empire. The concept in my head depicts them as a more intense version of the Spectres from Star Wars Rebels. 

# Gameplay Concept:

The reason I put Overkill in the title is because of Payday and Payday 2, where a small group of criminals rob banks in a class based shooter. So with Payday 2 in mind, I believe that they can effectively create a good Payday-style spec ops Star Wars game. So like Payday, you go on missions given by the Rebellion like stealing arms, tech, and credits or  assassinating Imperial officers. We can even have missions where we take down AT-AT's in their factory or an AT-AT in under repair. Most missions can be done either with Stealth or Loud (alerting the enemy), with others being purely Loud or Stealth. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Here is an example of how classes work in Payday 2](https://payday.fandom.com/wiki/Skills)

&amp;#x200B;

So just like Payday there will be four characters at launch:

**1. The Commando**

\- A very flexible character concept and can be anything from a Mandalorian to a Rebel 

\- A leader character that functions as a support class for other players. 

\- usually functions as a healer or a damage booster

&amp;#x200B;

**2. The Enforcer**

\- Preferably a large alien like a Wookie or a Lasat.

\- Brings the Heavy Weapons, ammo, and has the most Health.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. The Technician**

\- A very flexible character concept can be anyone

\- can also be an Astromech's consciousness placed inside a different and more mobile, droid body

&amp;#x200B;

**4. The Bounty Hunter**

1261,Disney's Star Wars Ignorance shown in it's merchandise for Galaxies Edge,"I am thrilled about Galaxies Edge, it sounds cool, looks amazing and I can't wait to go and try things out with the rides and such, but I can't help but feel that Disney shows their hand again at trying to ignore that the 6 prior movies and timeline ever existed. I'm not dumb. They have a movie to push and they want the new stuff to sell and stick, but the fact of the matter is that Star Wars is a multi-generational type of saga. Kids will grow up with the Resistance and first order (which personally I feel like we really haven't gotten a lot of deep connection to) but there are people who love the Clone Wars series, and others that grew up and wanted to join the Empire or the Rebellion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the land is supposed to be during this time period, but you can't tell me that there couldn't be a shop that is old armor? Or a pod racer shop? etc? I love Disney, but I just feel like they dig themselves their own holes by continuing to neglect that the saga has a history, and it's okay to honor that history as well. I mean heck, they continue to push Stich as some mainstay Disney character, it's not like there haven't been other movies that could take it's place. Anyone else notice this? Or maybe have visited and can tell me differently? I just look at the X-Wing outfits and think, man it would have been cool to get a T-65 helmet, but instead the ONLY option is the T-70.

• Leia is killed early on in the movie by the First Order, dealing another damaging blow to Kylo Ren’s mental state, and testing commitment to the dark side. 
• Matt Ryan’s alleged character will appear to Kylo at some point in the movie and reveal his plans to try and resurrect Palpatine. 
• After a force connection between Rey and Kylo about this, Luke appears to Rey and describes his experience with Palpatine and why she must prevent this from happening. And (most likely not, but hopefully) Anakin confronts Kylo as Darth Vader to do the same thing. 
• Kylo and Rey join forces like they did in TLJ, with an ultimate sacrifice from Kylo that sees his death, with parallels to Anakin/Vader in ROTJ. 
• (another unlikely one) but a scene towards the end of the movie which shows all members of the Skywaker family together in some form of afterlife, ascended world.
• Rey must now finish what Luke had set out to do after ROTJ, however using her own grey jedi teachings under the name of Skywalkers, something which has been highly speculated by large amounts of the community.

_(The Rise of Sidious) 
*To the tune of Idina Menzel's ""Let it Go""*

The snow blows white on Mygeeto tonight, not a footprint to be seen. 
A lifeless and icy wasteland, 
Where it looks like I will freeze. 
The Force is howling like a swirling storm inside, 
Couldn't keep it in, Father knows I tried. 
""Don't let them in, don't come near me""
But then I slaughtered my whole family
With some dark force I can't control, 
So I called Hego...

""Way to go, way to go, they can't hold you back anymore.""
""I don't know, I don't know, I've never felt like this before.""
""Power knows neither guilt nor shame, 
Now just come with me, and I could make you my new protege.""

Twenty short years later, the pieces are in place, 
To crumble the Republic, and wipe out the Jedi race. 
It's time to do what I must do, 
The revenge of Darth Bane's Rule of Two.
There's just one thing that's left to do: 
Kill the Muun...

Overthrow, overthrow, 
Old Plagueis has to die. 
He's too old, and too slow, 
Time to claim what's rightly mine. 
The galaxy is now mine to take,
Let the storm rage on...

My power flows through me like a rabid unchained beast, 
The Force bends to my will to shape reality as I please,
The future now sets down an unalterable path
And the whole galaxy will soon tremble at my wrath! 

The Jedi didn't know
I was the Dark Lord all along!
Let it show, let it grow,
Til they all bow to the strong.
So begins the age of Sith!
Let the storm rage on...

Now, this detail to me only means that Rey and Zorri will definitely meet and can't be conclusive on its own for a familial connection. 

However, I do have a few more observations, which I personally haven't seen considered by anyone anywhere. (though I could be wrong of course).

**So, to finally get to them:**

**FIRST** is [this just in] (https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/1134087/Star-Wars-9-Rey-parents-mother-theory-Zorri-Bliss-Keri-Russell) article, specifically its accompanying video material, in which producer Kathleen Kennedy mentions that the key word to EpIX will be **HOPE**, specifically **hopeful resolution**.

**SECOND** is Zorri Bliss's name. To me this name sounds somewhat incongruous with someone who's supposedly a Bounty Hunter inhabiting the supposedly villainous habitat that is supposedly the Thieves' Quarter. It's somewhat basic, somehow childish, sounds too naive and positive. Therefore, there ought to be some hidden meaning in the name. 

Curiously, **Zorri** is a word that means ""dawn"" or ""sunlight"" in most Slavic languages. So, translated, her name would become Dawn Bliss... Dawn of bliss... Dawn of... **HOPE**... **A NEW HOPE** ? Notice where this is going? Catch my drift? ;]

**THIRD** is the color of Zorri's suit which is, again, very un-Bounty Hunter, even very un-Star Wars. I think there's a meaning here too. **Purple** is a color which has traditionally and historically been associated with royalty. Royalty. Regal. Rey. ;]]

P.S. As a bonus, and a bit of jumping the shark on my part, [this promo poster] (https://i.redd.it/f8c2egek3oo21.jpg) could also be explicated to some extent.

1326,Question about Starkiller Base,"I am watching TFA again and just saw the scene on Starkiller Base when it fired and destroyed the planets in the Hosnian system.  You see Hux, Phasma and Kylo, and thousands of troops, watching as it fired.  They are close enough to the blast that it takes up a good portion of the horizon.  

Here's the question, being that close to that kind of energy firing for a sustained period of time, wouldn't they have all just instantly disintegrated?  I know it's fake science and it's a movie and blah blah, but it seems like the energy required to destroy an entire planet with just a splinter of the beam would decimate everything even remotely close to it.  Sure, the trees and immediate surrounding area are destroyed, but the radiant heat and energy wouldn't be contained to such a small area.  

This has probably been asked before, but I couldn't find it.  Just wondering if anyone else had the same thought or has any comments on this.  I read the entire entry on Wookiepedia and just reinforces that the dark/phantom energy and force necessary to create a hole in hyperspace would destroy a far larger area and everything in it.

1332,I think Han Solo is still alive. (Spoilers),"I don't know if anyone has already done this theory or not, and some of it may not be canon anymore (I'll explain), but I believe Han Solo is still alive. 

As I watched the movies, shows, and read the books I came to a profound realization: people who go down holes aren't dead. Some examples may jump to your mind immediately, but I'll give four primary examples - not going too obscure - of when characters go down holes (chasms, shafts, pits, etc.) but turn up later. 

Example one: Darth Maul. The man gets cut in half by Obi-Wan, falls down a shaft, and still manages to show up later in one of the cartoons and in the Solo movie. We all thought we'd seen the last of him when he fell down that shaft in two pieces. Alas, how could we have known?

Example two: Boba Fett. A fluke accident sends his jet pack on the fritz, causing him to go face first into Jabba's sail barge and tumbling neatly into the sarlacc pit. Now this is the sketchy one since the books are no longer canon, and I'm unaware of when the movie would've taken place. However, continuing on to support my point, Boba Fett managed to climb his way out of the sarlacc pit and go on to have more adventures.

Example three: Luke Skywalker. So we all know he gets his hand cut off, falls down the chute, and lives. Nobody really presumed he was dead since Darth Vader was the one who saw it happen, and he damn well knew Luke didn't die. BUT, he was still severely injured, fell down a hole, and lived. So I'm counting it. 

Last example: Darth Sidious. The Rise of Skywalker makes it (mostly) clear that the Sith master is still around. Whether through force ghost, essence transfer, or some other means, the guy is still around. I just want to point out that he was old, electrocuted, and tossed down a reactor shaft. Yet, he's back.

Thus, I come back to my point that Han Solo is still alive. He gets - lightly - stabbed through the heart and falls down into the Starkiller weapon. 

I know my theory has some holes, and my facts may be sketchy at best. I don't have the greatest of memories, and it's such a large universe. I'm just throwing my theory out there for debate.",StarWars,1559442582,badnom,22,0,True,2019-06-01

1342,"I know that I might not be the first one to have thought of this, but I kinda have a small theory about Episode IX. For anyone who hasn't seen all of the Original Trilogy and Sequel Star Wars movies yet, WARNING, THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS!","So we know that The Force Awakens represents A new Hope in the following ways:

* A force sensitive person living on a desert planet meets up with a droid and tries to take it back to the Resistance (the Rebel Alliance of the time).
* The Millenium Falcon makes its return to Star Wars, with Han Solo and Chewbacca eventually using it to go on a sabotage and rescue mission on Starkiller Base (the Death Star).
* The Resistance sends several groups of fighter pilots to take out Starkiller Base, with them facing off against enemy fighters and turbolasers. Eventually they perform a trench run through the oscillator and destroy the entire planet.

&amp;#x200B;

We also know that The Last Jedi represents The Empire Strikes Back in the following ways:

* It may not be exactly the same, but the First Order Fleet shows up in orbit of the planet that holds the Resistance's base and is about ready to destroy the Resistance. A battle then takes place (only this time it's in space), which sees the Resistance fully evacuate the base and flee somewhere else, even though they were tracked.
* You also have Rey seeking out and finding Luke Skywalker on another planet, and even though she initially asks him to help the Resistance, she eventually asks him to show her the ways of the force.
* I'm not really too familiar with this scene, but Luke is of course very old at this point and refuses to show her the ways of the force, thus showing him as a representation of Yoda. Eventually after seeing Yoda return and speaking with him about Rey, Yoda mentions how generations of Jedi live inside of her and how she may be their last hope (or something like that). This part could represent the conversation between either Luke and Obi-Wan or Yoda and Obi-Wan, where Yoda is represented as Obi-Wan.
* We also eventually have the Resistance make a stand against the First Order on another planet with an abandoned Rebel base, while they try to contact other allies for help. The base is in a cave system, with outer defenses and a trench line. The First Order sends in walkers to destroy their defenses, and the Resistance use speeders to attack them, which all clearly represents the Battle of Hoth. and of course they eventually escape again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now here's the main part of this post.**

Now I don't really have much to go on for comparing Episode IX to Return of the Jedi, but we do have this from the trailer and The Last Jedi:

* In the trailer, we see Rey on a desert planet once again. Maybe it's her home planet Jakku.
* We have one scene where there is some kind of battle taking place on a planet with a few trees, hopefully a forest. I know that a lot of planets have trees but again, I don't have much to go on.
* We see Lando Calrisian piloting the Millenium Falcon once again.
* We here the laughter of Emperor Palpetine at the end of the trailer.
* Also, in The Last Jedi, even though we didn't here a response, the Resistance did transmit an SOS signal from Crait just before they left. Let's not rule put the possibility that someone did here it and they eventually come to their aid in Episode IX. 

With all of this in mind, could this mean that Episode IX could have one big epic battle very similar to the Battle of Endor? With a forest planet, Palpetine watching Kylo Ren and Rey fighting, and Lando and the Resistance destroying a Second Starkiller Base?

&amp;#x200B;

1377,"A Rey Theory for The Rise of Skywalker: It's About Love, Not Blood","So let me preface this with some honesty, I'm not much of a fan theory person. While they can be fun creative exercises I find those who engage with them too much develop a ""missing the forest for the trees"" mentality with fiction. To me a story's satisfaction comes from its themes and how they reflect real life, while theory culture tends to reduce stories to puzzles that can only be satisfying once they are ""solved"". But since the teaser for The Rise of Skywalker came out there has been an idea brewing in my head about what the title means. initially I was a proponent of the ""Skywalker will become a title"" theory, which I've seen a decent amount of traction for. But eventually I had another idea that I haven't seen others consider. This came after some thought about the hopes and fears people have for the creative direction of the next film, especially after the events of The Last Jedi (short opinion: it has some serious pacing problems and doesn't know what to do with its characters of color, but it's not bad or good enough to warrant being some sort of battleground for Star Wars fandom). This theory also fits my appreciation for some thematic meat being attached to it. Also from here on out I’ll be writing as if this theory is true so sorry if it sounds like I’m speaking in certainties about what will happen in TROS, I honestly don’t know and I’m not sure if I want this to be what happens.


Rey’s identity was one of the big questions JJ Abrams put forward in The Force Awakens and it was seemingly answered by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Now with Abrams back to direct and co-write The Rise of Skywalker there’s the belief that he’ll undo what Johnson did. I don’t think that will happen but I do think Abrams could have his cake and eat it too. To cut to the chase, The Rise of Skywalker refers to Rey discovering her place in the Skywalker family. Abrams will reveal that Rey is a Skywalker, and specifically Luke Skywalker’s daughter, but she is a Skywalker by adoption rather than by blood. What Kylo told her about her parents being nobodies was true but only true about her biological parents. Luke and his wife (Zorri Bliss, the character played by Keri Russell who has been suspiciously absent from TROS press coverage) adopted a child for mundane and innocuous reasons. They were a loving family until the time of Kylo Ren’s attack on the Jedi Temple where Luke believed them to be among Kylo’s victims. Rey and her mother managed to escape to Jakku but Rey’s mother was separated from her when she was given to Unkar Plutt. Rey’s mother would become part of the criminal underworld under the alias Zorri Bliss, eventually able to track Rey down years later when she becomes notorious as a member of the Resistance. Rey, traumatized by Kylo’s attack and her mother seemingly abandoning her, would suppress the memories of much of her childhood. A grief-stricken Luke exiled himself to Ahch-To and severed his connection to the Force, making him unable to sense that his family was still alive or even sense that Rey was his daughter when they reunited years later. When the events of TFA happened Rey, Leia, and even Han could unconsciously sense that Rey is part of their family even if they couldn’t recognize her, which explains why Han and Leia were so quick to act as parental figures to her. 


The theme of this theory is that true strength in the Force does not come from someone’s genetic heritage or from The Force willing a particular individual to be powerful. Instead it is derived from those that you have loved in your life. If there’s anything the old Jedi were definitely wrong about it is their belief that love leaves one too vulnerable to the Dark Side to risk. They were even hypocritical about this because they only thought about romantic love when Jedi still formed friendships and family-like bonds amongst themselves and others. The Force flows through and connects every living being, and nothing connects people stronger than the forms love takes. Rey became strong in the Force during the events of TFA and TLJ because it coincided with her reunion with Han, Chewie, Leia, and Luke, rediscovering the love for people who were important to her as a child. She also gained strength from Finn, her first real friend, and it contributed to her being able to defeat Kylo in TFA. Meanwhile Dark Side users can’t understand this because they believe The Force is merely a resource to control and horde like Palpatine and/or it is meant only for those of a significant bloodline like Kylo. Love has always been one of the themes of Star Wars but it being explicitly tied to one’s strength in The Force would be a nice way to tie together Rey’s story with the Skywalker Saga.



TL;DR: Rey is not Luke’s biological daughter but his adopted daughter, Keri Russell’s character is her mother and Luke’s wife, true strength in The Force comes from love and not genetics or divine providence.",StarWars,1559540254,LLCoolZJ,7,0,True,2019-06-03

Theres no reason for instance that the Casino scene in 8 couldve taken place on many of the planets in tcw or rebels such as Ondoran. Itd be a connecting line throughout the franchise. Another possible example could be using Seelos (the planet Wrex lives on in rebels) instead of Crait, theres no reason these planets cant have some diverse biomes to give the movies what they need.

But what I think many will like is this mantra that popped up. IT was used by the Jedi Order before the fall of the sith and has fallen out of pratice but it goes

 ""light-dark and balance true. One is no greater than the others. Together they unite restore recenter and renew. I walk into the light and acknowledge the dark and find balance within ourselves""

One is no greater than the others ties into Yoda's comment about the Darkside being quicker but not stronger in ESB. Acknowledge the Dark and find balance has to do with accepting the dark within and while not giving in to it also no suppressing it to where it bubbles and festers. Acknowledge the emotion, deal with it, and let it pass instead of shoving it away. 

Unite, restore, recenter, and renew is odd since the Dark Side isn't known for its healing or calming techniques. Though I guess it means that by acknowledging your feelings you will be able to get over them and center yourself. 

I'm sure many will read this as a pro-grey jedi thing and its vauge enough to be read that way but I don't think it is. Its just showing that the old order used to be better in touch with its emotions than the current one. 

Also something else in here I liked is it showing another example that yes Jedi do need training to use the force (be it visualization, centering, connecting with the force, or practice actually putting that together and moving something with it) and that its not just faith alone that does it.",StarWars,1556742126,JakeSkywalkersGhost,9,4,True,2019-05-01

I find it interesting that this appears to be the case. I have a couple of ideas as to why.

Star Wars has been around for decades, thus causing, the fan base to maybe have wildly different tastes and expectations?

1443,"Why ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the greatest film of all time...","Why ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the greatest film of all time
VISUALS: After more than 30 years the effects of this movie are still unrivaled. The reason why they were so successful is not because they are ""new"" or ""the latest"", they work so well because of the unimaginably painstaking effort went into making this Galaxy Far Far Away feel real. In BTS footage it is apparent that there was an unrivaled sense of imagination and effort put in the effects.
STORY: The story of Empire is both original and classic all at once. This is because the journey of Luke and his Friends begins on a path that has legitimately unpredictable twists and turns. It is a damn shame that the Vader twist has been spoiled to hell, because on its own it works as possibly one of the best twists in film. Classic and original at once.
CHARACTERS: Luke, Vader, Han, Leia, Yoda, R2D2, Boba Fett, you probably know these characters like the back of your hand and for good reason. Almost each and every main character is the textbook example of memorable. Also Vader is the best villain...ever.
CINEMATOGRAPHY: The shots in this film are so well done and iconic that they can rival the best of the best in film history. Take the Luke vs Vader scene. Luke begins visually bright and vibrant. But once he enters the Cloud City chamber the tone and visuals grow darker. Darth Vader is submerged in shadows, as Luke joins him the darkness and commits the biggest sin in combat for a Jedi as he ignites his Lightsaber first. Timeless
WRITING: There are so many iconic lines in this film, that there is more than 1 line that is considered in the top 10 most iconic lines of all film history. ""No, I am your father."" ""No. Do or do not. There is no try."" ""I love you. I know."" ""Never tell the odds.""
CONCLUSION/TLDR: Due to the outstanding story, visuals, characters, and writing of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I believe it is the greatest film in history. It took an incredible film that was light and fun into much darker, more mature territory. There will be no other film ever like Empire because it is the first and best of it's kind.

1463,"Star Wars 9 Theory (Another one, I know...)","Despite most theories about Star Wars' stories never coming to fruition, it's still fun to speculate. So, I've thought awhile about Episode 9's title, the apparent return of Palpatine, and a number of other clues in the last movies. So this is what I think:  


""The Rise of Skywalker"" refers to the creation of the Chosen One and his family line through the manipulation of Darth Sidious. Anakin was born without a father and seen as fulfilling prophecy (i.e. bringing balance to the force). He eventually died seemingly fulfilling this prophecy by killing Sidious. However, the Force was never balanced after this and it again 'awakened'. Also, the show Rebels pushed the idea that Luke may be the Chosen One -- but he clearly didn't fulfill the prophecy either because he struggled against the darkness and eventually died as well with the Force still not being balanced. Now we have Rey and Kylo left. But the latter still struggles to accept the light, whereas the former accepts both the darkness and light (as shown in Ep. 8). Therefore, it seems that Rey may be the most qualified at this point to be the Chosen One.   


Furthermore, if Kylo was correct that her parents were ""nobodies"", this implies she may have been the result of a virgin birth as well -- which further implies that she is in fact a 'Skywalker' in the same way that Anakin was a Skywalker. And if Sidious was the one who created the Skywalker line, then Rey's ""father"" could technically be Sidious.   


That said, if Sidious is actually still alive, this makes Kylo much more complex than initially thought. Remember when he was speaking to Vader's mask and said ""I will finish what you started""? Well, what Kylo could be referring to here was Anakin's purpose to balance the Force. In this case, Kylo believe that his grandfather didn't succeed and thus it's up to him to still kill Sidious. In other words, Kylo is fighting his light side because he believes the darkness is the only way to really kill Sidious OR he needs to trick Sidious into believing that he is a dark Jedi. This may also explain his conflict with killing father and asking for his ""help"", because that was the only way to convince the Emperor that he wasn't a threat.   


Which leads us to Snoke. This theory actually makes Snoke's identity and death all the more meaningful. Because this means that Snoke may have merely been an apprentice of Sidious or a Sidious clone -- a secondary figure that needed to be killed to become Sidious' next apprentice so as to get closer to him and kill him as well. This is in fact the same way that Anakin got closer to Sidious, by killing Count Dooku (although that wasn't his intention at the time). So maybe Kylo was merely following the script and trying to get closer and closer to the Emperor. This may also explain why he's never tried to kill Rey and only wanted to turn her -- because he knows that he needs her to complete his mission.   


Kylo may also know he's going to die and that he's irredeemable, but he's acting as a scapegoat to allow Rey the opportunity to fulfill the prophecy once and for all.",StarWars,1556765598,AsadOfAndalus,1,0,True,2019-05-01
1464,In defense of Attack of the Clones. Let's talk!,"Having recently bought the Complete Saga on Blu-ray, I decided to re-watch the prequels. I've seen a number of posts defending The Phantom Menace, and I wholeheartedly agree with the thoughts provided. Yes, the dialogue was a little tacky at times, the CGI was a bit rough around the edges and the Jar Jar poop jokes were completely inexcusable. However, the CGI was a product of its time and many of the actors were young, with Star Wars being an entirely new ball-game for them. The Phantom Menace added huge layers and expanded Star Wars in a way that took old fans through a trip down nostalgia lane, whilst engaging new fans with the universe that is star wars. I still remember the first time I watched the pod races. It was extremely exciting. 

Moving on to Attack of the Clones. 

I strongly believe that the cinematography in this episode is some of the strongest in the saga. In particular, the senate scenes truly provide perspective into the scale of the Star Wars galaxy and the level of influence that Palpatine controls in manipulating other systems to align with his plans. I am also particularly fond of the scene with Anakin and Palpatine in his office. It is a fantastic fore-shadowing of what is to come in ROTS, as well as demonstrating that Palpatine is truly Anakin's puppet-master, even though he does not fully realise it. 

Another aspect I like is that all of the side-plots actually make sense and serve a purpose. Anakin attempting to find and save his mother showed us that he could not let go of attachments, and provided significant motivation for wanting to save Padme in ROTS. It also explained how Luke had family on Tatooine and why Owen and Beru wanted to keep his past from him so that he could live a more simple childhood. Obi-Wan tracking down Jango Fett and discovering The Clone Army was extremely useful in showing that the Jedi Council did not want to start the war, but had little choice other than to lead the Clones for the purpose of creating resistance against the Trade Federation and protecting innocent galactic systems from their control. However, this was all in the name of Palpatine's attempts to destabilize the galaxy and assume control of what would become The Empire. 

Importantly, Attack of the Clones set the stage for The Clone Wars series, which gave depth to the prequels that 2 movies could not. 

There is more that I could talk about, and I really want to hear your opinions, so I will finish with mentioning my favourite and probably one of the most meaningful scenes in the movies. That is, of course, the scene with Obi-Wan and Count Dooku on Geonosis before the Battle of Geonosis. 

I believe this scene is incredibly powerful in demonstrating the depth of Dooku as a character and the nuances of Christopher Lee's performance. What we gain from this is that Dooku is not purely evil and creating war for the sake of war, but he is a capable and logical free-thinker and negotiator, who left the Jedi due to his disagreement with their idealistic views. He truly did sympathise with the Jedi, but would not let that compromise his plans. Out of all the Sith, he is the Sith with a heart. 

Ultimately, I watched Episode II as a kid for the lightsabers and explosions. Now, I can appreciate the plot and the character motivations.",StarWars,1556766457,hazelprophecy,0,1,True,2019-05-01

1478,A request from the community for a small school club,"This post is mod approved.

Hello fellow Star Wars enthusiasts. I work at a college for students with disabilities in the UK. There are a few clubs that are completely voluntary for staff to run and administer such as Star Wars, Anime club, Harry Potter, etc. Unfortunately before Easter break the Star Wars club had their Blu-Ray and DVD collection stolen and a plea was put out to staff to see if a student had taken them without realising they were the clubs but they were not returned. This has been pretty devastating for the students as they had fundraised to purchase them. It was pretty heartbreaking for me honestly, I'm just on the admin team but when I read the email it made me think of all the times Redditors have helped out people down on their luck and I hoped maybe they could show our students that there are plenty of kind, helpful people out there. So if you are in the UK/Europe and you have some spare Star Wars stuff that you'd like to donate, let me know please. I'll attach the email that was sent by the teaching assistant who runs the club below. Also just saying, I hear the Harry Potter club is  very popular... so show them up.

&gt;Hello,

&gt;We are extremely disappointed that we have returned after the Easter holidays and our missing DVDs and Blu Rays haven't been returned. As you can imagine, all of us are heartbroken and frustrated that somebody came into the room, took them without our knowledge and hasn't returned them. In November when (staff) asked us if wanted to enter the Dragon's Den competition, we said that we would like to ask for money to buy the original saga on Blu Ray as they have audio description for (3 students). We also completed our film collection with a couple of DVDs. We all worked hard creating our proposal and then presenting it to the Dragons and when (staff) told us that we had been given the money we were very happy. We now have no films to watch, apart from Rogue One thanks to Netflix and although we have games to play and other activities to do, it is nice to be able to chill out and watch our favourite films. 

&gt; If anyone has any of the films (with audio description) that we can borrow until we can re-buy some, we would be grateful to the Death Star and back.

1484,How Star Wars could learn from Game of Thrones,"Spoilers for Game of Thrones!!! 

Note: I talk about Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Don’t hate me please


  Now I love, *love* Star Wars it’s introduced some of the best fictional characters like Han Solo, Princess Leia, and who can forget Darth Vader? But one thing that’s always bothered me is how black and white the movies and shows could be and the ridiculous plot armor, and yes I’m aware it’s suppose to be more family friendly but hear me out

the best example is(please don’t hate me) Luke Skywalker. He’s a good character, but he’s a little too good. Luke never really sees the dark side within him until Return of the Jedi and even then that was like a second. Luke is the embodiment of purity and goodness but it hurts his character, he feels very fictional until the Last Jedi where we see a broken Luke who tapped into the dark side and unintentionally created Kylo Ren and his goons. To me at least it was great to see him at his lowest of lows because that happens to everyone people have regret and guilt and Luke had none of that in the original trilogy so it was nice to see that because he felt more like a normal person

But what does the Luke and the Last Jedi have to do with Game of Thrones?

Well it’s a show with little to no plot armor for the characters and most of the people in the show are not as black and white as Star Wars characters. Take one of my favorite characters, Jamie Lannister, yes the guy who sleeps with his deranged sister(disclaimer I do not promote insest) in the first episode he pushes a kid out the window and crippled him in hopes that no one would find out his secret relationship with his sister, Cersei. For the rest of the season all I thought about him was “God damnit I hate you and die in a hole you arrogant bastard!” Then along came his arch with Brianne of Tarth where he finds good in himself and evolves into less of a villainous knight and more of a human like character with a good side but some flaws until season 8 where he finally ends his affair with Cersei and joins the good guys as they fight the Night King and his army of the dead

Another reason I love the show is because of the lack of plot armor. The show is not afraid of killing off some great characters like Rob Stark, Jorah Mormont and the direwolves(I sweat someone is cutting a whole lot of onions when stuff like that happens) and no one is safe, the tension is real and it’s great. Now take Star Wars where everyone is gonna be safe. Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando,Rey, Finn, Poe and all those guys are safe until the very end. But imagine if during the movie *bam* Finn gets offed by a stormtrooper of Kylo Ren cuts down Poe showing no one is safe really. However unfortunately something like this probably won’t happen. Then it hit me

Have a darker, more gritty Star Wars show 

A live action Star Wars series set up more for adults would be fun to see wouldn’t it? And if it was set up similar to Game of Thrones then you’re favorite characters would never be safe and there would be real suspense

As much as I may hate the movie though, there are plenty of folks who have felt the total opposite, and while I could respect their opinion I could never really understand why they arrived at it.  But I think Avengers: Endgame has given me a glimpse as to why.

Simply put, Endgame is also a movie with some sloppy choices and gaping plot holes.  They may not leap out at you at first, but after a few viewings they kinda smack you in the face.

1504,Why I like all Star Wars media.,"Ok I'll go out and say it I did not mind Last Jedi It probably ranks higher than Phantom Menace for me not as in story but more if I had to choose to watch one or the other I would choose Last Jedi. However I fully understand the flaws and gripes people have with any piece of Star Wars media and you are more than welcome to have your own opinion.

Now with that out of the way, why do I like all of the things Star Wars has brought out? Simply because the universe as a whole feels alot more cohesive and rich to me any ways. I may have not liked characters like L3 from Solo but her impact on the Falcon was nice to see and I felt that's where it had to be.

In short I may not like everything star wars has to offer but no matter what it is I appreciate that it's there so that one day I can show my children the wonders of Star Wars.",StarWars,1556816095,garmdian,8,7,True,2019-05-02

1515,Rose was an Awesomely written character and I LOVED her work.,"Seriously, most people won't admit it, but deep down, whether they realise it or not, they hate an ethnic minority female in Star Wars.  

&amp;#x200B;

Where do I begin? 

&amp;#x200B;

Luke said to Rey, that the light won't die without the Jedi, and Rose's character was designed to be a testament to that. Another big theme is the idea of not needing a legacy to be someone. Rey, a scavenger from Jakku is now the Last Jedi, and saved the galaxy by convincing Luke to return. Ben, a Skywalker AND a Solo said fuck that and paved his own way. The movie even ended with a stable boy turning out to have the force and taking inspiration from Luke's sacrifice and the resistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was actually just fine. The ""don't fight what you hate, save what you love"" quote was so beautiful , and epitomises why the light wont die with the Jedi, therefore adding validity to Luke's claim. The girl was never excessively vengeful after the F.O enslaved her and Paige as kids, and basically killed her sister. Her inspiring that resistance kid alongside Luke's story is what will rebuild the rebellion. ""Now it's worth it"" after freeing the fathiers is consistent what her character was written for, and embodies what the Jedi SHOULD have been. The Jedi in the prequels didn't give a sh\*t about helping people or tatoiine's slavery. The girl was a janitor who eventually rose (pun not intended) to greatness by playing a part in the war. If you have criticisms of the Finn/Rose subplot, that really shouldn't be directed solely at her. 

&amp;#x200B;

And onto her sacrifice. It was heroic AF. Poe OPENLY said it's too late to take out the cannon. Finn would have died for nothing. Within the story this is FACT. Look at Finn's ship as he was heading into it. Arguing against a detail like that is idiotic as hell. Finn would have died for nothing, and she saved his ass, because Finn was getting too caught up in revenge and acted mindlessly as a result.   

&amp;#x200B;

Their romance wasn't even that forced. Upon their first meeting, she fangirled over him because she respected him renouncing the first order, so it's was obvious from the offset. Plus she was grieving over her sister's death, so naturally became attached to Finn.  Whilst it's not a textbook romance, that doesn't make it badly written. ""tHE kIss wAS FoRCeD"" - she just risked her life to save him, come on guys.

&amp;#x200B;

It might be Star Wars, but not EVERYONE can be the badass, and badassery isn't needed all the time (as Leia said herself). Rose played the support role.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really can go on. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's ironic, a character that's so pure and embodies the light to its fullest, gets hated on and bullied in real life, because her actor wanted to put food on her table and move up in her career.",StarWars,1556825873,Pyramaniac,42,0,True,2019-05-02

Have it almost exclusively set in Mandalorian space with Mandalore and Concordia and Concord Dawn and Krownest. Bring back some other Mandalorian planets from legends like Phindar and Ordo and Mandallia etc.

We could see the clans and houses. Like House Vizsla with Clan Wren and Clan Saxon under them. Clan Fett and Clan Skirata. House Kryze as well.

1567,How to run a planetary blockade,We see in rebels that when they go up against a planetary blockade they usually lose.  There is a really simple way to get past a planetary blockade that they seem to be overlooking.  Delay dropping out of hyperspace until your in the atmosphere.  Han solo did this in the force awakens.  So why isn't this used more often.  True you risk hitting a star destroyer but it's far more likely you would crash into the ground.  Still the odds are better then taking on a group of star destroyers head on.  As desperate as the rebels are you would think you would see them use strategies like this.  As for getting past a blockade after leaving a planet's surface there is way to do it.  Do a blind jump into hyperspace.  Space is mostly empty so the chances of you hitting something are negligible.  Drop out of hyperspace after a few seconds and then calculate your next jump and be on your way.  So I just find it ridiculous that the rebels would try to engage imperial ships on the blockade instead of using these methods of getting past them.,StarWars,1554110859,WaveMonkey,4,1,True,2019-04-01

1579,what do you like about the empire?,"1) they are definitely the bad guys by far:

\- destroy planets to get rid of some rebels or to kill the slaves who built their weapons and thus getting rid of witnesses

\- they are making horrible experiments on wookies or other species (turn them into cyborgs or zombies)

\- threaten some people family so they join the stormtroopers

\- kill officers to show example

\- kill civilians to show example

\- are extremely racist again any non-humans

\- make a lot of propaganda so that the people shut up and stay head down

\- they make so much bad things that young ones who never knew the republic were ready to give their life to know freedom

&amp;#x200B;

2) they suck a lot:

\- lost two deaths stars because of their arrogance

\- their vehicles and ships are garbage. They only inspire fear but at-at can be brought down by a rope and a small ship, the two legs one can be destroyed by two logs throw fast enough at them and their cruisers can be easily paralyzed or destroyed if you target the shield generators then the command post

\- the stormtroopers have plastic armor (I was laughing at their armors even when I was a kid)  because they can be knocked down, stay close to each others in corridor to die more easily and cannot shot right. I read the joke who say that stormtroopers can shot right and were just bluffing but &lt;i don't understand why they didn't shot leia and co while vader had luke and why in endor they were only warning shot against the rebels and the ewoks

\- at the beginning of the empire the rebellion was starting because there was a dictatorship under the galaxy

&amp;#x200B;

3) they only last 20 years while the republic lasted 1000 years and palpatine get thrown like garbage by vader

1586,"Ideal Episode 9 ""Heir to the Empire""","I have put a lot of time into thinking how Episode 9 could make all star wars fans happy. I believe I have been able to come up with a solution while still intending to keep the story focused on new characters. Some names I use from the old republic era are place holder names. I'm also using some characters from the empire and making new from the unknown regions. The Form of the film is very reminiscent of that of The Godfather Part II, where there are long flashback sequences. I tried to summarize it the best I can for everyone else's sanity. 

The story opens a few days after episode 8 (not to worry this is only temporary there will be a time jump after the opening scene), Crait has become a staging are while The Supremacy is under repair. The super star destroyer eclipse (exactly as it is from legends and name dropped in aftermath) appears and a sith empire era shuttle, flies towards the under construction supremacy. (just realized how much this is like 6). The shuttle lands and 3 figures get out. One dressed up in garments from the old republic cinematic with the two brothers, this will be the stories main antagonist. Behind is the second main antagonist, Grand Admiral Thrawn, who will be the main force against the resistance. Then there is grand admiral Rae Sloane. The figure in robes is in essence Arcann. (Brief note on casting, Arcann-Prisoner's Jake Gyllenhaal, Thrawn-Lars Mikkelsen (from rebels), Viola Davis as Sloane since she would be far older by this point.

 They go to the thrown room. Arcann immediately knows what has transpired. He refers to Rey as Vaylin to Hux and Kylo. He kills Hux for his failure in stopping the resistance fleet (Can't think of a good way to fix Hux's character). Arcann is here to take back the first order. He goes on a mission for a month and the first order goes to crap(since the films took place over a few days this explains his absence without a need to mention him). The new red storm trooper brigade about 20 raise blasters on Arcann who instantly kills all of them through the force. Kylo has a new royal guard squad who block Arcann and he threatens to kill arcann. In the style of the fight when Tirall broke vaylin out, Arcann cuts down all of Kylo's guard. Kylo ignites his saber and Arcann ignites his. This will result in a fight or a cut to a flashback, if the fight happens the flashback would happen afterwards.

The flashback is practically the Arcann and Thexan cinematic. The republic forces and sith are replaced with rebels and storm troopers from the last days of the empire. Snoke is Vitiate for this post. He had an empire of force wielders in the unknown regions while this was all going on. Arcann and Thexan travel to a planet to extract and HVT, Rae Sloane, who was captured by the Empire for her choices on the battle of Jakku. The rebellion is charging the base with Luke and a very young Ben Solo. Arcann and thexan land in front of the rebels with special forces troops. Extract Rae and Thexan talks with Luke and Ben. Luke played by Sebastian Stan. Arcann hates Luke for some reason and is held back. When arriving back on the Supremacy, which is still around. Arcann tries to kill Snoke, killing Thexan in the fight. 

Cut to six months to a year after the battle of Crait. Kylo Ren is on the run and has a robotic arm from the fight he lost with arcann, he is being tracked by the knights of ren and they closed in on him. He kills two and escapes finally contacting Rey (Vaylin) claiming he's lost the first order and knows that Rey is not a nobody. In the mean time admiral Jade portrayed by Keri Russell (Nod to Jade Skywalker but no relation to the family), is attempting to reform the republic democracy. This is the main mission of the side characters besides Rey. They are trying to rebuild the republic while Thrawn and Sloane track them them down. Arcann and the Knights of Ren are tracking Kylo and Rey. 

Lando comes into play with Jade's character but is ultimately they serve to establish the politics of the new series which was missing in the firs two films. I know this can be a soar subject from the prequels but is integral to story and world building. More of a Octavian/Augustus emperorship has taken over the galaxy with Arcann, since the first order wiped out the new republic. Kylo finally returns to the resistance and is immediately locked up and they plan to try him for war crimes. Kylo then reveals Rey's true backstory.

This flashback is the old republic Vaylin cinematic in essence. Replace Tirall with Arcann as the older brother to this girl Vaylin. He's training her in combat when she uses the force and Snoke sees. Snoke trains her in a quick montage over a period of time. Arcann has killed thexan at this point and he wishes to get Vaylin out of Snokes grasp, so she can live her own life not being a slave like he was. He breaks vaylin out with the help of bounty hunters. (Rey is still very young so this takes place not long after the battle of Jakku. Some favorites such as Bossk and maybe Dengar can help Arcann rescue her. Even Kix the last clone trooper. Excuse me if something has happened with them in canon and this is not possible) They get her on the shuttle and Arcann uses a mind wipe power on Rey, but her training is still in the back of her head waiting to be awakened. The shuttle takes off and Arcann begins to walk towards Snoke. Snoke is ""very handsome"" and dressed like vitiate. They battle wounding Arcann into his old republic look, and making Snoke appear as he does in 7 and 8. 

Rey says they must go and rescue her brother. She believes he can be turned. The rebellion has gained a lot of momentum at this point. This yields Rey's main flaw. She thinks she can turn her brother whereas Arcann has been corrupted fully by snoke and wishes to kill her and Kylo. Rey is being selfish, saving Arcann would hurt the republic, much like a corrupt emperor would in Roman times, which is why I wish to explore that as the political system. Arcann has become truly evil after his duel with snoke all those years ago. Jade suggests the rebellion launches a Caesar tactic (how he took over mid winter completely unexpected)  against the first order. They keep growing powerful and the rebels have the ability to confront both of the first order capital ships at once. The first order would not expect the supremacy and the eclipse to be engaged at the same time. Kylo convinces Rey to bring him to fight Arcann since he is too powerful on her own.

A huge space battle ensues with the first order immediately put on the defensive. Thrawn immediately begins to prove his tactical genius and starts to hurt the resistance fleet. Rae Sloane ends on the supremacy to repel an assault led by Poe and Finn to gain access to the Supremacy's weapon system and turn it against the first order fleet. Rey and Ben (he is no longer Kylo at this point, they also share a kiss before going, yeah I don't mind Reylo that much) board the Eclipse to draw Arcann and the Knights of Ren away from the battle. The knights of ren surprise Finn and Poe on the Supremacy, making their assault harder. Rey walks up to Arcann and this is her first time seeing her brother since her mind was wiped. It's an emotional moment for both and right as Arcann is about to hand her his lightsaber, he sees Ben, making him enraged for killing his father. (just realized this is the first I mentioned Arcann is Snoke's son). He may have hated Snoke but he was still his father. He pushes Rey to the side and charges Ben. Rey attacks Arcann, a fight ensues. 

Lando, Jade, and Admiral Antilles (who has his own Super Star Destroyer, nod to legends) are starting to fight the defensive. Thrawns tactics are overwhelming for the rebellion generals. A spec ops team manages to make it to the bridge and take control of the weapons of the supremacy while Finn and Poe and the other rebels hold them in the ship. (There's a lot of battles going on across the supremacy but for time sake and writing they are not mentioned). The Supremacy's weapons are turned against the first order fleet. Through no fault of his own Thrawn is losing. Rae Sloane has fled to the Eclipse were her and Thrawn throw around the blame. Thrawn goes to sit down on his thrown, Sloane walks to the front of the bridge. A vibro blade is then sent through Thrawns heart from behind, and Rae Sloane is shot in the back. Thrawn says his famous last words. Appears either Rukh or Galius Rax. (Rukh for legends constancy, although I believe he is killed in rebels, can't remember. Galius Rax was thought to be dead when Rae Sloane killed him on Jakku, he would be played by Andrew Garfield). His reasoning is both are traitors to Palpatines vision after his death.

Finn and Poe win the battle on the Supremacy. Admiral Antilles, Lando, and Jade are almost done mopping up the first order forces. The last are scattered throughout the Supremacy, and those still aboard the Eclipse. The fight between Rey and Arcann and Ben has come to a close. Ben is on the floor along with Arcann, with Rey in power, she must choose. Her brother or new found friend and love... sorry if you hate Reylo. He chooses to side with Ben and deal the final blow to Arcann. Arcann has Rey goes to strike launches his saber with the force into Ben, Rey kills him on the follow through. She runs to Ben who throughout the fight saved her. These are details not mentioned earlier for time but he saved Rey numerous times in the fight. He also gave the intel to attack the Fleet. Ben has redeemed himself and dies in Rey's arms. She escapes and the Rebellion blows the Eclipse apart. They have won and the legend of Ben Solo has been told throughout the galaxy. The Skywalker legacy has ended. 

If you've made it this far, that means a lot and thank you. I would love to hear all of your feedback. I left out certain characters such as Rose, DJ, Maz. I didn't touch Leia because in all honest that is a character I do not know how to work into this story with Carrie Fisher's passing. I used Old Republic names as place holders, I'm bad when it comes to Star Wars names. I did not do too much extensive canon research for this. The Galius reveal is more for hardcore fans, the subplot is ended rather quickly. I tried my best to avoid being a copy of 6 and having a MacGuffin. The three battles at the end is something I could not find a work around for with excluding a lot of characters. I would love to see people take certain elements of what I've laid out and include their ideas, or maybe work around the 3 battles. I figured having them fight on a ship with the objective to take it over is different enough from jedi, two super star destroyers as the objectives rather than the death star. Do not have a place for the final duel between Rey, Ben and Arcann to take place, would love to hear suggestions. I hope you guys enjoyed my fun fan theory.

Headcanon example: 

In a deleted episode of Star Wars the Clone Wars, the Death Star's green, huge crystal is transported to Sidious.

In Star Wars the Force Unleashed, Galen Marek destroys the Death Star's Crystal. It takes 20 years to complete the First Death Star, because of the damage done by Galen Marek, while he was aboard the Death Star.

In Star Wars Rebels, yet again a crytal is delivered to Sidious, to replace the one destroyed by Galen Marek.

In Star Wars Rebels, Vader is missing most of the time instead of dealing with Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus, because he has to deal with the the whole Galen Marek/Starkiller mess, which is a much larger threat. Instead Thrawn is sent to deal with the Rebellion, created by Galen Marek.

The Planet Scarif, which has the Death Star plans, is Lehon, because of the Planets' past connection with the Star Forge.

First is the 212th. Should be fairly obvious why; led by the best Jedi (no debates) and our lord and savior Obi-Wan. I also am fond of how level-headed Cody seemed to be, although this could also come around to bite the battalion in the rear, as it also seemed he was very very “by the book” and orthodox (although I haven’t read any of the books, so I can’t confirm if this has been disproven).

My second choice would probably be the 104th “Wolfpack”. Plo’s Bros. I loved the aesthetic, as well as the chemistry between Plo-Koon and his clones. Although we didn’t see much of them throughout the animated series (may change with the new episodes coming), it seemed he actually cared about the men under his command and like he was very close with them. Although we didn’t see much of Wolfe in command during battle, it’s clear to me that the man is a warrior; he lost an eye and just decided to slap a cybernetic in there and continue to fight in the field.

1620,In Extended Lore Did Clones Have Multiple Sets Of Armour Or Ability To Repaint Camouflage?,"Hello there, I was thinking about this while watching Eckharts Ladders video on the first year of the Clone Wars, in real life it seems likely the original Clone Trooper armour is white because the Stormtrooper armour was white in The OT making it easily identifiable for a mass audience but it also doesn't quite make sense.

The Stormtroopers wore mostly white to amplify the presence of The Empire in policing duties and impose uniformity across the ranks, apart from The Yuuzhan Vong in the distance they didn't really have any opponents left in the galaxy who could take them on in a traditional full scale war.

But The Clone Troopers fought across dozens of different environments against enemies who in many cases had superior numbers, it makes sense in the film and shows for us to see recognizable characters/units like Cody but if you really think about it in most environments even if you add a little colour the white armour such as The 212 and 501st wear would stick out rather badly.

So I was wondering if off camera units changed armour or had the ability to repaint it for different situations between missions? even when they started specializing surely they wouldn't have had enough troopers and fleets to hold behind for different biomes ""Master Yoda, we require reinforcements on Hoth"", ""Go I cannot, troops I have, only with camouflage of the forest, suicidal that is""",StarWars,1554189204,Attican101,2,1,True,2019-04-02

1635,Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Skywalker,"First, where i'm coming from. Always liked The Force Awakens and will watch it any day with zero issue. I've never been hung up on the ST and think it was a very well-made film.

And then The Lost Jedi happened. Its like Rainy(I won't even say his name properly) was given a room full of toys, and rather than playing with them, he said 'nope! These aren't the toys I want to play with, and certainly not the toys you're looking for!', and simply set them all on fire. What he then put out was one of the dumbest, most inane pieces of crap in movie history. Its really easy to set stuff on fire, its harder to actually make something worth watching. And Shakespeare, he is not. Since the theatrical run, I tried just once to watch The Lost Jedi on Netflix to see if distance would help... it didn't. I made it about halfway through and its the one Saga movie that I absolutely cannot sit through. Its that bad.

Anyways, after wrecking the franchise, the damage collided into Solo and we got the first Star Wars Bomb in movie history. And here we are… with a dead IP that Disney is getting set to drop at least 100 mega-large in promotion to try to resuscitate between now and release in mid-December.

So how to pick up the pieces? First, the rumors. 

If its a Reylo shipper paradise just RIP. There is no saving it. 

If its the last episode of the Saga just RIP, there is no saving it. 

Also, take yourself out back and flog yourself for thinking it would actually be the last episode of The Saga... there is far more dead horse beating Disney is willing to do to suck this series dry).

Now, what comes is how you get this shit back on track.. and imo likely to be consisting of Abrams largely ditching Whatever That Was in 8 for how he originally conceived of this trilogy via outline. In essence, he's going to take anything Rainy did, and largely set it on fire.

To be clear, I don't think any of this will actually work because the audience just doesn't trust Star Wars anymore. So zigging to the zagging to the zigging is likely to just end with the franchise buried. If they wanted to do this, actually following the Abrams Outline and actually following a plan to get the audience to where you need them to go is in order. You would have also needed a super-producer Feige-type that can keep everything. 

Instead, they hired Kathleen Kennedy.

So.. the actual meat and potatoes. Make no mistake this is all theory and speculation on my part born out of what i'd like to see. As such, in my opinion, certain things have to happen.

1) Rey is a Skywalker. Daughter of Anakin, Sister to Luke. If you actually follow the history to its earliest days with Lucas, this is that origin. You get there via the Emperor and IVF. This can also be an explanation as to why Force-positives are popping up around the galaxy.

2) The Emperor is not dead. Palpatine sure is dead. But The Emperor is alive in some form or another. I'm sure this was intended to be Snoke, but Rainy didn't like that apparently. Oh wall, some magic force cave somewhere or another and wave some hands… it'll just be something else. By the end of 9, he should be inside Kylo Ren, having 'killed' the personality of Ben Solo, 'The Last Skywalker' the people think the title is about.

3) Rey, the real Last Skywalker, after the Big Revelation, needs to get destroyed both physically and mentally by Ren as Emperor at the end of the film... and barely makes it out alive.

Basically, you end 9 with everything going up in flames, the Emperor taking over the galaxy once more, and Rey &amp; Friends running for their lives to the Rim. End Credits.

If done properly, it should wreck people. Rey takes her fall, the big bad comes back, and you can pretty much work out where the build back in 10-12 for the big victory. Because, you know, its Star Wars. Our hero, faced with overwhelming odds comes back at some point later to find a way to bring peace to the galaxy and balance to the force. Yadda yadda. 

She loses, so she can win. If she doesn't lose, if she doesn't get drawn low to allow the audience to invest in the character as a true hero... then who the f cares?

But hey... maybe the rumors are true. Maybe Reylo goes off into the sunset and she makes Force Babies. Maybe they end the Skywalker Saga. IDK. But the above is the only way I can see them actually getting it back on track to end the ST. 

Ren as Emperor, a destroyed Rey &amp; Friends on the run, The Galaxy in Darkness. Out of that catharsis, you might actually have something with 10-12.

I want to thank everyone who have worked on this project, and helped it reach this point. 

Thank you u/KnifeOfPi2 for your wonderful translation work. 

A big thank you to our main cast: u/Sylarjr (Luke Skywalker), u/DarthDementous (Han Solo, C-3PO and Tarkin), u/OpheliaBloodstone (Princess Leia), u/Rivercast (Ben Kenobi) and u/TomSthePoster (Darth Vader).

Finally, thank you u/TheThirdGathers for making the dub which inspired this project. And wherever you are, thank you Jeremy Winterson for finding *Backstroke of the West* in the first place. You started this whole mess, and we couldn't be more happy about it.

Remember to stay through the credits. There's a fun little outtake at the end.

Our next project after this one will be the sequel, *The Counterattack Collection.* However, a rarely seen interquel is also in the works. More about that later.

Until then, may the force *and* the wish power be with you, always.

1651,Kenobi movie: important scenes,"If you have seen Ewan McGregor's work in Last Days in the Desert, ( https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3513054/ ), then you see how effective McGregor  could act out meaningful and dramatic action in a desert (for our purposes, he would be Obi Wan, not Jesus, and it would be on Tatooine, not the Middle East).

Taking place between episode 3 and 4, this movie could cover a lot of new material as well as bring redemption to a lot of plot hole issues I felt Episode 2 and 3 did not offer. Essentially, I want Obi Wan to be 10-20 years or so into Force depression, in hiding, far away on Tatooine. He has failed to meditate the pain away of the Jedi extermination, Padme's death (who it will be revealed he DID have feelings for, but always treated instead as a sister), and the betrayal of Anakin, taking far too much culpability for his apprentice's fall and the ensuing excessive tragedy which followed it.

He rejects his past, calls himself Ben. He has an addiction to fermented space cow milk that he uses to take the edge off, but it doesn't work. He starts to drown out the Yoda and Qui Gon ghost talks that attempt to absolve him of his guilt. He doesn't believe their ""everything happens for a reason,"" or, ""balance to the force comes in many ways,"" or, ""let go of your emotions and find peace,"" trash. That stuff doesn't work anymore because the pain is still there and the loss hurts too much. He even starts having hallucinations of those Force ghost conversations and it's a real shitshow for his mind.

So amidst all this, bring back Hayden Christensen to reprise his role. He would be the Light-side force ghost of Anakin, who ""died"" when Darth Vader killed him, a line Obi Wan later uses in episode 4. But at this point, his Force ghost has amnesia and is trying to find answers, and is equally or surpassingly as depressed as Kenobi. He can't believe he would do what Darth Vader did, but he can't undo it. Kenobi thinks this is a hallucination but ironically tries to console his friend.

They argue a lot and there's a lot of screaming and stuff about how they failed one another. This is where Anakin brings up the lingering looks Obi Wan gave Padme back in the day, the times when Obi Wan didn't provide enough/the right kind of wisdom and direction in how he handled his emotional outburst and immaturity. How Obi Wan had secretly pursued romance and got away with it (a separate story), but how he didn't help Anakin walk the grey Jedi line successfully. Stuff like that.

Throughout this, Kenobi also goes on sort of these drunken kung fu master escapades to save the local townships and passersby from the various threats which Tatooine presents them. Perhaps he even skirts the darkness himself, maybe almost. cutting down a Sandpeople village in anger, but being persuaded away by Hayden Christensen.

Eventually, this all culminates in Owen needing to flee out of fear his cover has been blown, and finding Obi Wan on Tatooine to seek his help. Owen and his wife basically see Old Crazy Ben, drunken kung fu grey jedi warrior, and reluctantly receive his help to stop the threat, maybe a bounty hunter that had discovered them, and hide again and resume their lives, attempting to raise Luke Skywalker and keep him safe.

When Kenobi saves young Luke, it's like he realizes his purpose isn't completely lost. He and Force ghost Anakin make peace. Ben still has a purpose. He hangs out nearby for many more years and awaits Luke's enlightenment or more danger coming after him. He returns to the traditional Jedi ways and meditations.

There can be other stuff too, but this all lets me think about some of the interpersonal lacking that episode 2 and 3 had, and expounds nicely on character developments that the original trilogy episodes hint at but don't explain sufficiently.",StarWars,1554239790,Aercyon,6,0,True,2019-04-02

1653,How the kind of humor might have a negative view on the ST,"There has been many threads on this subreddit regarding how bad the ST was, specially TLJ. Maybe I am wrong but I think there is a topic that was barerly dicussed here, and it's the humor present in the recent SW movie.
You people can not disagree that the type of humor seen on the OT/PT is very different compared with the one on the ST. It is a humor that is similar to the one we've seen on Marvel. It works there, but here it doesn't. It is forcefull, excessive and comes from nowhere, particularly on TLJ, movie which tries to show us that it is a ""serious and dark"" film where this kind of humor makes us believe just the contrary, making it confusing.
Some examples are: 
- The comical talk between Poe and Hux just before the fight
- Finn's comical wake up
- The destruction the hangar where a lot of people died, where Poe and BB8 survive showing it in a comical way
- Leia our of the blue told C3PO not to look her with such a face
- Leia slapping Poe
- Luke throwing his lightsaber in a comical way
- Luke drinking milk from a Siren in a comical way
- Finn being electrocuted in a comical way
- Most of the scenes of Canto Bight
- Luke taking advantage of Rey in order to bother her
- Rey seeing half nude Kylo
- At the moment which is supposed to be the climax, we see what it is supposed to be a ship landing but it really is a laundry droid
- At the moment which is supposed to be the climax, Rey fails in recovering her lightsaber, and she gets hit by it in a comical way because of Snoke
- On the final battle, the ressitance ships are dissasembled in a comical way right after Finn says something like  ""I hope they resist""

When I was on the theatre I remember that the audience did not laught at many of these situations, not because they were not funny, but because they were confusing. We are at a very serious moment of the movie, where a lot of tragedy happen, and our the blue there is comical situation. That is why, this humor is not consistent with the scenes, and very out of place. Again, this kind of humor did not happen on the OT/PT, and I seriously do not belive it belongs to an SW movie, even if it would be supposed to be a ""kids movie"". 
From my point of view, I am almost sure that if all this kind of humor wouldn't have existed on TLJ, it would not have received most of the hate that it has now, and surely it would have been a much better movie.

1654,The Fundamental Misunderstanding of Rey: A Defense,"Since TFA came out, arguments about Rey have raged within the fandom. This is to be expected. The SW fandom is one of the largest fandoms in the world and it has no shortage of people with insanely passionate and idiosyncratic opinions. Unfortunately, as we all know, many of these opinions can be hostile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's ignore the politically based backlash against Rey and just focus on the main criticisms you often hear about her from fans: She's a Mary Sue and she's too powerful without proper reasoning or justification. This is essentially what all of the issues with Rey boil down to among the fandom. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, I feel that many fans have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Rey is portrayed and what her character is. I feel many fans want and expect her to just be Luke 2.0 instead of her own person, and it shows with 99% of the criticism. People are so hung up on comparing Rey to the OT and the PT they completely skip over the fact they are supposed to be seeing Rey on her terms in the context of her own story. 

&amp;#x200B;

So much of the criticism of Rey begins with ""In the OT, Luke did \*fill in the blank\* thing."" 

&amp;#x200B;

No no no. This is not how you're supposed to see Rey. 

&amp;#x200B;

The story or Rey isn't supposed to follow the same Hero's Journey beats as Luke's. It's not a story of a young person slowly gaining power through training and mentoring. It's the story of a person with innate power already present with no direction on how to process it and how to find their place in the world. 

Rey's strength in the Force without ""proper training"" is exactly the point. The Force isn't something you need a decade of training from a Jedi to tap into and harness. It never has been. It's something you feel, something you allow inside of you.  So all this talk of ""no training!"" just seems to totally miss the point. 

Rey's intro in TFA is a clear, obvious example of ""show not tell"" in filmmaking. Y'know, the writing tool film buffs everywhere say they appreciate in storytelling but always seem to miss when discussing Star Wars? 

We first meet Rey when she's in the middle of scavenging. She's in the guts of a downed Star Destroyer, picking parts. We see she's tethered high up on rope, possibly hundreds of feet in the air. Right from the beginning we are shown Rey knows what she's doing. We're shown she's good with her hands, knows machinery, and is resourceful. She is resourceful because she NEEDS to be to survive. Jakku is an every man for themselves situation, and for Rey to have survived since being a little girl, she had to adapt. 

Right off the bat, her skills in areas of fighting and mechanics are clearly established with no more or less detail than Luke before her. Her ability to fight decently with a lightsaber is often brought up as being inexplicable due to the, you guess it, ""no training"" mantra. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but there is nothing IN THE FILM canon (or EU/Legends canon - that I've read) that states one MUST be formally trained to wield a lightsaber. It's not some totemic, mystical weapon only special people can use. It's simply the preferred weapon of the Jedi and Sith - just as the katana is the preferred weapon of the Samurai. You aren't going to magically explode or cut off your head with a lightsaber just because you aren't a Jedi or Sith. It's utterly reasonable to assume Rey's skills with her staff can translate to being able to sufficiently wield a lightsaber. 

You COULD argue that fighting with a staff and a sword is totally different. But this is Star Wars - a space fantasy about wizards and aliens and an invisible lifeforce that surrounds all living things. This is hardly some one to one analogy to real life. So either you buy that Rey with her staff skills can wield a lightsaber in defense, or you don't buy it. I think the film does more than enough to justify this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rey's introduction is a wonderful clinic in distilling the essence of a character with little to no dialogue. I hate to compare her to Luke when I just got done chastising haters for the same thing, but I think it helps support my argument. We know that Luke is a farmer with dreams of becoming a pilot. We know he's good with mechanics, and a good pilot...because we're told and shown this. Same with Rey and her array of skills and traits. I find it funny people lambast TFA for Rey being able to pilot the Falcon but totally ignore the fact Luke can fly a military vehicle (X-Wing) on the most important mission ever without any other explanation given from the film aside from the fact he's ""a good pilot"" and ""bullseyed womprats."" If anything, Luke becoming an X-Wing pilot for a military strike is MORE unbelievable than Rey being able to pilot the Falcon after finding out she can fly, but hasn't been off planet. 

And no, I'm not actually criticizing ANH with that last point - so don't misunderstand me. I have no problems at all with the storytelling in ANH. I'm merely using this an example to further highlight my points. 

 Star Wars (at least the OT) is praised for its world building and lack of extensive use of blatant exposition. This visual storytelling is present with TFA and TLJ, yet many detractors completely ignore this in favor of simply comparing Rey to Luke as if she's meant to be the same kind of character. 

Luke's arc is a more straightforward representation of the heroes journey. Rey's arc is more internal than that. Not to say that Luke's isn't internal, but the point of Rey isn't to become the archetypal hero ala Luke. It's not just about her finding her power and actualizing it. It's more about her finding HERSELF and and deciding once and for all what her purpose is. Her being so Force strong is just the method of delivering her arc. Her being so powerful without some in0depth explanation filled with lore and fanwank doesn't make her a Mary Sue and it isn't lazy. These films, so far, are saying that ""Hey, she's powerful in the Force. But that's not the point. That's not the journey. This isn't Luke. Look harder."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Rey is an orphan living in the quite literal bones of the past. She's on the outskirts of the galaxy, fighting to survive and dreaming of the age of heroes and villains where people fought for what was right. She's lonely, hoping beyond hope her family will return and take her away. She grew up with the false hope that one day, she'll learn she has a purpose, a path. That's why she's so naive and latches onto anybody who will give her a chance. Han became a defacto father figure. Luke was the mythic hero she heard about her whole life only to be let down by reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rey is a Mary Sue? Then why is she so gullible and naive? Every turn she takes, reality is thrown into her face. Her first promise of stability with Han is violently taken from her. Her chance to meet her hero and finally feel like she has a purpose, a direction, is dashed when she finds Luke a broken man who doesn't want to give her the time of day. Throughout her time with Luke, Rey is seduced by Kylo because he's able to get to the heart of what she feels inside, what she wants. If she can't change Luke, she can damn sure change Kylo. But as we all know, that hope is dashed as well when Kylo asks her to join him in conquest. 

&amp;#x200B;

For being a Mary Sue, Rey sure is an unfocused, easily manipulated and dangerously headstrong individual. What good does being so powerful in the Force do when you have no idea where you stand? What good does being so powerful in the Force do when you feel so lost even when you thought you may finally find a direction? 

&amp;#x200B;

So as I said: Rey is not Luke. She's not meant to be Luke. That is not her arc. I urge some of Rey's more fervent haters to reframe their mindset on who she is and how she is portrayed. Open your mind a little. If you still think she's a badly written character and will forever be a badly written character, so be it. I can't change your mind. You feel how you feel. But I still find it very restricted and narrow-minded that all I really ever see and hear about Rey from her haters is that ""she's too powerful"" and ""she's a Mary Sue."" 

Look at her motivations. Look at her background. Pay attention to how her powers are defined and used. It's far more nuanced than you think it is.

Ok people in the star wars universe have special organelles that let them tap into the force, so what? Why is that explanation such a bad thing?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I don't get is why do all the good guys use the light side and the villains use the dark side? As far as I can tell there's nothing inherently evil about the dark side, the people that use it are just jerks. It's been a while since I've seen the original trilogy, but according to my research the dark side is used by tapping into fear, anger, hatred, passion, and or aggression. There's nothing inherently evil about those emotions, in fact one of them doesn't even have any negative connotation. So why is it that only villains use the dark side in star wars? Also now that I think about it, why do force users even have to choose between the two sides? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to use both, that way they can have all the powers? I checked to see if there's anything inherently contradictory in the methods, and there isn't. As far as I can tell it's theoretically possible to use both sides of the force interchangeably in star wars, and there is absolutely no reason why anyone shouldn't.  


This next part may be slightly off topic, but aside from the fact that it's Disney, why didn't chewy run over there and rip Ben to shreds after he killed Han? Aren't Wookies suppose to be semi-ferocious creatures? I was kinda disappointed that chewy didn't rip him in half. Also that death scene made no sense, the light saber didn't appear to hit any major organs and it wasn't at a hot enough setting to kill him with heat alone (if it was he'd be burning).

1676,THE Star Wars Story,"Now I know The Old Republic isn't canon anymore, even though some might make it back eventually, but look at this. [Source; Old Republic Canon, Canon, and minor speculation] 

The Ancient Jedi Order was formed by people who discovered the force and wanted to use its power for good. To bring peace and serenity into the galaxy. Certain Jedi broke off from the Order, in order to test the dark side. Their curiosity led them out of the Jedi Orders limits. These Fallen Jedi went into exile, and on their travels found the planet of Korriban, the homeworld of the ""Sith Pureblood"".
The Sith Purebloods were naturally attuned to the dark side, and was formed from quite harsh conditions on Korriban. The Fallen Jedi, mostly (if not all) human, enslaved their species and mated with them, eventually forming the Sith Order and the Sith Empire. Making a code for themselves different than the Jedis. 
After a while the Sith Empire became a threat to the [mostly] peaceful Republic, and as war broke out, the keepers of the peace, the Jedi, who sought to destroy all evil in the galaxy, went to support the Republic. 
This is The Old Republic conflict, The Sith Empire vs The Jedi Protected Republic. The Sith Empire favored Humans,and looked down on any and all Alien Species, with maybe the kind exception of the Sith Pureblood Decedents. 
Now, war after war the Republic and The Jedi won, do to infighting amongst the Sith. They were all in it for themselves, and did not make trustworthy companions in war. So, in order to conquer this, Darth Bane, after the Sith were almost completely wiped out, enlisted ""The Rule of Two"". 

There should only be Two Sith at a time, a Master, and an Apprentice, as the Apprentice grows strong enough he will defeat his master or fail. Should the Apprentice fail he is killed by his master, and if he succeeds he will find his own apprentice to train in the dark side. 

Now afters several hundred if not thousands of years the Sith are believed extinct. That is until Darth Maul shows up, and clever Darth Sidious inflitrates the senate, making the Republic into its fomer enemy. The Sith Empire.

(Both the Jedi Code and the Sith code should be easy to google for any of your curiosities, as well as the gray one, which is a supposed mending of the two. The gray jedi are tired of the ideological fighting and seeks a middle ground. Balance, you may say. The rest of my sources is the Old Republic games as well as [History] &amp; Lore codexes found online, and/or read on youtube, enjoy!) ",StarWars,1554282982,martinbv95,6,0,True,2019-04-03

1684,How Kylo Ren's actions in the Sequel Trilogy could directly influence Episode X-XII,"Kylo Ren is the best thing to come out of this trilogy and it would be a shame for him to die in Episode IX. I've given it some thought and here is what I think would make the perfect story for the next trilogy, paying respect to the first nine episodes whilst bringing new things to the table So, without further ado...

Rey is revealed to have been suffering from amnesia given to her by her parents/master. Her involvement in TFA slowly started to ""awaken"" what she was already taught at a young age. She begins a new Force-using order. Grey Jedi maybe?

 The First Order are mad at Ben killing Snoke. It Is also revealed that the Remnants of the Empire post-ROTJ had a civil war of sorts to determine who the new leader should be before settling for the mysterious person of Snoke who appeared to them whilst on a planet. 

The First Order is defeated. Kylo Ren is faced with the epiphany that this was all for nothing and is filled with regret and guilt. His redemption begins. But wait! He doesn't die just yet, or return to the Jedi at all. Ben Solo survives IX and goes into hiding in the outer-rim. He meets a girl, gets married and has some children (Let's say... three?). He teaches them in the ways of force using Anakin's blue lightsabre... and maybe he has Luke's green one from ROTJ. 

In the meantime the Knights of Ren take it upon themselves to lead the FO. Keeping in tune with their name, the Knights decide upon a democracy (Remember the scene in ANH when the Imperials are all sitting around the table? Imagine that but they are all dark side users and rule it). This would be a background conflict (The Republic vs the Knight's Order) that could be expanded on. 

Ben is visited by the ghost of Anakin who asks why he manipulated Rey into thinking her parents were no-one. (I haven't quite decided on her yet.) Ben apologises for using him as an excuse to commit crimes and Anakin simply says ""I'm not in any position to judge, Ben."" 

At this point in the story Ben is the most wanted man in the galaxy. Why? Because he was still the man who committed all those crimes (In particular, the destruction of the Hosnian system) and the man who killed Snoke. The Republic hates him and any surviving First Order-remnant hates him. Then one day a republic probe droid (Similar to the droid used to find the Rebels in ESB) lands on his planet and captures video evidence of Ben. The republic sends a Venator to investigate and arrest him to make him stand trial on Coruscant. We see his children as now adults and each with lightsabres. (maybe Luke's green one, Anakin's blue one? Re-vamped Kylo one?) . This part is important because Ben doesn't put up a fight. He says goodbye to his wife and children and leaves. Two of his children take a ship and travel to watch the trial while the third stays behind with Ben's wife to manage the farm.

On Coruscant Ben is obviously found guilty and sentenced to capital punishment. Fuelled by fear, his two children try to reach him before he is returned to his cell but are knocked out. We now see Rey, a veteran of the new-Jedi and of the war of the KoR and Republic. Ben is executed and this sends his kids down a dark path of vengeance. They meet with the last of the Knights of Ren who tells them of a way to make the Republic pay. He tells them of people in Senate who wish away with the Republic - Separatists. This then sparks a second Galactic War. The main protagonists would be Ben's children. The audience would witness their mistakes. Things that make us think ""You shouldn't have done that."" and ""Did they just do something bad?"" and their continual morality issues, trying to be better than Kylo Ren, but desiring vengeance.

1687,Luke’s most important lesson for Rey: Your relationship with the Force is more important than your relationship with the Jedi Code.,"Hey /r/StarWars. One thing I’ve seen posted a lot about TLJ is how Luke didn’t *really* train Rey, he was just trying to discourage her from becoming a Jedi. I completely disagree with the sentiment. 

Even though all of his advice came from a cranky, cynical old man, there’s a lot of wisdom in what Luke teaches Rey. The closes real-world equivalent would be to tell someone “Your relationship with God is more important than your relationship with the church.” (Not that I believe in God, just a handy parallel.) He doesn’t want his lessons to be about the Jedi dogma, he wants her to connect to her spirituality.

In the OT and especially the PT, a lot of lessons are framed by the “Jedi Way.” That’s not a problem in itself, but it’s only part of the equation. Making all of your lessons about dogma causes you to run the risk of missing the forest for the trees so to speak. It’s like someone who can recite Bible verses endlessly but hasn’t done any charitable work. 

If Luke and Rey has spent more time with each other, I’m sure he would have taught her more about the things *he* learned as a Jedi, but given their limited time, he taught her the most important lesson he could: Connection to the Force is what you should seek above all else.

1688,"We Don't Get to Decide What ""Should"" happen.","So in a recent thread I wrote a post similar to this but I think a deeper conversation around this issue is worthwhile. 

Quite often I see my fellow fan's say things like ""that's not my Luke"" or ""this should have happened"" almost in such a way as to suggest that Disney should be writing their movies based on fans wishes rather than on what is the artistic intent of the creator. We are almost too possessive of our favourite characters to the point where we believe Han, Luke or Leia ""should"" be presented in a certain way and many of us when that doesn't happen act out as if its been a betrayal. It's almost as if there is this oddity in the Star Wars community whereby we believe that our collective voice should dictate the arc of our beloved characters. 

The truth however is that we don't have a say, nor should we really, it is at the discretion of the creative minds behind Star Wars what Luke ""should"" be like and what arc a character will take. As fan's we can influence this, we can even say if we hate or love what how that character ""should"" be portrayed but I do not believe that we have the right to demand what ""should"" happen. 

To me saying what ""should"" have happened to a given character is akin to telling an author how a book ""should"" end, its like telling an artist how the shadows in the painting ""should"" look or a restaurant what ingredients ""should"" be in the dish. We simply don't have the right to tell an artist how they ""should"" represent their art all we can do is say if we love it or hate. 

I do not say this to defend any creator or movie, I am not writing this to say that we cannot even express how we think a certain character should have been portrayed. All I am saying is that as fans, we do not have the right to tell the creators how they ""should"" be telling their story. We are really at the end of the day just consumers of their art, we speak with our wallets if you really don't like the direction that a character has taken then you don't need to consume their art anymore however that does not mean you have the right to tell them how they ""should"" be telling their story. 

TLDR: As Star Wars fans we do not have the right to tell Lucasfilm how they should be doing things, the only people who should be directing the story and the character arcs are the creators.

1692,"ST, world building and external sources","If this topic has being debated now, I first apologise since I havent seen it discussed this much.
Why the ST lacks so much in world building if you have seen just the movies? And why most of the plotholes and unanswered question in TFA and TLJ come from external sources, like novels, etc?
This did not happened as much on OT/PT. Before making the compares lets remmeber that OT is al old trilogy, so it kind of needed external sources to expand it. Also If I remember, most of this sources were side stories, more lore on the world, and knowledge on what happened between the movies,  they were never made with the instencion to solve  points that havent being answered on the movies and that could have.

Two examples would be:

-  Leia being banned from the sennate beacuse it was found out that she was the daughter of Dark Vader.
-  Rey ""downlading"" the jedi training from Kylo

This are just a few of a lot more. Just, why? Why we didnt have this on TFA and TLJ? It would have added so much more in the movie. If you are coming to tell me that this wasnt necesary or that we dont want politics, I can assure you this would have added a lot to the movies and would have made us understand what was going on. With the movies alone, we dont know why the New Republic is so absent and Leia making a resistance instead of being the republic army, we dont know that Rey downloaded traning.
Honestly, he ""dowloading"" traninng, not only they could have easely put it on the movie, but is also contradicts the SW lore. So now Jedis can download their knowledge to others, if thats the case whats the point of training on the first place?

I welcome everythone to discuss it, and to offer why this doesnt work or why you think it does. But please be civil and offer solid answers. I would prefer not to have a ""your wrong, im right and thats afact"" type of thing.

1702,"Regarding ST ships, and frustrations as a fleet junkie","First off, I'm not writing this to hate on ST ship designs; the MC85 is hands down my favorite SW capital ship. That being said... 

It bugs me that although the PT and OT each introduced the iconic ARC-170 and X-wing(among many others), the ST is yet to feature a single original starfighter design; we're still stuck with X-wings, A-wings and now Y-wings. As much as I like the T-85, it's still nothing more than a facelifted X-wing with canards. And no, FO TIEs aren't original ships, but rather endless variations of the classic Imperial design. 

The same applies for capital ships, although to a lesser extent. The Resurgent and MC85 are both very well-designed successors to the old ISD and MC80; unlike the near-identical X, A and Y-wings, both are markedly different from their predecessors. Yet these two are more of an evolution than a revolution, in that the former's a bigger, meaner Star Destroyer and the latter a bigger, meaner Mon Cal cruiser. Simply put, there's little to no deviation from the OT's stereotypical bad guy=Star Destroyer and good guy=Mon Cal cruiser dynamic, even when it could be so much more diverse. What's ironic is that although Disney has presented itself with just an opportunity with the Starhawk, they for some reason refuse to feature it in any media both in and out of the films. 

Now, I totally understand the need for uniformity in the FO ships as a nod to Imperial naval doctrine. My issue is with the Resistance/New Republic, whose fleets should theoretically be immensely diverse considering their reliance on local planetary defense forces. *Theoretically*. The question of whether JJ &amp; co. are willing to integrate these into IX to provide better context and some much-needed artistic creativity... will probably be answered late next week.

1707,*spoilers* galaxy’s edge and how it saves/explains disney’s star wars,"*warning: spoilers ahead*

so, for all who read the D23 article on galaxy’s edge, you know it’s canon and it’s focus on world building is astonishing. To me, the specific details help save and explain disney’s star wars, specifically last jedi.

ultimately, the major failing of the sequel trilogy and disney’s strategy for star wars was a lack of world building. George crammed his films, and authors crammed their books, to the brim with world expanding details. disney seems to fail with that in comparison. however, a lot of the buildings and merchandise in galaxy’s edge build a larger world on the galaxy. you got artifacts from both sides of the force, a detailed way of how to make lightsabers, droid making, clothing details, and recipes from another world. 

plus, if u think about it, nearly everything you buy and do connects to the last jedis theme of anyone can be a jedi. like rey, u r a nobody who r given the keys to study force artifacts, make your own lightsaber, get clothes on the side u r on, and even partake in missions from the resistance! you are literally the jedi/sith/soldier in training between episodes 8 and 9! 

how does this save the trilogy? well, the area was being negotiated and concepted during the filming of episode 7. this shows that disney had a plan all along but that they were doing a slow burn. 7 years leading to this, thats incredible!

1709,"What fictional character do you think could be described as ""Anakin Skywalker, but done right""?","I have a bit of a fascination for good characters turning evil. I think it was an interest I had since I was little, because it was intriguingly chilling to see a character who had previously had strong moral values to then truly believe in themselves when alter doing something deplorable.

Here and there I'd recently seen people talking about characters that satisfy this question, so if anyone can suggest a character who began as truly good and ended up indisputably evil (not misunderstood. Evil.) then I'd love to hear it.

Recently I came in late to start playing Warcraft 3 and one thing that interested me going in was that I heard people describe Arthas as ""Anakain Skywalker done right"", and during the Alliance Campagn it was looking good, with him becoming more and more cynical and desperate to achieve his ends in defending his people, taking darker methods. However, once he wields Frostmourne he sorta gets... possessed I guess?

1711,What if someone else had played Anakin in the prequels?,"I don't want to put down Hayden Christensen, he definitely improved in Revenge of the Sith, but he was just a little too creepy and whiny to really make his growth, and eventual fall to the Dark Side, believable, not to mention the romance with Padme. The biggest issue for himThese problems are, in my opinion, most prominent in Attack of the Clones.

I recently re-watched AotC, and it certainly wasn't as bad as I remember, except of course, the poor writing and delivery of Anakin's dialogue. But I think it could be salvaged with a bit of rewriting (""I am haunted by the kiss you should never have given me"" is stupid and should have been ""I should never have given you"" smh) and a very specific recast.

Ladies and gentlemen, Topher Grace.

Mr. Grace has always been a Star Wars fan, proven by his god-like edit of all 10 movies that was released mere days ago. His most iconic role as Eric Forman on That '70s Show even had him playing a devoted Star Wars fan. So that at least means he might have been up for the role (even though yes, he would have been very busy playing that character at the time).

In that sitcom, he portrayed a sarcastic, often deadpan but very awkward teenager with occasional narcissistic tendencies. He had his serious moments, times where he acted as a man in genuine personal crises, that I think are criminally overlooked when judging his acting ability.

The problem with my argument is that he didn't quite prove himself to be truly worthy of such a role as the cocky Anakin Skywalker until 5 years after AotC was released, in Spider-Man 3 (yes, THAT one). Grace played Eddie Brock, a news photographer and competitor to Peter Parker who eventually acquires the symbiote suit. His role as the villain Venom is not where he shines. Prior to gaining his powers, as Eddie Brock, he plays the perfectly arrogant, snarky guy who has earned his confidence and knows it well. He's not entirely a jackass - in my opinion he's one of the most likable characters in the film, who just got dealt a really crappy hand.

This Eddie Brock is exactly who I would have liked to see in prequel Anakin. He speaks very naturally and is brightly arrogant as opposed to creepily entitled. Now, maybe it's just me, but when I imagine Topher Grace reading Anakin's lines, flawed and uncomfortable as they are, he immediately makes them sound better.",StarWars,1551508129,Daxe16,13,0,True,2019-03-02
1712,Speculation about the upbringing of Finn in regards to his time as a Stormtrooper,"
I think with the end of the Star Wars Saga, we need more background on Finn’s story to have proper closure with his character. In TFA, we saw the upper layer of his character: a stormtrooper, runaway, traitor etc. In TLJ, Finn’s story became more of a side story. I don’t think that is something JJ intended for his character. I love TLJ and JJ said he loved Rian’s script but I also think each director has flexibility on how they want each character to reach the next stage of the story.  In EP IX a way to make the audience more emotionally involved with Finn’s story is to have a scene which gives us more of a background on what happened for him to run away from the First Order.
I think the steps he took to not just run away but to actually fight back indicates that he has intense hate for the First Order for some reason. Of course, we could argue that he runs away simply because it’s the First Order. I feel like this would give him less depth and make him less personal to the viewer. To have him stick out from the rest of the deserters in the First Order and give him his own personal arc I would love to see what the reason for his intense hate was. We know in TFA he was troubled by the death of the villagers on Jakku. This shows us that he has trouble with death and is not used to all these people dying also highlighting that he is probably new on the job. And he was a janitor before this. In TLJ we see he cares for animals and is particularly struck when the “horse” gets whipped. This indicates that he could possibly have a past with animal.
In the beginning of the movie I would love to see Finn with PTSD flashbacking to his childhood. We could see the death of his parents paralleling the death of the villagers. We can see Finn forcibly held onto by the Stormtroopers screaming for his parents. We then flashforward to him being given a pet by a Stormtrooper a few years later. He is a bit older and more robotic after spending years alone. He takes care of the pet for five years becoming close with it. Now we see a 15/16 year old Finn with his pet, who has grown much larger. We see the bond they have and how close there are. We then see Finn coming home one night after being sent to punishment for disobedience. He was given a light sentence of janitorial duties for a certain period of time. Giving more depth to the line in TFA. As he comes home a senior officer under Phasma who is a close acquaintance of Finn comes over. He tells Finn he got him off light this time but Phasma isn’t happy. Finn opens the door to his house but is grabbed and taken to a forest. Phasma stands in front of him with a couple guards holding his pet. Finn looks over at Phasma and says “No” in confusion and worry. Phasma tells the guards to let the animal go. Finn in relief thanks her. As the animal rushes over to Finn, Phasma says to her guards, “Kill it.” The animal falls in front of him. Finn looks down at his feet in dejection and sobs quietly having had so much loss in his life. 
Phasma then says “No more distractions.” 
This scene gives strength to Finn’s hatred for Phasma and love of animals in TLJ. While allowing us to connect with Finn’s character on a deeper level.

Act 1-

*Movie starts with Darth Ragmius having the upperhand.* Garse*'s lightsaber is a few feet to the right and a few feet behind Darth Ragmius.*

Darth Ragmius: Now I have you. After I destroy you, I will awaken the ancient one, and end the Jedi once and for all!

*Garse looks to his left and sees his hilt off to the left.*

**The hilt starts to vibrate, as it is being pulled**.

*Darth Ragmius raises his saber to finish Garse.*

**The hilt flies to Garse's hand, Garse activates the blade, and blocks the hit. He then Force pushes Darth Ragmius off the edge of a “cliff”**

**Camera pans over edge to see nothing but a large chasm. Darth Ragmius is nowhere to be seen.** 

*Garse turns off his Saber and turns towards a small starship. The camera moves down to against the cliff wall and fades to black.* 

*From inside the ship, Garse starts talking to his droid.*

Keppler: Did you get the piece of Kalmte?

Garse: Yeah I got the piece. Obviously, look who your talking to.

*Garse holds the piece near a blank panel to his left. Th. Panel opens and a claw takes the piece into it.*

*Garse lands at the Jedi homeworld.* 

*Garse walks into the library. The jedi database line the walls.* 

Librarian: Ah, Garse. What can I help you with today?

Garse: I'm just searching for the next piece. I'll be searching the database if someone calls for me.

*Librarian nods and makes “go on” gesture.*

**The scene shows Garse typing on a screen**

Librarian: Master Dorvek has called for you.

Garse: \*sighs\* of course he has. I just finished anyway. Tell him I'll be there shortly. 

*Garse gets up and walks off camera.*

**Camera moves to Jedi council room.**

Garse: Master Dorvek \*nods\* I was summoned?

Dorvek: Yes, Garse. We need to hear a full report of your mission.

Garse: I found the piece, Darth Ragmius was there as well, I pushed him off a cliff. I think he's dead, but he wanted the artifact to awaken a so called “ancient one”, and after a search in the republic's database, I have found the second piece. By my understanding there are three more. I'm going to go and retrieve the second piece. If we have them all, the sith cannot get them and awaken this ancient one. 

Dorvek: Your not going anywhere Garse. If the sith coordinate another attack, we need all of our Jedi here.

Garse: We have all the Jedi here except Grand Master Kelen.  We are defended well enough. Besides the piece is on Narctooine. I'll be back before the week is out.

*Gasps are heard from a few council members.*

Dorvek: \*laughs\* you think you're able to handle Narctooine? Its sun burned out 100,000 years ago, the only reason it is still habitable is because the core of the planet is vaporizing itself. The dark side of the force is very strong there. The planet that's eternally night has twisted the mind of countless Jedi. You are not going there. You are dismissed.

Garse: \*argumentatively\* the only reason those Jedi turned is because they were padawans whose masters were dumb enough-

Dorvek: \*angrily\* You are dismissed.

*Garse stares in contempt for a moment, then bows, and walks out of the room.*

*Garse turns toward the hangar.* 

**Camera moves to outside hall**

*He puts his hand on his earpiece.*

Garse: Keppler, meet me in the hangar, set the navigational systems to Narctooine. We're gonna get the second piece.

Keppler: Didn't Dorvek tell you to stay here to defend the temple?

Garse: Since when did I care what I was told?

Keppler: Since grand master kelen went missing.

Garse: He is much easier to deal with then Dorvek is.

Keppler: \*was

Garse: He isn't dead. I can sense it.

Keppler: Of course you can.

Garse: He was only my mentor. It's not like i would be attached to him or anything. What would you do if I disappeared? 

Keppler: Rejoice?

Garse: Ha Ha

Keppler: To Narctooine?

Garse: to Narctooine.

**Money falls into the gloved hand, seemingly coming from nowhere.**

**A orange jewel rolls out of the sleeve into the gloved hand**

1734,What makes the Millennium Falcon so fast? Do we have canon on this?,"My apologies if this is well-trod ground. My initial search of this site didn't turn up anything that seemed definitive. Here's what I'm curious about.  


Given the premise that ""The Millennium Falcon is the fastest \[starship\] in the galaxy"", then the obvious question is Why, and I can only think of a few explanations.   


1. The Falcon has cutting-edge technology no one else has.  

2. The Falcon is unusually well engineered, by someone who only did it once. (Instead of, say, making a zillion credits as a shipyard consultant)  

3. The Falcon uses conventional technology, but is lacking safeguards everyone else has, or dangerously/crazily defies design conventions for that technology.  

4. The Falcon just \*IS\* the fastest ship, because \[hand-wavy reasons\], and also it's cooler that way.  

5. The premise is wrong, and the Falcon, while a fast ship, is not the only such ship in the galaxy, but does have unparalleled hype around it (and a Kessel Run story to share), and a great pilot can make a fast ship do miracles.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've seen, I get the impression that 4. is closest to the justification in the films, but it wouldn't surprise me if fan communities or one or more novels might have decided that Han is a brilliant-but-crazy engineer whose breakthroughs are less about technology and more about taking risks with design. Or he knows someone else who is such an engineer, and got them to do genius work for a bargain price.    


Anyway, I was just curious if the fan community had landed anywhere on this, or if there were some officially licensed ruling on this question. Thanks!",StarWars,1551566106,wordboydave,20,3,True,2019-03-02
1735,How to legally see Episode IX while minimizing Disney's profits.,"So, lets get this out of the way. I am not advocating for Piracy, and I am not advocating for an outright cottboy. All clear? Cool! Here are some methods to legally support Episode IX while minimizing what Lucasfilm takes home.

1) I would recommend not seeing the movie in the first two weeks of release. If you see it in the first, it will add to the Opening Weekend success numbers. If you see it in the second, it will be viewed as ""positive word of mouth"" bringing audiences back. Avoid in these two weeks. This is also (typically) where movies make their most money, but Disney demanded an asinine 65-70% take home throughout the entire theatrical run. It is highly unlikely chains will bend to this after the disappointing numbers of TLJ, the flop of Solo and the abundance of genuine competition such as Jumanji.

2) Visit your local theater. They will have a harder time negotiating against these horseshit claims, and need all the help they can get.

3) Wait until home video, and rent. Do not buy! Get the family and friends together, the more the merrier, put in Episode IX and watch together. That's a good $35+ of revenue gone already from the Mouse's pockets.

4) Take the movie out from the library and do the same, or rent from a redbox, that will reduce their takehome amount even further.

5) Wait a couple months (or weeks at the rate things are going) and buy a used copy. All profits go to the store. 

6) Just don't see it. I'm not advocating for this (I am obligated to see it), but if you feel so upset that watching Episode IX will just make shit worse, don't bother.

So, these are 6, helpful, legal tips on how to watch Episode IX while reducing the Mouse's payday. If you have any others, feel free to add.",StarWars,1551566433,AryanWarrior420,24,0,True,2019-03-02

1747,"Dissatisfied with Thrawn's characterisation in new Canon [SPOILERS THRAWN TRILOGY, OUTBOUND FLIGHT, CANON THRAWN NOVELS]","SPOILERS THRAWN TRILOGY, NEW CANON THRAWN NOVELS

Am I the only one feeling dissatisfied with new Thrawn? Zahn says he considers the new canon novels to be congruent with the stuff that is now Legends, but I'm seeing him as anything but.

In the Thrawn trilogy, he was harsh and punishing, and very short with those he spoke to - mostly Pellaeon, few others were in on his plans and he certainly didn't seem to mingle with crew members. Specifically coming to mind are moments where he murders an offier who fails to capture Luke, and his overall complicity with C'Baoth, who wanted Leia's unborn children.

I realise that Thrawn's motivations were invented after the trilogy, around the time of Outbound Flight (which I haven't actually read yet), and have been carried over to new canon, and in Heir to the Empire he didn't need an overt motivation to play his role in that story, but in Thrawn and Alliances his constant respect for human life and prodding of his crew to understand his tactics is jarring. 

To be fair, I read the Thrawn trilogy first, then new canon, so maybe if I went back to Heir I would find this characterization is *technically* consistent and the conflict is is the way I imagined the character for myself, but surely other people have this issue?",StarWars,1551581533,Novacanoo,13,0,True,2019-03-02

1756,"Why Rey is a Maru Stu while Luke and Anakin isn't, Also why TLJ's story telling is worse than AOTC and ESB","1. Time between learning of the force and using it:
   1. Anakin gets a soft pass since he was literately made of the force. But he still doesn't actively use it until some undetermined time after joining the order. In this time he's likely to have been thought how to use it and first uses it to clump pebbles together. When tagging along with Obi-Wan on a mission he uses the force to throw a bunch of pebbles at him.
   2. Luke learned of the force and the Jedi. Spends a couple of days getting rudimentary padawan training of the usage of a lightsaber. Obi-Wans force ghost comes to him and tells him to rely on the force aka ""Passive"" usage instead of the guidance computer. Then he spends two years piecing together things on his own, learning to manipulate thigns with the force, letting him summon the light saber to himself on Hoth. Then a short time with Yoda where he learns some more.
   3. Rey learns of the force and the Jedi, but doesn't learn that she has that ability. Then she's caught. Mindprobed wherein she for some reason learns all that Kylo Ren knows of the force and lightsaber combat. As well as establishing a connection between the two of them.
2. Why one movie does the same thing worse than the others
   1. Attack of the Clones had 2 major story lines, Anakin &amp;Padme, and then Obi-Wan. You could argue that Dooku and Obi-Wan is part of the same one. But I view it as a ""convergence""/addition that adds his story line to Obi-Wan's.  Meanwhile we have the minor story line of the Jedi and Palpatine.
   2. Empire Strikes Back again has 2 major storylines, Luke, and Han &amp; Leia. With the minor story line of The Empire.
   3. The Last Jedi has Leia &amp; Poe aboard the Raddus. Then we have Luke and Rey on Ahch-To that for some reason has a major subplot to it. Then there's the Finn &amp; Rose adventure. And Of course the First Order  story line.  It doesn't have 2 major with 1 minor story lines. It has 4 major story lines, and 1 of them have a major subplot in it.

1764,My problem with the argument that the sequels suffer from contextual problems like 'fan nitpicking' and perfectionism,"I wanna start off by saying that the sequels, in some ways, have really compelled me. They are the most raw Star Wars movies since ESB, but to that end they also feel, at least to me, a little meaningless.

[https://twitter.com/jere7my/status/959639420109578240](https://twitter.com/jere7my/status/959639420109578240) \- Thread on the nature of the sequels and their perception by different generations that were affected by the EU and other SW material

The above thread is really insightful, and I agree with it to an extent, but I also thinks it takes away from people who like to react to Star Wars in whichever way they like, including negatively.  The thread is extremely insightful in understanding fan mindset and how the EU has affected years of Star Wars content (and the prequels enforcing that). Anyway, this post is specifically about his tweets regarding Rey and the nature of what it takes to be a Jedi vs the Mary Sue argument, as well as the need for Snoke to be at least given some form of attention.

Rey's problem doesn't lie in her lack of training, and I agree that some fans rely too much on the need for lightsaber training or specific force power training to be included due to the EU's/Prequels portrayal of the journey to become a Jedi. A lot of people have problems with Rey because of the fact her character, a Jedi or not, never really struggles. She is constantly rewarded for her hubris and naivety, and when not, such as in Last Jedi when she believes Ben can be saved, she escapes and is rewarded anyway, this time with new force abilities that rival Yoda's. She genuinely overcomes every obstacle she has with little effort or development for her character, and it vexes a-lot of fans. 

In regard to Snoke, I agree completely with Rian's choice to kill him, it was really great development for really the only compelling character in the sequels- Kylo Ren. I think a lot of fan disappointment with Snoke is not articulated properly, and I want to fix that. Snoke needs development or at least context not because of who he is in the story or how he impacts the current story, but because of what he has done himself to set up the sequels. Snoke demolished Luke, Leia and Han's livelihood, stole their future in Ben, all while being trusted in by Luke (see Last Jedi Novel). That means, by extension, he decimated their achievements that were visible in the OT, and the journey we went on with the characters together. Snoke single-handedly destroys it all (with a little help from Luke and Ben), and for that many people feel that that needs to be justified for the sequels to hold meaning and for the reset button to be pressed on the galaxy.

Basically there are two cliffhangers in ESB and one of them works for me while the other doesn’t.

The one that works for me is the relationship between Luke and Vader. The reveal that Vader is Luke’s father is a character-based hook that doesn’t dictate anything regarding the plot. You know that resolution is necessary, but you don’t know the direction the story will take. Everything is still on the table plot-wise. 

Conversely, I don’t think the cliffhanger with Han being stuck in carbonite works at all. It does do a good job of keeping the audience interested in what will happen next, but ultimately it hamstrings RotJ by forcing it to spend the first act of the story resolving that particular plot point. One of the reasons I like RotJ least of the OT is the way the plot basically starts from scratch after they leave Tatooine. It’s true that we get to see Luke as a true Jedi for the first time at Jabba’s Palace, but I can’t help but feel that you could have included that while also advancing a new plot.

1791,Thoughts on the Battlefront II campaign? (DICE),"I recently realized that the old Battlefront games were available to purchase on the Xbox Live Store. I've been playing them like crazy, Battlefront 2 is now one of my favorite games of all time, it's a blast. 

After beating everything the game has to offer, I decided to give the new Battlefront II a chance. I bought it for the multiplayer, but I started with the campaign. And wow, it was a slog... The story, in theory, is fine, but let me put it this way.. the story is ok but it has very poor story telling, if that makes sense. 

First of all, the dialogue. I found myself frequently cringing at it throughout the game. It's often cheesy (but not in a star warsy way) and the banter feels so artificial and hamfisted. the OT characters feel like caricatures of themselves, and the new characters are too boring to care about. I do like Shriv though.

The humor in this game is awful. Listening to Paldora, the guy Han has to contact on Takadona, was so painful. I was shocked that the writers thought this would pass as humor, especially in a SW game. 

The level design was very boring, and the gameplay was average. I think it's obvious that DICE does not know how to make a campaign. there were some really cool set pieces though. Crash landing ON a crashed star destroyer was probably my favorite part. 

But really I'm amazed at how a game like the Original Battlefront II has such a simple, straightforward, somewhat barebones campaign, yet it's leaps and bounds superior to the new one.

1798,Can I talk about how the last few episodes of Resistance have really been great for me?,"I don't know what the popular concensus on the series has become, or how many people may have dropped out, but the show has really come together for me in the second half since the First Order became a constant presence on the station.

&amp;#x200B;

The show no longer feels like the story of the *absolute worst spy* investigating something that for a long time didn't seem to be there (with some meh after-school special episodes thown in about being a good friend), and now its about ordinary people and how they react to the slowly growing threat of totalitarian opression and marshal law chipping away at their freedoms and way of life. I love that its not afraid to question a younger audience with a complicated question like ""How much freedom would you sacrifice for security?"", even if they're a little heavy-handed about bringing it up. (It feels like a wonderful throwback to Tron Uprising for me; still miss that show)

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot of sympathetic characters, with different points of view and its great that not everyone views the occupation as a bad thing. The techniques they show of the first order quietly silencing dissent and making people disappear. Of slowly insinuating themselves into every facet of life on the station, inch by inch. It's a great exploration of the sequel era and First Order/Empire ideology whereas before probably for most people (and most people still) it just seems like they were largely a death cult blindly following an evil space wizard.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of people were originally looking forward to seeing the aces, the Fireball and a greater focus on racing, and none of these things have had a big presence in the show so far.

1807,Why Vader's character is so fascinating to most people,"Disclaimer:sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. 

Why Vader is so attractive to us can be summed up in a single scene of the trilogies: when Luke cuts fake Vader's head off while training with Yoda on Dagobah and sees his own face behind the mask.


 Vader is presented as a pretty bidimensional character at first in the originals, a cold hearted brutal cyborg that kills whoever dares to put himself in his way, even in his first, and possibly most brutal, appearance in ""A new hope"" we know that he has something more than the ones around him, his black imponent cape wearing figure with mechanical yet elegant movements sticks out from the aseptic white of the stormtroopers and the pale colors of the rebels, even if he hasn't killed anyone yet we all know he is gonna do it, he is the sword of the Emperor, where the emperial war machine fails he succeeds, he is the highest and most terrifying expression of the Empire.

But as we later discover he is much more than that, he is aslo a broken man who ceded to the dark side after being presented with hopes of glory and power, he followed one of the most ancient feelings of the human race, egoism; let's be honest here, how many of us would have refused Palpatine's offer? Very few, egoism it's a brutal and primordial instinc that lies deep in everyone's heart, but, as we discover for Vader, in everyone's heart lies a more ""humam"" part where we feel like we have to achieve a good that goes beyond our personal interests. 

Vader rapresents the human side of the force not the light side rapresented by Yoda, Obi Wan and Luke, amblemished paladins of justice and order, and neither the dark side rapresented by Palpatine, vicious snake that hides in the dark and abuses other to reach his goals of greed and power, he is oscillating between these two extremes. 

That is why we connect so well to him:  his faceless, skull-looking mask and his armor could perfectly fit any one of us just like his egoist yet thoughtful personality, that scene on Dagobah was meant to tell us this. 

He is no one because he is everyone, neither completely good or bad, just imperfect, therefore, human. ",StarWars,1551659075,zeta7124,8,7,True,2019-03-03

1809,A Thought on Revenge of the Sith and Anakin's Fall (Tagged for spoilers just to be safe),"So, I just recently had this particular idea and thought it might make for some interesting discussion/feedback. If either Yoda or Obi-wan had still been on Coruscant when Anakin discovered &gt;!Palpatine's identity as Darth Sidious!&lt;, do you think Anakin would still have ended up falling to the dark side? Mace Windu, who not only had his own issue brushing with the dark side (which I think is still canon even disregarding any old legends material), but also had a personal dislike of Anakin, seemed like the worst possible choice to have in that situation, as he actively disregarded Anakin's emotions and thoughts on the issue. By putting Anakin in that situation, Mace forced his hand, leading to the point of no return and Anakin's consequent fall.

If Yoda, Obi-wan, or most likely any other Jedi without that kind of direct apathy/animosity towards Anakin had been around to lead the arrest team, it seems like they could reasoned with Anakin, or actually listened to his (understandable) request to capture &gt;!Palpatine/Sidious!&lt; alive instead of trying to execute him on the spot. At that point, even with the temptation of information from the Sith Lord and overwhelming drive to save Padme's life, Anakin still seemed opposed to the Sith and supportive of the Jedi; this only changed once he'd crossed that threshold and essentially caused &gt;!Mace Windu's!&lt; death. Obi-wan would have been particularly effective, since he pretty much already had an idea of Padme and Anakin's relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

1823,Why I think The Last Jedi (and the entire Sequel Trilogy) will stand the test of time as a great addition to the Star Wars Mythos," Firstly I will just say that I love both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens and that going to the cinema to see both films was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I never got the chance to see the Prequels in the cinemas so preparing for 5+ years of being able to watch a new Star Wars film every year was a very exciting prospect for me.

&amp;#x200B;

  

I will also say that I just really, really love Star Wars! I have enjoyed every piece of Star Wars media I have been exposed to: from the films to the TV series, the games and even a few of the books (though only 2 from the old EU). What I am setting out to do with this post is not just a defence of the new Disney films nor an attack on what came before them; all I want to do is express what I’ve really appreciated coming away from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi as instalments in the Sequel Trilogy.

&amp;#x200B;

 Let’s start with The Force Awakens. Honestly it was obviously going to be heavily-inspired by the Original Trilogy straight from the first trailer but I am a little bit fed up of people parroting the tired argument that somehow it following the basic setup and a few of the plot beats from A New Hope means that it is also a worthless film that does not add anything of value to the Skywalker Saga. That argument has become such an internet circlejerk it has become ridiculous to me. I will admit the film was not perfect. But I will only concede that point because a worldwide and objective acclaim for any film, especially one in a mainstream franchise, is frankly impossible. Everyone’s enjoyment of film is subjective to their own tastes. Yes, The Force Awakens had a few flaws but when I came out of the cinema after watching it after opening night I just had this amazing feeling of absolute euphoria. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 What I really appreciated, and what I think is the main driving force behind the entire Sequel Trilogy, is the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. What was honestly the biggest twist for me in the entire film was the moment when Kylo Ren takes off his helmet and there’s this hot guy with long hair underneath it. Him showing his face in the interrogation scene instantly humanises him to both Rey and us, the audience. I absolutely love the signs of him trying to hide his internal struggle with his mask, his black robes, even the burnt helmet of Darth frickin’ Vader! Kylo Ren has already become an iconic figure but he’s also so much more interesting because his gimmicks and costume do not define him as a fully-nuanced character. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Which brings me to Rey. Honestly the whole idea of anyone being able to be a powerful force-user is a much more positive one than the idea fans have from the Prequels and Originals that the Force could ONLY manifest itself in bloodlines for it to be most powerful. Anakin Skywallker was a kid when he first started to subconsciously used the Force. Plaguis and Sideous made him powerful by fucking accident! The Force being a higher power that manifested itself in Rey as a perfect foil to Kylo Ren, a new Skywalker child who is already being corrupted by Snoke and the Dark Side makes perfect sense to me. At the climax of The Force Awakens Rey is introduced to us as a nemesis to Kylo Ren, first challenging him for the Skywalker Sabre and then drawing on the Force to heighten her senses and defeat him. The film ends with Kylo Ren defeated and humiliated and Rey stronger than ever.  

&amp;#x200B;

  

A theme that is perfectly mirrored at the end of The Last Jedi! Kylo Ren has just killed another father figure in his life and in what should be a moment of triumph for the Dark Side he appears broken and lost as through his force connection with Rey he is spurred by her a second time after she previously rejected his arguments on Snoke’s ship. Kylo Ren’s main weakness is that he is always conflicted about who he should be, between embracing the Dark Side and reverting back to being Ben Solo. Rey is the nemesis of Kylo Ren but to Ben Solo she could be a catalyst for redemption.

&amp;#x200B;

   

The main problem with why it might not be really obvious that Ben Solo, the last surviving Skywalker, is going to be redeemed at the end of the Sequel Trilogy. This is because it has not been made explicit WHY he turned to the Dark Side in the films. I honestly believe that Luke’s attempted assassination of Ben Solo in the flashbacks in The Last Jedi was not the moment that Ben Solo became Kylo Ren but that we WILL see that turning point in flashbacks in Episode IX. That is the only capacity I want Snoke to show up in this final episode of the Skywalker Saga. 

&amp;#x200B;

  

Because at the end of the day Snoke is a character device, not an overarching villain. In killing and usurping Snoke Kylo Ren’s character arc has become really interesting because I really doubt he is going to be a good Supreme Leader of the First Order while he is divided between the Light and Dark. But Snoke was a large reason why Ben Solo turned to the Dark Side; its implied in a couple of the books that the twisted dark side fucker has been corrupting Ben since he was a child, practically grooming him to be used as a tool for the First Order. Snoke being dead makes it more likely Kylo will turn back to the Light, and as long as we see why Ben Solo turned to the darkness in the first place we can then see that process reversed by Rey and/or Leia.

&amp;#x200B;

  

Finally I would also like to say that although the overall plan for the Sequel Trilogy has changed I do not believe the overall character arcs or themes are different from the first pitch meetings in 2012. Both J. J. Abrams and Rian Johnson are genuinely competant film-makers who Lucasfilm has a good working relationship with. The Force Awakens had production problems with Harrison Ford injuring himself and many rewrites but Abrams did deliver a well-made and compelling film. I believe that is why he was offered the directing job for Episode IX after Lucasfilm realised Colin Trevorrow was a useless hack. Meanwhile Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi has been the only film without significant production issues and Lucasfilm have approved his pitch for an entire fucking trilogy for Christ’s sake!

&amp;#x200B;

   

Ultimately I am really looking forward to Episode IX, though I think the marketing is going to misdirect everyone in regards to the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey. Honestly I think every piece of Star Wars media has brought at least something worthwhile to the Saga and if the fandom kept an open mind about this final film we’d all be a lot happier!

&amp;#x200B;

   

TL/DR: Kylo Ren and Rey are the best parts of the Sequel Trilogy and I can’t wait to see how the Skywalker Saga concludes this December!

I want to talk about Xanatos, Qui-Gon Jinn's second padawan, who fell to the dark side and turned his saber against his master during  their last trial mission to Telos. Personally, I loved his characterization and his later appearances in the books, the way he played everybody like chess pieces.  He was a manipulative bastard, true, but he was one of those villains you couldn't help but love. A bit like Loki...

He was also impulsive, with lots of pride and anger since he was an initiate. Imagine that and a young Jinn who is blind to it all ( and a baby Kenobi o.o) I would have honesty loved to see an animated tv series or a movie spin off based on Jinn's padawans. Admittedly, Xanatos, and later, his son, Granta do make very intriguing characters in my personal opinion. They both had so much potential...but the force was not with them.

I have been thinking about it &amp; suddenly a prequel idea came to my mind. This new prequel trilogy will be based on the comics ""Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi” series.

""Dawn Of the Jedi"" series deals with the concepts of light and dark. How the Jedi started and it also delves deeper into the Force. It is such a wonderful series with Infinite Empire in focus. It deals with an era where the Jedi were just starting off and understanding the Force by reflecting upon two moons Ashla and Bogan.

Disney could make a trilogy based upon it and also tie in the story of ABELOTH and the THE ONES story with it. I think, if properly executed this Trilogy could do wonders fot the fandom.

1863,Redemption of Padme?,"One part of the Star Wars mythos that feels incredibly, almost devastatingly incomplete to me is Padme. It's criminal when you really think about it. She's Luke's *mother* and he never even asks about her till Return of the Jedi...that's nuts! Even more nuts, we can presume Obi-Wan and Yoda knew of her at the very least and even they never brought up a mother to Luke. **Crazy**. Only once, through Leia's vague recollections, do we get any insight into her and it's really not much of one at that. 

For whatever you might feel about the prequels, they're canon and Padme is actually like....the driving force for just about everything. Naboo versus the Trade Federation starts the momentum on Phantom Menace, being tasked to protect Padme gets the ball rolling in Attack of the Clones, and in Revenge of the Sith we learn Padme was Anakin's reason for living and dying- his actions are entirely motivated by her. It was a wobbly characterization but I do think she had flourishes of strength under-utilized, particularly her time in the senate.

Whereas Kenobi and Anakin both were retroactively redeemed by Guinness and James Earl Jones, Padme doesn't have that benefit and we're two movies in yet another triology and *nothing*. It kinda kills me. Natalie Portman is a lovely actress, we can cinematically de-age RDJr, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas, and like....y'know, she's Darth Vader's WIFE and Luke &amp; Leia's MOTHER. What gives? 

The Clone Wars do justice to Padme but I always longed for a flashback that has some kind of relevance to the present day involving Padme- some moving, earnest, heartbreaking monologue or speech from right before she died. I mean, what insane world are we living in that Darth Maul warrants a post-credits sequence and Padme doesn't get jack s--t?

I am listening to The Force Awakens audiobook as well as watched part of it last night. I am a huge fan of the movie itself (the scene with the Resistence flying in over the water gives me chills) but I have a couple of questions I was hoping to get answered.

1. The destroyed Star Destroyer on Jakku that Rey was salvaging (and I suppose the ATAT Walker she lived in) is it known what battle they came from? Was it a OT or PT-era battle?

2. Who was the man who gave Poe the missing map part to find Luke? What was his relationship and how did he get it/know Luke/Know Kylo?

3. I know Kylo killed the man above, but when the officer who gave him the news that the droid escapes Jakku, Kylo seemed to pause when igniting his sabre before destroying the console rather than killing the officer, whereas Vader would have killed the officer with no mind.

1871,DISCUSSION: The prequel era is the best era in the timeline,"As the title says. I think when George created this part of the star wars saga he invented the place where you could tell the widest and most interesting range of stories. You don't have to worry about the standard Rebels vs. Empire  which can feel very narrow . You can go to any planet and not have it tie in with any previous story i.e. you don't have to ask yourself before writing a story "" is this planet part of the galactic empire,"". Disney have really shown how dry that story template has run with them continuing that era into the sequels. It's dull and makes the previous stories from the originals feel pointless.

&amp;#x200B;

A good measure of what I am saying is Clone Wars vs Rebels. Both run by the same man, Dave Filoni, yet one is generally received better and I think it has to do with the fact that CW inherently has more interesting stories to tell because of the characters and time period. Further the prequels' political aspects strengthen the narrative overall and add quite abit of depth.

Do not get me wrong, I think the new ""concepts"" are great... but the execution is, from a storytelling viewpoint, terrible. Characters do not get development: we are ""told"" that they do, but it's never actually shown. Battle scenes are poorly choreographed. A lot of the plot twists are made mostly for shock value without any regard for the narrative, and I found a LOT of plot holes which are not explained at any point of the movies.

1878,Why I Love The Last Jedi,"I understand the Star Wars Fanbase has become a bit Toxic in recent years. The last Jedi is one of the most divisive movies of all time, even though it is a movie I adore, I don’t like discussing it with others because it is so controversial, so let me tell you why I love it.
1. (The Performances) in my opinion Mark Hamill gives the performance of his career. I also loved the performances from Daisy, Adam, Carrie, Andy Serkis, Oscar, Benedico, and Dohmnall.
2. (The balance of the drama and the comedy) This one is subjective but I thought the comedy worked pretty well, I thought that the pacing could have become dry without it, I love the porgs, but the dialogue is smart and unique, and the line delivery is just so good.
3. It takes risks(That Landed) Just because a movie takes risks does not make it brilliant, but if they pay of it def does. Killing Snoke makes Kylo a more interesting villain, also I feel if they waited till 9 to kill snoke it would have been predictable. So it was nice to see a surprise. Also I actually love that Rey is a nobody, I think it fleshes her out more.
4. (The action) I mean so much good stuff, that entire throne room scene, the battle on Craig, holdo maneuver, Finn vs Phasma, Luke going out like a boss. But also the fighting choreography is amazing, john willams score is incredible, breathtaking cinematography, visually it’s the most beautiful Star Wars movie.
5. (How it expands on the mythology of The Force) I just love what they did with Luke, I loved the scenes between Kylo and Rey, I just can’t wait to see what they do in episode 9

1879,Star Wars Resistance is growing on me,"When Star Wars Resistance first premiered last year, I didn't really think much of it. The pilot episode was good, and the other episodes weren't bad or anything, but the show kind of seemed like a step down from Star Wars Rebels. I stopped watching after about 5 episodes, and after that I couldn't really get back into it.

But recently I've heard people saying that it gets better as it goes, and a few issues of the Star Wars Adventures comic are based off the show, so I thought I'd try to get caught up. And I gotta say it's actually a lot better than I gave it credit for.

It still has problems, like the fact that it takes a while to really get to the First Order stuff, but the events of each episode do have some kind of pay off later. It's also clearly aimed at a younger demographic, which shows itself in the form of some humor that doesn't work for me, but for what it is the show is actually pretty entertaining. The animation is really on point, and I like all of the characters. I also like how it's balancing out individual episodes with slowly building up to the First Order.

I'm about 10 episodes in right now, and I'm actually interested in seeing what happens next.

1886,I can't wait to read about Rey starting her Jedi Academy,"One of the things I'm looking forward to the most after EP 9 (and during it if we are lucky) is seeing Rey start her new order. 

This is going to be a order that is totally detached from the corruption and blindness of the PT order and Luke's order. We can finally have a Jedi Order that follows the will of the force.

And of course she will do a lot better than Luke would have/could have. I mean she is going into it without the influence of any of the PT era masters and their teachings. She will probably find new ways of training that Luke wouldn't have like letting adults train or allowing emotions or relationships. I mean sure Luke tried but he was destined to fail from the start. It would have made no sense for him to succede. But they have set up Rey that she has more than everything she needs to succeed where  Luke failed.  And she has such a better grasp on the force and more training than Luke ever got from Yoda and Obi-wan which I'm sure will allow her to be a much better teacher than Luke was. 

Luke's failure and the PT's legacy of failure will be a great start for her to build off of. and we will get to see her make a Jedi order of her own that isn't connected to Luke or Yoda or that era of misguided jedi. Instead we can get some new knights who better represent the force and the galaxy.  I'm sure Luke and maybe even Yoda will be held up as mythic figures in the textbooks but seeing as they both failed as jedi and failed their students I hope she doesn't try and recreate any of their teachings. Luke had his shot and now its time for Rey to do it. 

Rey's Jedi will have no direct connection to Luke or the old order and that is a good thing. Rey's Jedi will be Jedi that are taught that belief is what is necessary instead of all the training and rules and oaths of the old order. The ancient texts (That luke didn't even try to read) will allow her to make up for all of Luke's mistakes. ",StarWars,1551754137,rememberthetantiveIV,9,0,True,2019-03-04

1888,It would be nice if we could get an official video game tie-in to Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron,"If there's one thing EA's Star Wars: Battlefront II did right, it's the starfighter combat. Of all the Star Wars flying games I've played- *Rogue Squadron, Jedi Starfighter,* and space battles in the original *Battlefront* games by Pandemic- BFII's Starfighter Assault mode feels the most authentic to the movies. Since first playing Starfighter Assault in the beta, I've said the Criterion Games (who created the mode) should be allowed to make their own standalone Star Wars flying game, like a Rogue Squadron reboot.

Now, with the announcement of the novel [Star Wars: Alphabet Squadron,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/ahe4km/alphabet_squadron_by_alexander_freed_official/) I feel it's the perfect time to release a new Star Wars flying game, based on Battlefront II's starfighter combat, featuring the characters from the new novel.

Playable starfighters would include all the iconic Star Wars ships you would be expect:

* T-65B X-Wing
* BTL-A4 Y-Wing
* RZ-1 A-Wing
* A/SF-01 B-Wing
* UT-60D U-Wing
* T-47 Airspeeder
* Han Solo's *Millennium Falcon*
* Hera Syndulla's *Ghost*

There would also be a panoply of Imperial ships to fly as well:

* TIE/LN Fighter
* TIE/IN Interceptor
* TIE/SA Bomber
* TIE/SK Striker
* TIE/D Defender
* TIE Advanced X1
* Boba Fett's *Slave I*
* Bossk's *Hound's Tooth*
* Dengar's *Punishing One*

Also a few Clone Wars era starfighters as unlockable bonus ships:

* ARC-170 Starfighter
* Alpha-3 *Nimbu*s-Class V-Wing
* N-1 Starfighter
* ETA-2 *Actis*\-Class Interceptor
* Darth Maul's *Scimitar*

With Starfighter Assault in Battlefront II receiving almost no post-launch content in the form of new maps or vehicles, and the announcement of the Alphabet Squadron novel, I think the time is ripe to allow Criterion Games to make their own standalone starfighter combat game.

1892,Age appropriate books for a 4 year old?,"So my 4 year old has really been getting into star wars lately. So far, I've found the little golden books, and the 5 minute star wars stories.


 I feel the little golden books are a good idea, but kinda missed the mark. When you try and cram 20 minutes of screenplay into every sentence to get the whole movie into a 12 page book, it's pretty hard to absorb it. 


The 5 minute books however, I've found to be amazing. Focusing on one particular small story 5 minutes at a time is a really great format. After getting through both books, you get a pretty good overall idea of episodes 1-8, but there are obviously a lot of gaps. The art is also really great and appealing to a 4 year old.

1897,A Brief history of The Dark Jedi (Fallen Jedi) and how it is relevant to Skywalker Story.,"Thousands of years before the Clone Wars,  there were many other wars that occurred between Jedi,  Sith,  and Force users alike.  One of the most famous of there wars was Hundred Years Darkness. This began after a rogue Jedi wanted to further explore uses of the force, therefore learning the ways of the Dark Side. He had a number of followers, and when this revelation was found out by the Jedi Order,  The Hundred Years Darkness began.  The Jedi Order prevailed after the Battle of Corbos,  and the Jedi who turned were sent into exile, aboard unarmed transport ships.  

Eventually,  the exiled Jedi,  otherwise known as ""Fallen Jedi"" or the ""Dark Jedi"", stumbled on a desolate planet of Korriban, (also known as Moraband from TCW) the ancient homework's of the Sith Species. When the Dark Jedi came to the planet, the Sith were so amazed by the powers wielded by them, that they worshipped the Dark Jedi as gods. This also led to interbreeding between the two,  which in turn created the Sith Cult.  It was on Korriban that the Sith would erect the temples seen on the planet, as well as the Sith Academy.

(Keep in mind that the Dark Jedi are NOT the same as the Sith, for the Sith are similar to Jedi Order in the way that they belong to an organization and follow a code whereas the Dark Jedi do not. )

There were many Sith who led wars against the Order and the Old Republic, such as Darth Nihilus, Darth Malak,  and Darth Bane, as well as Revan (although Revan was more considered a Dark Jedi than a Sith).  It would be Bane who would establish the Rule of Two,  which allowed only a Master and Apprentice as the only two Sith Lords. This was established after Bane foresaw the inevitable fighting between the Sith among themselves--therefore created the Rule of Two to preserve the Sith Teachings.  Once an apprentice had learned the ways of the Dark side completely,  they would kill their Master and adopt a new apprentice. 

--How this all relates to Canon--

Darth Plagueis would continue to adopt this tradition, and tought Sheev Palpatine the ways of the Dark Side. So in a way,  Plagueis already knew that Palpatine would betray him at some point, so his death wasn't at all surprising. Since Palpatine was first trained in the ways of the Dark Side though, he would be considered a Sith. The one thing that was unorthodox with Sidious though, was that he never wanted to give up his reign as a Sith Lord. (having an apprentice overthrow him), that is, until he met Anakin who was extremely strong in the Force. When Sidious found out the power behind the Skywalkers, he saw on opportunity for a suitable heir.  This is why Sidious constantly wants a Skywalker to give in and kill him in the name of the Dark Side,  so that the Sith could be more powerful than ever. 

Asajj Ventress would be considered as a Dark Acolyte, as she was born from the Witches of Dathomir,  a cult established by a different group of Dark Jedi who did not follow the ways of the Sith. When Sidious saw that Dooku was training Ventress in the ways of the Dark side, Sidious saw a flaw, and demanded that Ventress was to be killed. He also did this in the same way when he found Darth Maul taking Savage Oppress as his apprentice, killing him as well.  

When Sidious met Anakin Skywalker,  he saw the fear and anger that Anakin always had since the death of his mother. Taking advantage of that, Sidious had convinced Anakin that learning the ways of the Dark Side could lead to even greater possibilities. So when Anakin turned his back on the order in ROTS,  Anakin at the time would be considered a Dark Jedi (because he abandoned the Jedi to learn the ways of the Dark side). It COULD be argued that throughout the Galactic Civil War,  that even though Vader was portrayed as a Sith,  deep down he still had the Jedi in him [but moreso a Dark Jedi than just a Jedi. The reason for that goes back to his previous emotions.. Such as Fear. Where the Sith are supposed to fear nothing, similar to the Jedi] It's how Padme knew that there was still good in him,  just as Luke said there was still good in him.  Even though Vader had overthrown Sidious,  with him dying at the same time he had essentially destroyed the line of Sith, but after facing his greatest fear (Sidious, after seeing the torture of Luke), Vader had restored balance to the force and could continue to live on as his consciousness in the Living force with Yoda and Obi-wan.

1905,Why Odysseus/Ulysses will appear in Episode IX.,"&gt; I believe that the legendary Greek hero Odysseus (known to the Romans as Ulysses) was in fact force sensitive and that the Greek gods were in fact powerful force users who had successfully achieved practical immortality just as Darth Plagueis and Sidious hoped to. There is phenomena in Ancient Greek mythology attributed to “magic”, but I believe this was likely just the Force. In the Odyssey, Odysseus famously claims to be “nobody” when introducing himself to a Cyclops so that no one will come to his aid when he calls for help, hence Rey stating that her parents were “nobody” after misinterpreting a force vision of this.

&gt; Some time after the events of the Odyssey, Odysseus made contact with denizens of the Star Wars galaxy, which I believe to be the Andromeda Galaxy, during the original trilogy. In the old pre-Disney canon, there was a single point near the edge of the galaxy where hyperspace travel outside of the galaxy was possible, which I believe was secretly discovered by Palpatine during the original trilogy as part of his exploration of the unknown regions to find a powerful dark side disturbance, which is often interpreted to have been Snoke, but which I believe was a Greek god, possibly Hades, who was farther out than Palpatine predicted. Palpatine probably then secretly sent an expedition to Earth where he kidnapped Odysseus and possibly various Greek gods, explaining their disappearance from the historical record.

&gt; Odysseus, and possibly others, were taken to the secret imperial outpost on Jakku where we know Palpatine was studying the unknown regions and, I believe, was also testing cloning. Just as Vader tested carbon freezing on Han before attempting to use it on Luke, Palpatine tested cloning on Odysseus before attempting to use it on himself, and he modified the clone’s gender to test the limits of genetic engineering. Once the clone was a few years old, Odysseus and/or the Greek gods stole a ship that they attempted to use to return to the Milky Way Galaxy, creating her memory of a ship flying away without her when she was a young child. Shortly after this, or at the same time, the clone escaped into the desert and became a scavenger, creating Rey. However, the Greeks failed to return due to the hyperspace disturbance at the edge of the galaxy, and so were left stranded in the unknown regions, setting them up for Episode IX.

With that out of the way, I had a question about Force power sustainability. When watching episodes 7 &amp; 8, I noticed that characters like Kylo Ren and Snoke had the ability to ""freeze"" subjects in place while continuing to do other tasks like interrogate.

It seems like every other Force user has to do some kind of thing with their hand, like wave it, make a grappling shape (i.e. force choke), or sit and focus on it until they continue on with whatever they're doing and the manipulation stops.

Could powerful force users like Snoke and Kylo theoretically place people in a freezing state indefinitely? Or do they just have the ability to focus it while multitasking on other things?

1907,Josh Trank Boba Fett Movie Details,"*Below is a summary of some of the main events that were anchor points in Josh Trank's Boba Fett movie based on the notes provided to us by Lucasfilm. I'm releasing this in hopes that some of the incredible art we developed for months will leak because I really believe the fans missed out on something special.*

\-The first sequence featured a squadron of mandalorian armored mercenaries storming an Imperial garrison looking to assassinate a yet unidentified imperial commander (likely to be someone for the canon fans, in concept art it was Thrawn). The mercenaries quite easily mow through the stormtroopers until they enter a command station that has Darth Vader flanked by death troopers. Vader mows them all down and force chokes Boba, the last man standing, in the air trying to interrogate him. Boba reveals he was hired by a third party. Vader puts the pressure on and Boba's masks breaks and Vader recognizes the face of a clone trooper right away. He spares him and has the troopers entering the room put him in a detention cell.

\-Vader confronts Boba in the cell interrogating him about his past. Vader originally thought he might be a clone from the clone wars but reveals that any surviving clones would be much older than Boba appears to be now. Boba establishes that he is just a simple man trying to make his way in the universe and Vader senses that Boba will do anything for the right price. He offers Boba to hunt down and bring in whomever put out the hit on the imperial commander in exchange for the location and name of the Jedi that struck down his father.

\-The seconds act was Boba hunting down the third-party alien that originally hired him. Once Boba finally finds him/her, the alien gets tipped off when Boba starts asking who called in the hit. The alien flees which leads to a speeder bike chase through the streets of malastare. One of the main features of the chase were it finding itself in the middle of a pod race. One of the ideas was to showcase a pod race on a different planet and how this race would suggest that pod racing would vary from planet to planet based on that planet's features. Malastare would feature much more narrow canyons and uneven terrain than the Tatooine race featured causing more issues for Boba to navigate during the chase sequence along with avoiding being killed by the pod racers.

\-Boba manages to get a location out of the alien and travels to a tbd rainy jungle planet. He lands far away from where Slave I detects life forms and tries to sneak into their camp. He avoids a series of traps until he is eventually caught in one of them. 

\-When he comes to he is confronted by a man that looks just like his father, and then several more come to him looking for answers. Boba has come across a large camp of who is left of the surviving clone troopers from the clone wars. The empire is hunting them down as they were able to override their programming and disobey order 66. They now plot and try to find ways to strategically disrupt the power of the empire. They are joined by their ranking general, the jedi master Mace Windu who is scarred and has a metallic arm (concept art which sneakily was put in the Force Awakens concept art book without context). Boba does not recognize him, but Windu is particularly stern to Boba and all the clones in general, so Boba develops a distaste for him. Boba finds out the remaining clone troopers that didn't desert and were accounted for were destroyed when the empire decided to start recruiting civilians.

\-Boba assimilates into the group of clone troopers and starts to become one of them. A long time passes and Windu and Boba are sitting around a tented fire, the battle hardened Windu finally opening up to Boba. Windu is about to tell Boba that he killed his father when a sonic boom erupts in the sky. A lone star destroyer peaks out of the clouds of the rainy atmosphere while troop transports come out of the sides. It's later revealed Vader had a placer tracked on Slave I assuming Boba would be killed while looking to collect his bounty.

\-It's jungle warfare as the clone troopers fight the stormtroopers for their survival. Midpoint through the battle Windu looks up at the star destroyer and senses ""Skywalker."" Windu tells Boba he needs his ship to get to Vader and Boba says no one pilots that ship but him. They fly up to the ship together and and Boba supports Windu as he cut his way to the bridge of the ship.

\-Windu and Vader face off. Windu defeats Vader. He is going to give the final strike when Vader reveals to Boba that it was Windu who killed Boba's father. Boba has a flashback in which he sees the moment replay of his father being slain. He is taken over by rage and lifts his blaster to shoot Windu. Windu has been in a similar position before and lifts his hand and uses the force to crush Boba's blaster which explodes and knocks Boba back several feet. Boba in a great deal of pain raises his wrist rocket and presses a button on it that is suggested in the first act of the script in a throw away line could be fatal if used as he's not exactly sure what it does. Boba presses it and it discharges a very bright beam that completely disintegrates Windu and several feet of the interior of the star destroyer. The few remaining clone troopers win their land battle, and are spared orbital bombardment at Boba's request.

&amp;#x200B;

The media said the reason why the Boba Fett movie got the boot was due to Fantastic 4 tanking and the alleged on set behavior of Trank. This is partially true, but there were so many more issues that factored into this getting canned.

\-Disney wanted a strong female protagonist/love interest for Boba which did not come to fruition

\-The movie would have featured Samuel L Jackson and Temuera Morrison but there was a large debate about what to do with Boba. Having Morrison in the movie made sense but it would make less sense to have a different young actor to play Boba since we already knew what the young version of the clone looked like.

\-The ending was deemed ""a major bummer"" by Lucasfilm higher-ups

\-There was worry about featuring Vader too soon since a common complaint being bandied about online was people being sick of the Skywalker story

\-lots of other internal politics that make little sense to even people who work here

\-Ultimately Disney could not determine if they wanted to lean into the prequel trilogy in such a prominent way. Very briefly the art team was creating concept art for a potential remake of the prequel trilogy that would happen a few years after episode 9 was completed as an exploratory option just to see what something like that might look like. It would also be a way to continue the big money episodic events and help blow open the almost non-existent Chinese market by ""starting over"" at the first episode. It was never seriously discussed but it was something that was at least being talked about as a remake of the OT was completely off the table. This movie would have completely pushed out any possibility of that and the success of later movies would determine if they actually needed to consider this a viable direction of the property.

\-Many of the ideas being developed for this film got snatched up for use in some upcoming projects, so if a version of this movie ever goes back in production, expect some pretty big changes.

1910,WebComic - FanFiction,"Hi all,

Obligatory “long time lurker” :) 

So I’ve been working on these episodic scripts for a web-comic idea I had surrounding Star Wars and it’s EU lore. Basically, a very liberal universe using Star Wars knowledge. So far I’ve gotten some pretty good feedback and I was wondering if anyone knew where I could perhaps find an artist who loves Star Wars as much as I do and draw/color my web-comic for me. 

Synopsis:
A long time ago in galaxy far, far away…
Episode I: A New Beginning
It is a period of peace in the galaxy. As the Varik family relocates from the Twin World of Talus to Naboo, we find the eldest child of the Varik family, Advent, reeling in from having to start fresh in a new system. What new challenges will he face in Naboo? Will he join Rebel Alliance High School or the Galactic Empire Academy? Which cliques will he be a part of? Or will he be just another scruffy-lookin’ nerf-herder? Let’s see how Advent wrangles life as a teenager and which friends he’ll make along the way… in a Galaxy Far, Far Away…

^every strip will be a numbered episode =P

Of course, I’ve tried to make it as funny as possible, but at the same time do a lot of fan service. So it definitely includes a lot of former canon material. 

I wanted to also ask you folks if there’s any interest in something like this? I was working with someone and have some of his art, but we lost contact. As soon as I get my Imgur unbanned (someone hacked, because why not?) I’ll upload some of the early drafts of his work. 

Lastly, if I’m in the wrong place to asking this, please do let me know. I’m really enjoying writing this stuff and would like to share it on the interwebz with good artwork to go with it!

1917,Let's talk and speculate about the death of Padme!,"Padme's death is the subject of a lot of hate and a lot of funny memes about dying of sadness and stuff. I want to have a discussion about the nature of her death and speculate on why it happened without the usual ""Lucas is a bad writer"" stuff because that is boring and in universe speculation is fun and we could use some fun around here! This thread is for those who enjoy fan theories and making headcanon around plot holes and stuff. 

I personally do not believe Padme died of a broken heart. I think it's just a meme and there is no dialogue in the film that points to it. Padme does say ""Anakin you're breaking my heart!"" but she says this in an unrelated scene 20-30ish minutes before she dies. At this point Anakin hadn't even choked her with the force. She was alive. a bit disturbed by Anakin's choices but alive. 

 The other instance in the film where people might assume she just died of a broken heart is the fact that the medical droids say ""She's lost the will to live."" But if you think about it. Does that necessarily mean that  is her cause of death? If I was fighting a particularly aggressive disease and lost the will to live and passed away, Would ""Broken Heart"" be my cause of death? No! of course not! (I also personally don't believe George Lucas had the real life ""Broken Heart Syndrome"" in mind when writing that scene) The medical droids also clearly state ""For reasons we cant explain. we are losing her"". Why would they say they don't know what's killing her and then immediately say ""She's dying from losing the will to live?"" There is clearly something else killing her and I highly doubt it's from the metaphor Padme says in a line from 30 minutes earlier in the film (Broken Heart) 

So if she didn't die from sadness. What did she die of? That's a great question! Vader's force choke? I doubt it. Obi Wan checked on padme and she was still breathing (and able to talk and name her babies) Vader also felt she was alive 
&gt;""She was alive. I felt it""

I also doubt it was that or any other medical emergency because those advanced medical droids would detect something as simple as space aids, pregnancy complications, cancer or crushed throats. You could maybe say that Polis Massa medical droids were just not that advanced compared to the medical droids in fancier areas but I feel like Star Wars has never really had any examples of that sort of thing.

Now there is a very popular theory that Sidious killed her. I mostly like this theory and it does somewhat line up with everything but I feel like it's been discussed to death and unfortunately, I vaguely remember years ago possibly in an IGN interview related to The Clone Wars with someone at Lucasfilm that the theory was straight up denied. (Take that with a crait sized grain of salt as i've been looking and failed to find a link to the interview so it's possible i'm misremembering) 

So if it's not Sidious. Who killed her?  I'm afraid the answer is not quite as exciting as the above fan theory (But better than ""dying of sadness"") The only explanation I can think of is ""The Cosmic Force"" Her death is simply tied into the prophecy of the force. It's pretty obvious if you think about it. Anakin, the chosen one, a  powerful being birthed by a magical cosmic force. Basically space Jesus was born to fulfill this cosmic prophecy and part of that prophecy was that his lover was destined to die. He was haunted by visions of it all throughout Revenge of the Sith. It's the Star Wars version of ""Everything god does is for a reason"" (And Lucas loved using religious metaphors in the prequels) So the force basically did what it did (Maybe altered her midichlorians?) to cause her to die. That sounds like a pretty cruel thing for the force to do right? Well think of this. If Padme lived. There was no way those kids would have been safe. By dying. She inadvertently saved Luke and Leia's life. 

What do you guys think? Am I crazy? Is this the ramblings of a crazy fanboy? It probably is. But it's fun to speculate. I hope one day we get a canon take on these events.

I obviously don't believe that he did a great job with the Revan novel. Drew Karpyshyn thinks he's above everyone else and thinks he's on George Lucas level in terms of Star Wars writing.

1924,What is the Force?,"I mean what is it specifically? We hear it described as an ""energy"" that exists in all living things, and the extent to which it exists in a being is measured by midichlorians. But it's also a tremendous source of power that can be drawn on by skilled practitioners, presumably through mental mechanisms that are never explained in detail. It allows one to move inanimate objects, alter the perception of others, create a sort of lightning, move at great speed and leap fantastic distances, and even survive what would usually be fatal.

At the same time, it appears to have a will of its own. It is credited with the ability to guide beings on particular courses (often leading to serendipitous reunions), though to what degree it can control/influence being's actions is also unknown. It can be corrupted, or at least its power can, though some who use the ""dark side"" believe it to be a seperate entity with a disparite will (see Momin).

Is the force an entity in some respects? Perhaps non corporeal, or maybe living on such a massive scale that we can't see it? Has it always existed? Why are some species resitant to it? Does it have a goal? Can it be considered a character? Will Lucasfilm/Disney ever really answer these questions, or would that destroy the integral mystery that helps define and mystify the Force?

1954,Why Kylo Ren is much more powerful than people think.,"I believe that Kylo may be one if the most powerful SW characters in all of the movies, firstly he part of the Skywalker lineage, a family notorious for the power in the force. 

Secondly, his father was Han Solo, who was renowned as one of the best pilots of his time, so surely because of this, Kylo Ren would be extremely (or at least quite) skilled at flying. Especially that Anakin Skywalker was his grandfather (again someone who was known as one of the best pilots ever).

Now in TFA, we all know he technically lost to Rey, however there are many reasons why this happened: He was previously shot in the gut by Chewie’s bowcaster (a weapon that sent stormtroopers flying), he had just murdered his own father (which as Snoke said: split his spirit to the bone). He also managed to outrun Rey and Finn in the forest after starting to chase them from the inside of starkiller base. He easily disarmed Finn (who had been trained in melee combat and beat phasma in a duel). He easily force pushed Rey (a very strong force user) very high up in the air onto a tree (this is comparable to Obi-Wan force pushing Grievous in RotS. And finally, he didn’t want to kill Rey, he just wanted to capture her, but she was intending to kill him and Rey was already trained in melee combat with her staff.

Now even after all that he still put up a good fight and was on the offensive with Rey the whole time and most likely would have killed her if he intended to, it was only at the very end of the fight that she got the upper edge.

Also in TFA, he was shown to easily be able to freeze blaster bolts and people, read their minds and knock them out with the force.

In TLJ, he showed his piloting skills in destroying the resistances main hanger and having the opportunity to destroy their bridge (although he didn’t because of Leia). 

He was able to trick Snoke and kill him with Anakin’s/Luke’s/Rey’s lightsaber. After which he fought the praetorian guards seemingly with ease (however at the end when he lost his lightsaber he did need assistance from the Rey to kill the guard). He then split the lightsaber in half along with Rey using the force. 

Finally, in TLJ, when he is on Crait and he sees Luke, he tells the FO to fire every gun they have at Luke. As Kylo is unaware that Luke is a force projection, he just believed that Luke was so incredibly powerful he could survive all that, and yet he still goes down to fight him. And when he does this, Poe even mentions that they should help Luke fight Kylo, even after they’ve seen him survive all this.

That is all why I believe that Kylo Ren is one of the most powerful characters yet in SW, especially in the films. 

Thanks for reading this incredibly lengthy post, I’d love to hear your opinions on the matter as long as everything remains civil. Now, let’s see what his character bring in IX.

1956,"I wrote an essay on the film Composition technique used in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, can anyone give me feedback on it?","**Film Composition Essay**


The composition of the iconic final fight scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back symbolizes the relationship between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. At the climax of the duel, as Luke’s hand is amputated by Vader, Luke gradually withdraws from the confrontation, while Vader attempts to persuade Luke to join the Dark Side. This relation is shown through the foundation that both characters stand on, as well as their height levels, and distance from one another.  

 

The foundation that Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker are seen standing on is a reflection of the foundations of the organizations they represent. In the scene, Vader is comfortably and firmly standing on a stong foundation with plenty of space, while Luke can be seen struggling to stand on a narrow surface, desperately holding on to a ledge. The Empire is a galaxy spanning organization with a well-financed government and military body. This can be repeatedly show through the vast amounts of manpower and resources they possess, as well as the way that Vader treats his subordinates as cannon fodder. The expendable nature in which the Empire treats its assets suggests that there are more than enough resources at their disposal for them to comfortably archive their goals, similar to how Vader is shown to have more than enough space to stand on. On the other hand, the Rebel Alliance is a loose coalition of Senators and fringe groups, who fight a guerilla war against the Empire, and oftentimes lose, with even their victories being pyrrhic. During the Battle of Hoth scenes, the internal structures of the Rebel base are shown to be claustrophobic and clustered with crates and items scattered around in a disorganized fashion, with the base having very narrow walkways, and small, tight knit work areas. The Rebels also lack many resources, and the loss of their base of Hoth is shown to be a major loss, while the Empire regularly loses entire Star Destroyers and even a Death Star, yet are relatively unshaken. The characters foot placements are symbolic of the current political and military climates between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance.  

 

 

     The character's height levels in relation to the camera angle of the frame represents the Empires superiority over the Rebel Alliance. In the scene, Darth Vader is shown standing on a higher level than Luke Skywalker, with the camera being at a high angle. Often times directors use a high angle shot to convey an emotion of superiority of one character over another character. This is due to our eyes perceiving an exaggerated image of one character to be much larger than another character, in contrast to the reality of their sizes if both characters were normally standing side by side on an equal surface. From a nitrative perspective, the high angle in this scene reinforces the theme of the Empire being superior to the Rebel’s, as Vader and Luke are both are seen as embodiments of their respective organizations. In the Battle of Hoth we are shown the Rebels make a fighting retreat, and suffer tremendous casualties, while we are also known throughout the films the legions upon legions of Stormtroopers and Star Destroyers that the Empire has at its disposal. The height and camera angle in this scene is significant because it indirectly reinforces the films perception of the Empire as being a militaristically superior to the Rebels, which is also as shown in the duel itself.  

 

 

The body position of the characters as well as their distance from one another in the frame alludes to the ideological clash between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. In the scene, we see Darth Vader with his back towards the camera, which covers the front of his helmet, while Luke’s back is also facing the camera, but his face and expression is clearly visible. Oftentimes when two characters are placed on opposing sides of the frame with a space in-between them, it is used to show their opposing values. The white railing that separates Luke and Vader creates a bright contrast with the grey background as well as Vader's jet-black outfit. The space between them is shown to emphasize their differences, and by association, the organizations they represent. The Empire is an authoritarian military dictatorship that is ruled with an iron fist by Emperor Palpatine. It values conformity and submission above individual expression and free will. This can be shown though the bland and dull uniforms of the Stormtroopers and Imperial personnel, as well as their “no questions asked” attitude towards Vader, which when broken, has dire consequences, Darth Vader is seen as the face of the Empire, who's authority is second only to the Emperor himself, ironically, Vader's facial features are hidden beneath a helmet, and an all-black uniform, giving the viewers a perception of lack humanity and free will, similar to a machine, which is what Vader is partly comprised of. The Rebel Alliance, as its name suggests, is a ragtag group of freedom fighters who joined together in response to the formation of the Empire. It represents libertarianism, free will, and individuality. This can be a seen in almost everything the Rebels do - from fighting back against the oppressive Empire, to freeing slaves in the Star Wars Rebels TV series. The Rebels are also presented in a very unique and vibrant way though their dress patters, often seen wearing very weathered and mixed uniforms. Unlike the Darth Vader and the Stormtroopers, the Rebels faces are clearly visible, this helps the viewers create a personal relationship with the Rebels, as oftentimes it is said that “the eyes are the window to the soul”. The body position and frame distance of the characters in this scene is represents the major differences between the morals and values of the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance.  

 

In conclusion, the composition of scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back symbolizes the relationship between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, through the use of distance, body position, as well as height and camera angle. The aforementioned composition features serve to give the Empire a sense of superiority, strong foundation, and highlight the ideological differences between the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire.

1963,I just watched Solo (sort of?),"To preface, it was recommended to me by my dad who watched it the other week and enjoyed it, and we usually enjoy the same type and film, it is very rare for us to not both like the same film.
Nevertheless I went into watching this film without any bias, I didn't go watch it at the time as I don't tend to go to the cinema and I was busy with university work at the time that it came out. I didn't watch any YouTube videos about it or read any reviews (which I often tend to do) so my opinions were not affected in any sort of way, meaning I went into it with a very open mind and expecting to really enjoy it.
However, without trying to be too hyperbolic it is possibly the the worst Star Wars film I've ever watched and probably the worst film I've watched in quite some time. 
I confess that I only made it halfway through the film but here are some the things that I felt were wrong with the film as a whole.
The colour palette was very washed out. The film relied on too many whites, blacks, greys and browns, much like a DC film. However, while DC films tend to be serious, this film seemed like it was trying to be serious and comedic and most of the jokes just didn't work, due to a mix of the washed out colours and the poor writing (bringing me onto my second point).
The writing was mostly pretty dull, most of the jokes fell flat and the ones that didn't felt flawed and were just there for fan service. None of the characters I felt particularly invested in, except for Chewy, Han, and Lando, and I feel that, that was mainly due to my nostalgia goggles of watching the other Star Wars films. In addition, Lando's robot lieutenant, was weird, it was like they had some weird sexual relationship, and ignoring that, it felt like there was some sort of robot civil rights angle the writers were going for, but that also seemed to fall flat and pull me right out of the action.
In terms of action, due to the washed out colours that felt boring too, the death of the alien and black woman just after that start (can't remember their names) felt predictable and I didn't feel invested in either of their characters. Characters such as Chewy, Han and Lando I also didnt feel much suspense for as I knew they'd be alright, due to the later films. This could be said about all prequels but at least in the case of episode 1, 2 and 3 you saw and felt Anakin and Obi-wan's friendship and relationship grow and deteriorate, whereas Chewy, Han and Lando in this film didn't seem to have any ups and downs in terms of their relationships.
There is more I could say but I think this post is long enough as it is. Overall I'm really disappointed in this film, as it could have explored so much and been much better than it was, but in conclusion it felt like forced fan service and yet another money maker for whoever this one was made by, with the Star Wars label slapped on to put butts on seats and rake in the cash of a once great IP.",StarWars,1548980679,charlieholmes4,35,2,True,2019-01-31
1964,Ahsoka Overstaying her welcome,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting here.  Finished the last season of rebels and I have to say that it did not satisfy like I've read all over the internet.  It really came down to Ahsoka being saved through the world between worlds and living beyond the original trilogy era.  I have been a fan of Ahsoka since the early seasons of Clone Wars.  I think she is a well developed character who's arc in the clone wars and even subsequent return in the Rebels is well done.  However, I'm not a fan of her living past the Twilight of the Apprentice episode.  I thought that was a beautiful, powerful end to her story, and further solidified how far Anakin had fallen as Vader.  I just feel that it cheapens her character because I feel the creators won't end her story and she will continue to survive even if that means introducing time manipulation with the world between worlds.  Just wondering what other people's thoughts are out there and if anyone agrees with me or I'm completely alone. I know she's very popular, I like her, I just feel that her story should have ended with Twilight of the Apprentice.  Looking for a healthy, positive discussion. Fingers crossed.

But the *story* was so bad! We aren't Jedi at all, we're freelance murder monsters with lightsabers and force powers. We don't actually talk to people or try and settle disputes or anything, it's just ""show up, do murder, and receive praise from Luke"".

1982,Claudia Gray's 'Master and Apprentice' novel gets an official synopsis," *An unexpected offer threatens the bond between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as the two Jedi navigate a dangerous new planet and an uncertain future.*


*A Jedi must be a fearless warrior, a guardian of justice, and a scholar in the ways of the Force. But perhaps a Jedi’s most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice.*


*Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn’t Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Council—knowing it would mean the end of their partnership? The simple answer scares him: Obi-Wan has failed his Master.*


*When Jedi Rael Averross, another former student of Dooku, requests their assistance with a political dispute, Jinn and Kenobi travel to the royal court of Pijal for what may be their final mission together. What should be a simple assignment quickly becomes clouded by deceit, and by visions of violent disaster that take hold in Qui-Gon’s mind. As Qui-Gon’s faith in prophecy grows, Obi-Wan’s faith in him is tested—just as a threat surfaces that will demand that Master and apprentice come together as never before, or be divided forever.*

1984,"Who else wants a deep, character-driven, mature, and complex live action Star Wars TV show?","I love both Clone Wars and Rebels and although they have their dark moments, what really irks me is this whole idea that the shows are meant for ""kids."" I believe that so many themes and cool ideas are left unexplored because of this barrier. 

It would be so awesome to experience Star Wars as a full on dark and mature war with intense and realistic violence and wholesome romance and character development.

For example, in SW Rebels, I would have loved to see the Empire as competent force and witness their cruelty. I want to see more expanded romance between not only Kanan and Hera, but also Ezra and Sabine. However, what annoyed me was that the Empire/ villains were portrayed as child's play and had no depth or dimension, Sabine's backstory made little sense (creates weapon at 16?), violence is toned down, and some immature moments, and also some outright weird stuff (space whales??!) 

Now, imagine the show as not only live action (which I'm fine with animation, but I want it to be as realistic as possible) , but every single problem I mentioned and many more were fixed. This show would be AMAZING and probably won an Emmy or something. A deep, mature, and thought-provoking story... I NEED this from Star Wars. Same concept applies to Clone Wars too.

But if they don't have the Knights of Ren in present day, fighting one of the beat fight scenes we've seen in a Star Wars film, Im going to give up and call the entire new trilogy a waste of time.

I'm sorry, but they better be in Episode 9 and have a memorable sequence. I didn't even know those guys in RogueOne before the film and they had one epic last stance. I dgaf if all of the Knights of Ren ultimately die. Just show me them together and why they deserve to be called that. Because so far, they deserve that badass name as much as Kylo Ren deserves and needs to wear that mask. (Even though it's fcking awesome and I wish he never took it off.

2006,What are your favourite in-depth podcasts/youtube channels?,"  

Hi everyone, 

the title basically says it all.  I’m looking for Youtube channels or podcasts (or even websites) that center around Star Wars Lore and the Expanded Universe. I know about channels like Star Wars Explained or EckhartsLadder and I already follow them and watch them extensively! What I’m looking for is a bit different though.

Some of you might be familiar with Radio Westeros or the History of Westeros Podcast which do hourlong In-Depth analysis of “Game of Thrones” and “A Song of Ice and Fire”. And I was wondering if there might be something similar for the Star Wars Universe. The EU is so rich and everything I could find until now are youtube channels with interesting, but short videos (still great in my opinion!)

Whether it’s stuff from the EU most people don’t know about or complex character analysis or just some website/podcast/channel exploring parts of the Star Wars history/galaxy, it’s all great.

Thank you very much in advance and I apologize sincerely if this kind of question is not in line with the typical content around here. ",StarWars,1549028622,nikolaiowich,19,1,True,2019-02-01

2008,"How the First Order is more reminiscent of the Nazis than the Empire ever was - or, A Post About Hux's Incompetence","**How the First Order is More Like the Nazis than the Empire Ever Was, For Better and For Worse**

Before I begin this post is certainly indebted to [Lindsay Ellis' discussion of the First Order and the complicated issue of the use of Nazi imagery in your mainstream Disney movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAVeyXwy3BE), as well as the various comments that made me think about the historical analogues. Unfortunately there are too many redditors for me to credit them all individually. 

One of the points in her video is that the Empire/FO's actual philosophy and politics are kinda nonsense, and I won't be talking about that here (though I assume both have the same anti-alien human-centric racism and all of that). This is more about the story of the Star Wars movies. 

**** 

It's no secret that George Lucas used a lot of Nazi imagery for the Empire in *Star Wars.* It ranges from the obvious (calling your foot soldiers Stormtroopers) to the aesthetic, with Lucas [presenting a cold, authoritative, military command structure](https://www.starwars.com/news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-imperial-officers). (That's a great article by Cole Horton if you haven't seen it before). 

Similarly, the rise of the Empire in the prequels is pretty reminiscent of countless historical coups, [but the Nazis are one inspiration](https://www.starwars.com/news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-rise-of-an-empire). (That's another article from Horton). In broad strokes, someone is genuinely elected, but engineers a crisis to be voted emergency powers, and proceeds to dismantle the democracy that got them to their position in the first place.  

But here's one glaring difference between the real historical Nazis and Palpatine's Empire as we see it in Episodes I through VI: the Empire is cold, efficient, and competent.

Palpatine is a master manipulator that starts a war and is the leader of both sides (secretly in the case of the Separatists). He creates every significant event with an expert touch, and the war accomplishes exactly what he wants. 

Tarkin, the face of the Empire in the first Episode we ever see, is the embodiment of cold efficiency. Strip away the sci-fi nature of the setting and Cushing wouldn't be out of place in any film about a skilled military officer. He's defeated and killed in the Death Star's explosion, but he's never shown to make a real blunder or mistake; not like he left that exhaust port open, right? 

****

""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William Shirer is one of the most in-depth histories of Germany under the Nazis. Shirer was there in person as a newspaper reporter for most of Hitler's rise and for 1,245 pages, he details the regime's decline and end. 

I've read this entire book but there's no need for you to do all of this to get my point across. Instead, [just read this article](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/hitlers-military-incompetence-did-it-cost-the-third-reich-the-war.html). 

Popular culture and our own memory of history tends to depict the Nazis like the Empire a lot of the time. They were the ultimate military machine, the ultimate villains. After crushing France, the biggest and best land army in Europe, in 6 short weeks, we can surely say they were hyper-competent from a military tactics perspective... right?

The truth, as ever, is a mixed bag. The *blitzkrieg* was certainly unexpected and worked like a charm. But Hitler made mistake after mistake in his military planning - Letting the British evacuate the majority of their army at Dunkirk. Opening a second front on Russia instead of finishing the job in Europe. Invading Russia in winter. Declaring war on the United States after Pearl Harbor, when Japan was too far from the scene to help in any meaningful way. 

Hitler was evil, scary, a mad genius in some respects. At the same time, he was an incompetent fool. 

****

One of the biggest complaints about General Hux is that he isn't scary enough in TLJ. After a chilling speech (which makes no secret of its Hitler inspiration) and ordering the firing of Starkiller Base, wiping out the New Republic Senate and its fleet, he is primarily comic relief in Episode 8, the whipping boy of Snoke and Kylo and treated like a fool by Poe and the Resistance. 

One of the biggest complaints about the First Order's actions in that same movie is their arrogance and incompetence. Instead of finishing the Resistance off, they ""play with their food"" via a slow space chase, ultimately letting their prey escape on Crait after Luke's Force projection stalls them for too long. 

To me, these things just tie them even more closely to the real historic Nazis, who were themselves this mixture of a quick-striking, hyper-competent military force and complete idiots that bungled most strategic decisions during the course of the war. If SKB is the 6 week invasion of France, the space chase is their Dunkirk. 

You wouldn't catch Tarkin making the strategic errors Hux does in TLJ, or provoking Vader. On that note, Tarkin is a far better military commander than Hitler, and less of an expy or direct comparison the way Hux is. 

[Perhaps that's a hint as to another one Lucas' approach to historical comparisons with the Empire once he got to ROTJ](https://nypost.com/2014/09/21/how-star-wars-was-secretly-george-lucas-protest-of-vietnam/). The Empire loses in the end, but not because of their military incompetence; it's because all the might of their fleet, infantry, and walkers gets bogged down in hostile terrain against unfamiliar guerrilla tactics... 

****

**Obviously you don't have to like TLJ, Hux, or the First Order.** But I thought the conversation around them as opposed to the Empire is a very interesting one and I'm a history nerd, hence this post. ",StarWars,1549031515,Super_Nerd92,20,1,True,2019-02-01

2014,Solo: A Star Wars Story did one thing incredibly well that it really doesn't get enough credit for,"TL;DR this is the first Star Wars movie where people really behave like people and are driven by attraction and interpersonal relationships. The fact that so many of their conflicts have to do with their feelings for one another grounds them as real people who can get hurt, and not just by lightsabers or laser blasts.

Now, I love every film in the saga, but before Solo, characters in Star Wars didn’t really act like real people. Part of this is because the series is family friendly and portrayed relationships within the confines of the PG rating, but I didn’t really notice what was missing from the movies until Solo finally got it right. To put it simply: characters in this movie acknowledge and are motivated by their sexuality. Han is in love with Qi’ra, and we can actually see this, we’re not just told over and over again that they’re in love, because they behave like two young people in love, and later on like two young people trying to deal with how different their relationship has become. Because so many of the conflicts between characters in this movie are interpersonal and not connected to fighting some larger fight, the characters feel richer and more developed. They have big personalities as well as subtle quirks that add weight to their wins and losses. 

Han in this movie is a kid with a dream. Then he gets isolated from all that he’s previously known and is an Imperial grunt for years while everybody moves on without him. That’s compelling! When he sees Qi’ra again, the contrast between who they were and who they are now is beautifully done. Despite fighting for three years to get back home, Han has a singular dream that he won’t let go of. He grows more over the course of the botched heist and subsequent Kessel adventure than he did during those three years, and that’s because he is finally forced to face loss and accept that his dream was only a fantasy. And it’s not just Han and Qi’ra. 

Remember when Lando’s relationship with L3 was announced and a bunch of people got upset? That turned out fine. We were able to see that Lando, this cool scoundrel, has the capacity to get his heart broken BY A ROBOT. It was interesting to see a robot acting less robotic about sex and romantic feelings than characters in the prequels and original trilogy acted. Let’s take a look at the major romantic relationships prior to Solo. 

Luke and Leia – before they know they’re related, we see that there’s an attraction there. Luke doesn’t know that she’s his sister before he goes off to become a Jedi. Then, for all we know in canon, he never finds a partner and eventually dies. That should be tragic, and the fear of taking on this ancient religion and dying alone should be a consideration for a guy who grew up lonely on a desert planet. 

Leia and Han – what’s considered to be the greatest romance in the saga came out of nowhere. We see it grow over an undisclosed amount of time on the Falcon, but their declaration of love feels premature. There’s some passion, but it’s not nearly as convincing, as, say, any of the dynamics between Indiana Jones and his love interests. I only bring up Indiana Jones because of the Lucas/Ford connection and the fact that those movies made us believe characters were passionate about each other even with the PG rating. 

Anakin and Padme – this is the one that feels the least authentic to me. Part of that is because of the huge missed opportunity. Anything wooden or awkward in their courtship could be explained away by the weird, cult-like nature of the Jedi. But in the prequels, we’re surrounded by Jedi, and the non-Jedi characters are just as closed off to their sexuality. Padme, a senator, is somehow just as unable to get involved as Anakin, a Jedi is. Because she's a senator? 

Now in Solo, there are no more Jedi, and the characters are rough, scrappy underworld types who – and this might be the most important part – are not fighting wars. Cassian Andor doesn’t have time to go off and fall in love, having devoted himself to the Rebellion. There was maybe a romance between him and Jyn suggested that was either lost in reshoots or never existed. Not having characters either be devoted to an ancient religion or part of some huge galaxy-wide conflict allows for them to live their own lives and do human things. Betrayals sting more, and cynical characters’ cynicism feels more justified when the space opera elements are just in the background and the movie is about characters falling down and getting back up again. 

For all of these reasons, Solo is currently my favorite Star Wars movie. Some of the stuff in it is really, really dumb, but I have an easier time suspending my disbelief when it comes to plot contrivances as long as the characters act like people, and Solo delivers when it comes to believable characterizations. I love all the characters in this movie, and I believe their relationships, and it’s really a shame we’re probably not getting more of these. I don’t dislike any Star Wars content, but this is the sort of content that speaks to me the most, and I’d love to see more of it someday if Disney deems it financially viable.

2029,The Star Wars name game,"This is a game my brothers and I came up with while going on family road trips, and I thought I'd share. The idea from Star Wars names being so weird, but at the same time so intuitive, that you can find them everywhere.

Basically, you have to naturally come up with names that sound Star Wars-y by looking at what's around you. By naturally, I mean it just has to flow from the already existing word(s). You can eliminate letters, but not change the order of letters. You can also add apostrophes or dashes if you think they fit. Here are some examples:

The Last Jedi = Elas Di

Samsung Galaxy = Amsun Lax

Listerine Total Care = Li'Terin Totalca

It's pretty simple, but a great way to pass time in the car. We'd often argue about whether names we saw on billboards/signs actually *sounded* like they belonged in universe. Unfortunately, now I'm plagued by seeing Star Wars names everywhere. 

Anyway, I've made a subreddit /r/starwarsnames for me and my bros, and anyone else who'd like to play.

2030,Stats on the diversity of Star Wars books and how many are tie-ins versus original stories,"So this is something I have been wondering about for a while. I like stats and numbers and think it makes what can be a muddy picture much clearer. I wanted to do this because of some of the ideas I've had about what kind of stories are told as well as some of the comments I've heard about what stories are told.

So I went though the list of canon novels for adults and YR. I didn't add the little junior novels into this. I also only accounted for ones we knew about. 

Here are some things I noticed. 

Of the 22 books that we know the plot for 16 are movie/show tie ins (with 1 being episodes right from TCW that were never made) and 4 are character bios that also act as rear door tieins to shows and movies. The only three that tell their own stories are Tarkin and Heir which were both originally going to be Legends stories untill the Canon swap and they were pulled over. And the second Thrawn novel. 

I could see arguing that the aftermath series is telling its own story but to me it just seems like its entire point is to set up how the war ended and first order was created so you can understand the politics of the sequel trilogy. so if you think it was its own story then by all means take away three from the Tie in pot and put it in the original story the counter

Out of the 26 books we have 12 of them have female leads and 13 of them have male leads. However out of that number all the ones staring male characters are movie/show tie ins and star a movie show character. While only 7 of the 12 female led books being about a established show/movie character. 

Of the  stories with both a A plot and a B plot it breaks down to where in the 10 stories with a male lead all but one has a female lead for the B plot with that one being Catalyst where the plot kept going between Orso and Krennic. 

For the 7 female leads only 3 of the B plots involve a male POV character with the rest either having a female POV character or no B plot. 

So when it comes to A plots its mostly even even if we have most of the male characters being the already established ones. However it seems that male led books are mandated to have a female B plot lead while female led books are not. 

I'm not really sure what to do about this information or what it says about the state of star wars other than they really don't let the EU tell its own stories anymore (I'm hoping Alphabet squadron is a sign of that changing. and the master and Apprentice book not being a tie in to the Clone Wars sounds like it could be as well) and that they don't really want to risk much on new characters. Maybe one or two books a year with new characters not connected to the movies and games.  Also female and male representation is basically equal when it comes to main characters so people can not complain about that so much now. 

We have a few more more characters of colour which is nice. With that actually coming from many of the new introduced characters. sadly though the same cannot be said for aliens with the only major alien characters being the ones from the TV shows.

after getting more information on the books this morning I wish I had waited a bit to make this post since we now know more about the theme park books and about master and Apprentice.

2042,Has anyone ever written a fan fiction reset of Episode 7-9?,"I don't know how this community feel about Disney's take on the saga. There is a good reason why so many fans were enraged with what they have done... they have really reduced this epic saga into a shallow and unremarkable space fantasy series. I have no problem with people that think the new episodes are great... a lot of people just have an opposing point of view that must be equally respected. We are not deliberately trashing the new movies... we are just sharing our honest opinion about it... it just happens to be so damn low. 

With that said... I would love to know if anyone has ever written a fan fiction that shares Mark Hamill's vision of the universe. I have heard that the Disney's movies are based on &gt;!the ""grey"" balance of the force, and that Sith to End so must the Jedi - explaining why Luke wants the Jedi to end!&lt;. I think this is just an incredibly weak philosophical approach to the character and the exploration of what the balance actually means. It would been much cooler to explore Luke's internal conflict about entertaining the idea of ending the Jedi, but not giving into it. There was an opportunity to explore deeply philosophical questions through the lenses of the Jedi. That opportunity was entirely lost to frivolous, unemotional dialog, and horrific character development.  

If they had taken the route of SLOWLY transitioning  the focus from the older generation of characters into a new one they would had been able to create 6 new amazing star wars movies instead of the three farts in the wind (I know the third movie is out... but I have absolutely lost any hope that it can redeem itself from EP 7 and 8).

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, I would LOVE if Disney apologized and simple reset the trilogy and publicly awarded Mark Hamill with an important creative role. He understands so well the philosophical depth of the Jedi, and he would surely be critical in hand picking a director that shares and understands the importance of honoring those views.

2063,My thoughts on Episode VII!,"This sub is well known for the overall positivity and I am very glad for it. I would like though to offer my critiques on Force Awakens and why I think it is a very underwhelming film.

As everyone else, I was very excited about this movie when it was being promoted. I watched all the trailers, watched a lot of videos about possible plot threads as well as every interview that involved someone working on the film. When I saw the film with my family, I loved it and I thought it was a very good continuation of the original six films made by George Lucas. However, through time I started to realise what I consider some glaring flaws in this film. It is heavily based on nostalgia, using phrases, words or elements that were already used in the previous films. In my opinion, JJ and his creative team sacrificed creativity in order to make a very safe film. The second part of the film, especially after Takodana feels like ANH 2.0, since there is a massive Death Star 3.0, a trench run battle and so on. 

As far as I know, Episode VII was due to release on May 2015, but Abrams alongside Kasdan and Kennedy asked Disney to push the date back to December, as it happened. If my memory serves me well, the group also asked to push it further back to May 2016 in order to work more on the script. However, Disney rejected this plead and the release date was finalised for the Christmas of 2015. From my point of view, this sort of thing was obvious in the plot. There was no creative plan since the Resistance vs First Order plot is a rehash of Empire vs Rebels, Han is back to smuggling, Leia is a general, Luke is the new Obi-Wan, hell, even Snoke can be seen as a Palpatine 2.0. Jakku is another desert planet which may as well copy Tatooine. Maz Kanata's place is honestly another lesser version of Cantina in ANH, as well as the overall plot of the film.

Just to clarify, I really like TLJ and I think some of the aforementioned elements were improved on with the sequel released in 2017. I do like Han, Leia and Luke in ST, I think Snoke is a solid, or was, a solid villain and I think Jakku has some substance to it since it is a very historic place in the new canon. What saddens me though is that I think that Episode VII wasn't made with pure love for SW (I think the rest of the new films have been made with love for SW) since it feels more like a reboot/tribute to Star Wars and what makes it iconic, rather than create a fresh and imaginative instalment. Ultimately, I think that it is quite shallow since it doesn't have a lot going for it other than Disney's need to restart the franchise. Still, there is some good stuff in it. I enjoy Kylo and all of his scenes, Rey, Finn and Poe are cool. The best part of this film, though, is the avid speculation that followed. I can have a fun time with it, but it is undoubtedly the worst SW film in my opinion.

What do you think? I know many of you love Episode VII and I would like to hear your views on what I stated. Take care!",StarWars,1549123170,panmpap,21,1,True,2019-02-02
2064,"""No one asked for it.""","I've been seeing this particular criticism of the films around a lot since the recent spinoffs. It seems rather empty to me, so far as criticisms go, but maybe I just don't get it.

What was the last release that WAS asked for? The prequel trilogy was in the works before the OT was finished. It was promised before anyone could really ask for it. It seems more that the request was, ""more Star Wars movies,"" which is generic enough that movies like Solo and Rogue One should surely qualify.

How about movies that have been requested that haven't been made? I'm trying to think if any even exist. Boba Fett? KOTOR? Thrawn? Obi Wan drew a lot of hype, but I didn't remember anyone asking for it before the film development was announced.

Isn't it rather more reasonable to expect better quality Star Wars movies if we let the artists choose the aspects of the universe that inspire them, rather than insisting they talk about the aspects of the universe that inspire us as the audience? 

But as they say in the memes, ""Change My Mind.""

2081,Am I the only one who has started to prefer the anthology films?,"Honest request for discussion here, I swear this isn't just a Last Jedi putdown fest (I hated it but won't get into that). Like the Force Awakens was decent enough for the start of a new trilogy and I'm looking forward to episode IX since Johnson won't be touching it but overall the NT just feels kind of underwhelming to me.   


I feel completely the opposite way towards the anthology films, both solo and Rogue One so far, and I'm hoping for many more. I feel like these one offs are a great way to explore different periods in galactic history that aren't exactly big or important enough to warrant a whole trilogy. I absolutely loved Rogue one from the big bits like seeing Peter Cushing recreated for Grand Moff Tarkin or the battle for Skariff or Vader being this big bogey man storming down the hallway like some sort of demon down to the small little details like how Saw Gurerra's troops used the same tactics in battle that they learned from Anakin, Obi Wan, and the Clones in TCW. That was just such a small detail but a huge love letter to the diehard fans. Solo was fantastic too IMO, I'll admit I went in with low expectations after TLJ but left the theater with a huge smile on my face.  Once again the callbacks to TCW were greatly appreciated with the appearance of Maul and the Pike Syndicate. It may not have been an epic battle or good vs. evil but I'm okay with that, it gave us a glimpse of a part of the galaxy that we would NEVER see in a trilogy, or if we did it would be done poorly \*cough\* canto bight \*cough\*.   


Neither of them were perfect obviously, but they left me wanting so much more. I want to see the stories of soldiers on both sides! An aging clone dealing with the transition from republic to empire, a smuggler or bounty hunter trying to survive the lower levels of Couresant, a battalion of Republic Commandos trying to liberate an entire world from Sith Empire occupation. Jedi vs Sith is always fun, but it's been getting stale to me as of late. I'm also so sick of the Skywalker family (Kylo included), it's been 8 movies of the same family making the same mistakes and we need a break. Star Wars is such a HUGE universe with so many different eras rich with material for exploring and I'd love to see more of that in movies and maybe even television shows going forward.

The old canon didn't just create new weapons and say ""This weapon was used by the empire under this and this period..."" it also said what it was made of, what company made it, the story behind it, who the maker of the weapon was, how he got the idea. All of these small but amazing details were mostly released in manuals or books, and i can't stress enough how much more alive that made the universe feel.

BEFORE ANYONE WANTS TO SAY THIS MOVIE DESTROYED STAR WARS - no... just no. We may have seen stuff that has never been mentioned or seen in the previous films but how else would you expand on the uses of the Force. 

As we all know now, the OG trilogy gave us the Emperor as an ultimate villain, but it never said what HIS backstory was. It was never told where HE came from. Star Wars was thought to be concluded at that time (from at least what my dad told me) in 1983 and it was never expected that more movies would come out. Why didn't people make a big hue and cry back then, like they're doing with Snoke now? So what if they immediately killed Snoke? He is basically a parallel of the emperor right now. For all we know, 20-30 years down the line, they'll make a set of movies based on the time between the OG Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy, explaining everything with Snoke (well, they still haven't explained EVERYTHING with the Emperor's backstory but still, bear with me).

Same goes for the parallel b/w the First Order and the Empire. For 16 years, we had no idea over how the Empire rose and took over almost the entire galaxy. No one made a big hue and cry back then. We all took it on face value that - the Empire is evil, it has taken over the galaxy and it is our protagonist's job to stop it. But now, when JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson decide to make the First Order's backstory a mystery, the true ""fanboys"" of Star Wars want to scrap and remake the VIIIth movie by raising funds.

Another topic of criticism was Rey's parentage. When it was revealed (or maybe not yet, JJ can still change that shiz) that her parents were no one special, everyone lost their minds. Why can't the fan base and the audience accept the fact that maybe Rey wasn't born to anyone special? That anyone could come from anywhere? Mind you, we still have no idea how Anakin was created, but you don't see any hue or cry in that, you see only theories like maybe Palps manipulated the midichlorians to create ""The Chosen One."" But now, if Rey's parentage is JUNK TRADERS, EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS *insert Joker gif*

Now a lot of people see Luke's character as a problem, but I see it as experience. Look at Luke now. He's an old hermit that's hidden himself away from the galaxy due to guilt. He's recognized what happened to him after the fall of the Empire. He suffered from too much self-confidence and it leads to his downfall. He thought he could harvest the powerhouse that is Ben Solo, and turn him into a new generation Jedi. His pride blinded him.
I've heard people say that ""If Luke could find hope in an evil man who's slaughtered millions and turned to the Dark Side, why couldn't he find hope in his own nephew, for whom he only saw a vision."" Remember, what he saw was far beyond what he imagined. ""Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring pain and destruction and death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become."" He then activated his lightsaber out of instinct and fear but he didn't bring the blade down until Ben turned around. He even screamed, ""BEN, NO!"" He doesn't want to take the chance that another few million will die in case he turns to the Dark Side (which they already have). But he doesn't kill Ben instantly either because it's human hesitation. His drastic character change probably is attuned to the fact that he's been all over the galaxy in the time between OG Trilogy and the new Trilogy. He's probably seen things you and I haven't even dreamed of in his pursuit of peace for the galaxy. He blames himself for Ben joining the First Order and Snoke. He feels very guilty and wants nothing to do with anyone else. I would say that the new Luke is appropriate, given what he's probably done and known.
And oh, btw, I love the scene in the end with the Force Hologram. You may say ""It isn't really Star Wars material."" Remember, Rian Johnson took the inspiration from a Star Wars book defining a set of Force Powers and he's tweeted that one to prove it. The epicness of that scene. Some would say Luke's death was underwhelming. Simply fading away into the Force isn't what we wanted. But I find it amazing. One of Luke's most defining moments in the movies is him looking out into Tatooine's multiple suns. I would say that's where his journey really began. His end was similar, as he passed while looking at a similar sky, with multiple suns. And that's where his journey ended. But he’s probably still in Ep 9 as a ghost, haunting Kylo and helping Rey. I do hate the fact that Luke and Han never had a reunion on screen though...

Now sure, the movie had some general stupid things and scenes. I'll even list them all -

Rose's stupid dialogue in the end... Finn was set up for the perfect sacrifice. His Final Act would have been so cool. But no, this bitch had to intervene.

Luke throwing the lightsaber away. I facepalmed so hard when I first saw that movie in cinemas. Now sure, from the movie's point of view, it was a natural reaction from Luke because he wanted nothing to do with the Jedi anymore but from the audience's point of view, it was underwhelming as hell for two years worth of waiting. I wanted him to open the blue blade, wave it around a little bit and ask as to how Rey got the saber. THEN he could've thrown it away and said that he wanted nothing to do with it.

Rey is stupid OP. (As a person who's started watching tons of Anime, it isn't surprising to see a person become really OP in a short time. Hint: Gohan and Elder Kai, Kaneki with Jason.) But it is just underwhelming as an audience to see that the Resistance's ray of hope is a Mary Sue. I’m pretty happy with the actress, she doesn’t make it cringy and she’s not overly sexualised either. She acts really well. I hope to see her more often in other movies.

Holdo. Man wtf. I mean sure, her scene with the Suicide bombing was epic. But everything else with her was so trash. If Admiral Ackbar had survived the initial bombing and then taken the role of leadership, I would have been much happier.

THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE FIRST ORDER CAN'T CATCH UP TO THE RESISTANCE. Or rather, it doesn't want to. Remember, they had only 18 hours of fuel. Hux does not think they had anything else up their sleeve. He thought he would obliterate them while also giving them a sense of impending doom in their last hours. 

All you GoT fans wanted more of Phasma. Eh. I couldn't care more or less. It was fine as is. How would they add more role to her in the current story? Please tell me your ideas.

Some people might say Kylo is a whiny little b****. I kinda agree, but how do you top a villain like Vader on cinema? Plus, he is great for memes and fanfic. Plus, he's an evolving character. I like him.

Overall, I don't think its a bad movie. I personally loved it when it came out, and I would still give it a solid 8.5/10. It has its issues but I'm pretty sure Rian couldn't help much in some of those, with Kathleen riding the Star Wars back on top of the feminism horse.
And yeah, that's my post. Please leave your thoughts down below but try not to slam me too hard as I am extremely sick while writing this post and have not left my bed for two days.

I mean, on the face of it? It sounds dreadful. A dude who was cut in half, who plummeted fuck knows how deep down a hole, somehow survives on pure hatred looking like a mutated spider. Despite that, they really fixed his character. He went from a silent assassin who looks cool, to a manipulative, cunning warrior hell bent on revenge. I love how it showed different sides to Maul. His pure anger, probably the most I've seen from a villain in canon. His love for Savage. And his cruelty to Obi-Wan/Satine/countless others. By the end of his story, it really feels like he goes from someone relying on his power in TCW to someone using his wits to manipulate people into getting what he wants (Rebels). His end is perfect as well. It shows just how tragic Darth Maul is. He goes from a Cool looking character &gt; Deranged &gt; Physcopath &gt; Power hunger manipulator &gt; To an almost Anti hero.

2112,Confused by the black and white story telling.,"Hello star wars subreddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a long time coming, but I am always confused by the black and white portrayal of charactors in Star Wars and the lack of grittiness. The movies seem so shallow and characters are polarised. Good wins bad, fin.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I fancy starwars' setting, I enjoy the movies like ""the shield"" where the audience is taken through an ""antagonist's "" mind and think like him or ""The Captain"" where we see a character's change by his unfortunate surroundings. You are unable to deem them as hero/villain but only as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question, are the movies deliberately set up this way. If so, are there any good ""none main franchise"" movies that explore the different shades of gray or just tell a person' story.",StarWars,1546358133,mqshawn,7,1,True,2019-01-01

2115,"A question about ""What if's""","As many fans know, there were a lot of interesting ""What if,"" stories in legends based on the original trilogy.  Some were ridiculous, a few completely out of character (Yoda crashing the death Star onto Coruscant comes to mind), but ultimately they were fascinating and a really good way to draw eyes to a different format. 

Interestingly enough, the series never bothered much with prequel era, which despite it's flaws, was more than ripe with interesting what if stories. Say what you will about George's (in)ability to direct actors or film an interesting dramatic scene in his later years, he was/is still extremely good at writing scenarios that balance on a pinhead.  Where if one thing goes differently everything single thing that follows would be dramatically changed. 

I've long felt that if Disney truly wants to do something different with Star Wars, exploring these ""What if?"" Scenarios would be an amazing departure. Perhaps on a Clone Wars style T.V. Show. Or in an (obviously) non-canon movie. Something other than a comic book. 

If such a thing ever came about, what scenes and their subsequent changes would you want to see played out? 

For me, the top two are easily ""Mace waits till Yoda and Obi-Wan return to go to confront Palpantine, and asks Anakin to stall him by returning to him and pretending to go along, with him,"" and ""Yoda and Obi-wan do not split up to face the Emperor and Vader, but both confront Vader together.""

I was also really impressed by the political aspect of things, I felt this show really expanded on the politics that were present in the prequels and made the pay off of the Republic forming into the empire 10x better.

Ahch-To is still a secret to Kylo so it'd be easy to justify Rey finding a crystal there to build a new lightsaber, either from Luke's green sabre or another spare crystal Luke would have undoubtedly found in his travels.  It's not like it needs to be built out of the remnants of Anakin's so this isn't so much a question of necessity for the story, it's a question of preference.

Which would you prefer?

* Rey rebuild Anakin's saber and use it to fight Kylo in 9
* Rey build her own design out of the components of Anakin's broken hilt
* Rey build her own from other components and keep Anakin's broken hilt
* Rey build her own from other components and also rebuild Anakin's broken hilt
* Other

I'm not sure it could be pulled off in a way that wasn't ham-fisted but I love the idea of Rey having a double-sabre made from both Anakin and Luke's crystals, green and blue; the symbol of the Skywalker legacy risen up to counter the man that would tarnish it.

2154,The Last Jedi is divisive because it's realistic,"Now for the record, I don't mean realistic as in, ""plot point z makes sense because plot points x and y,"" I mean that it tries to be relatable. I'm not here to argue about whether it succeeds, my point is that it's devisive simply because it tried.

Star Wars has always been this impossible fantasy world that could never happen in real life. For some people I think this made Star Wars an escape, for others it made Star Wars a bit too intangible.

I think Rian Johnson tried very hard to make his film relatable to people's lives. The First Order chasing The Resistance plays out more like naval combat that space combat, and many characters receive arguably too much focus on their very human flaws.

For some people, making this movie more relatable helped them to identify with Star Wars and imagine themselves in that world more than ever before. Regardless of it's accuracy to character, people who identify with Luke or Poe or Rey's struggles in this film are more likely to give it a pass because they feel for these characters in ways they may not have before. They know what it's like to have a stubborn stupid boss like Holdo, and appreciate that fantasy war hero Poe has to deal with the same shit.

Alternatively, for people that love Star Wars because it's a fantasy escape separate from their world this movie really did ruin Star Wars by bringing it too close to home. People who sat down in the theaters after a long hard week at work didn't want to be reminded of their stupid boss. They don't want a lesson in failure from Finn and Rose, they want to believe in a world where anything can happen. Certainly if they wanted to be reminded that the wealthy elite control the galaxy they would have just watched the news.

But beyond that there were certainly people that didn't even identify with this movie or the characters in it, and this movie left them in the dust. TLJ doubles down on the flaws of its characters and so if you don't identify with them you probably got taken right out of the movie. Being left to sit there and analyze the movie from the outside means people are more likely to notice the movie's flaws and of course they won't enjoy the movie. Because this movie tries to be realistic, it makes the fantasy elements stand out more. This is the first Star Wars movie to receive so much criticism for it's depiction of physics, despite the fact that it's a fantasy space world with a mystical force where physics never mattered. I believe that the reason the discrepancies are more noticable in TLJ is because the rest of the movie tries to be more realistic.

My point with this post is not to convince people that this movie is good or bad, but to give both sides a new perspective to consider. I know this won't apply to everyone, but try to consider that a person's enjoyment of this movie may go deeper than the movies quality",StarWars,1546399463,JediKnight67,0,1,True,2019-01-01

2160,HOLDO DID NOTHING WRONG,"I don't know if this has been done before, but what the hell. I think Holdo was justified in withholding information from Poe. This is because she suspects that there is a spy on board. Not knowing which of her crew is a spy, she assumed everyone is a spy. From the higher ups such as Poe, all the way down to the lowest ranking members such as... a mechanic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasoning for why Rose is an Imperial Spy**

1. Escape Pod Room: She states that she prevented deserters. But what if she is just trying to keep all resistance member in one place so that they can all be destroyed.
2. Canto Bight: The Gang™ fly to Canto Bight and immediately get caught for illegal parking. Rose must have parked there so that they'd get caught so they couldn't fulfill their mission. How do I know that Rose was piloting the craft? Rose is shown to be an adept pilot along with being a mechanic, so she knows the ins and outs of the craft. An extra bit of proof is that she is the one who explains to Finn to engage his mono-ski during the Not-Hoth battle. Also Rose had the ability to catch up to Finn when she was nowhere in sight her her little rinky-dink Speeder. Not only this, but we see Rose piloting the escape craft back to Snoke's ship.
3. Dark Side Rose also steers Finn down the destructive pathway of the dark side. After saving the animals and destroying the city, he says: ""It was worth it though. To tear up that town make 'em hurt."" Similar to Anakin's rampage through the Sand People.
4. Power Breaker Trap: How would the First Order know when and where to trap The Gang™ if not for a spy?
5. Not-Hoth Battle: Finn was about to destroy the battering ram by ramming his vehicle into it. Guess who """"""""""saves Finn""""""""""?
6. Love: ""That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love."" As we all know, Jedi are said to forgo individual bonds such as family... and love. Do you remember someone else who fought for love? How did that turn out?

**Lesser Reasons**

1. Haysian Smelt medallion: Somewhat reminiscent to a Yin-Yang symbol. This would play into the light and dark aspect. If Paige is seen as a Resistance hero, Rose might be seen as an Imperial hero.
2. Name: Rose. Look good on the outside, but if you delve deeper, you might get caught in its thorns. Similar to the franchises on-the-nose naming system: Vader = Father (Dutch); Sidious = Insidious; Grievous = Grievous; Maul = Maul.
3. It's Like Pottery, They Rhyme: Why did Finn and Rose go on an important mission together? Why not have Poe tag along? Because they rhyme. Finn was a Stormtrooper gone rogue, while Rose is supposedly a Resistance fighter but is in actuality an Imperial spy.

&amp;#x200B;

**There is no gathering the rose without being pricked by the thorns.**

2161,"How Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, and Lucasfilm could have made Episode 8 a stronger movie","There was a lot of negativity toward Episode 8 but I did not happen to read or see anything that offered a proposed solution of how the film could have been improved.   So here are my thoughts; please comment as I'd like to know yours. 

Before I start,  i believe the reasons why fans thought Ep 8 lacked substance was simply that the characters lacked substance,  which in turn was because of the dilution of including too many new character introductions.  In short, I would have taken out the scenes with Rose, DJ and Holdo and repurpose that screen time with fortifying the scenes with Rey, Luke, Kylo, and the force training/balance scenes.  There were definitely some good ideas incubated in the movie; they just needed more screen time to ripen. 

Additionally, I think it was a mistake to kill off Phasma in Episode 8.  Second, it was too early for Rey and Kylo to team up to kill Snoke.  Rian Johnson should have waited to do this at Episode 9 to buy more time again for Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Luke's characters to be mature (along with Tallie, Paige, Poe, and everyone else's).  Then their later battle scenes with their respective counterparts would have been more epic.

As examples, I think Ep 8 would have had more plot gravitas if:

1. We physically saw some more OT characters in the opening battle and later with Leia getting blown out of the cruiser, as I think we needed some elements here that maintained a strong connection to the original trilogy to garner immediate substance and buy-in from the getgo.

2.  Tallison Lindra (the lead A wing pilot) and Paige (the bomber who dropped the bombs) were the ones that go on the separate mission with Finn to Canto Bight or wherever to garner more aid from the Allies.  Maybe these New Trilogy folks bump into some Original Trilogy characters or characters from prior movies along the way (Lobot?  General Nadine?  Jedi survivors of Order 66?) before trying to reach the Allies.
Snoke and the First Order intercepts them at some point.  

3.  Do more with Yoda mentoring Luke and his forgotten purpose in parallel with with Rey's training.  Leave the force connection between Kylo and Rey in the movie - this was good in my opinion.

4. Have Rey and Chewbacca leave Achto Island suddenly because Rey senses Finn, Tallison, and Paige in dire trouble (as Luke did with Han when he left from Degobah)

5.  Have Phasma kill Paige and/or Tallie during their side mission before ADMIRAL ACKBAR (not Holdo) crashes into Snoke's ship while the resistance transports escape to Crait.  Finn barely escapes with a shuttle,  Rey can't find him or the others in time, so heads to Crait.

6.  See more details behind the technology of AT-STs and AT-M6 walkers, and detail their heightened evolutions from the Empire's versions of the AT-AT and the AT-ST.  If they are going to rehash old technology, they should highlight it with some back story.

7.  Have Finn enact his revenge on Phasma in Ep 9, not 8.

8.  Luke and Kylo fight in Ep 9, not 8 - Kylo still being dedicated to Snoke in Ep 8. 

8.  Have Rey and Snoke fight in Ep 9.  (with  Kylo circling back after his confrontation (and realization from Luke that he should not have killed Han) to assist Rey, just as Vader did with Luke in Ep 6).

9.  And since we never get to see Han, Luke, and Leia in the same room, maybe handle that with flashbacks of events since Ep. 6. 

10.  Forshadow Lando Calrissian for Ep 9 via:  distress calls to Bespin, the flashbacks, or through the events from Tallie, Paige, and Finn's mission.

Most of the time force manipulation of objects is done on a singular item (i.e. x-wing, a droid, lightsabers, etc.) but occasionally force users will throw around a couple crates at a time.  So my question is, hypothetically, could a force user “throw” sand with the force?  Or are there too many individual particles of sand to actually manipulate them?  As Yoda says, “size matters not” but does quantity matter?  As for water I can’t recall a time in the CU where Force users manipulate water, is that because it falls under the same rules as sand?

2174,Star Wars movies are a tv show now,"Streaming services have been redefining what a show can be. Episodes can be longer, and seasons can be shorter. The new season of Game of Thrones will only have 6 episodes, most of which will be about the length of an average Star Wars movie. By that logic, and the fact that they are already called episodes, it's not hard to classify Star Wars as a season of tv, and I think that Disney has.

Let's look at episodes 1-9 has one season on television, the ""Skywalker Season."" If we think of IX has the finale to that season, then the only thing it has to do is conclude the Skywalker character arcs and write off the characters that won't be returning. Disney has promised that Episode IX will resolve the Skywalker saga, not that it will conclude the entire universe. Indeed, it seems foolish to me to assume that Disney will just end their storyline so quickly after acquiring Star Wars, especially when they are opening a theme park about it months before IX.

If Disney is planning to continue Star Wars past episode IX, then they would not use IX to end their storylines, they would use it to set up the ""next season"" much like a tv show would. They will set up some conflict that they hope everyone will be excited enough to see resolved in the new movies. This brings me to episodes 7, 8, and 9.

Love that they did or not, Force Awakens and Last Jedi wrote Star Wars into a corner that seems impossible to resolve in one movie. Many are speculating how IX can find a satisfying way to resolve the conflict between the First Order and The Resistance. I don't think they are going resolve it. I think that the galaxy will be left in a state of chaos at the end of IX and that will be hook that sets up the next season of movies.

Regardless of how you feel it was handled, I think that JJ Abrams and especially Rian Johnson were asked to write these movies like a tv show, and writing yourself into a corner is a common technique for television shows, as is cycling directors. I'm not necessarily defending either movie's quality. My point is that television shows usually last longer than movie series do, and that I think Disney has decided that writing these movies like a tv show will give them longevity, I think it will. Whether this is true or not I can't say, but, for better or for worse, TLJ felt to me more like an episode of tv than a movie.",StarWars,1546442675,JediKnight67,0,1,True,2019-01-02
2175,"[Spoiler] 1 year after TLJ release, and the loss has set in","Like most of us who are on this subreddit, I'm a huge SW fan. I grew up lovingly watching the original trilogy on VHS, and although I recognize the MANY faults of the prequels, I have re-watched all of them close to a dozen times. TFA came out and I saw it twice in theaters, and about 3 times all the way through since them on blu-ray. I've seen both anthology films, and although Rogue One wasn't my favorite SW movie I've seen I still re-watched it twice and felt it gave something to the SW universe. Solo I thought was a lot of fun, and watched it twice already. 

Moving on to TLJ, I saw it twice opening weekend. After the first viewing I was in complete shock. I did not look forward to the second viewing, and all I wanted to do was get up and leave the theater through the whole thing. The plot was weak, terrible choices were made with Leia, Finn, Poe, and worst of all Luke. With Luke, they killed my hero in a way that made no sense to the characters development. If they were going to kill him off, at least let it be in some blaze of glory showing off some bad ass jedi skills. In the end it was all a joke. I have given it a year to reflect, but sadly nothing about my viewpoint has changed and haven't been able to stomach a 3rd viewing.

Episode IX and SW movies in general moving forward: The magic is GONE. I have zero anticipation for the next movie, and couldn't even tell you when the next movie is supposed to be released.

2185,Over complicated game idea.,"So I've been playing around with an idea for a star wars game for a while. 

Premise:
Game starts around 4 BBY, the Rebellion is still a scattered group of resistance cells largely made up of clone wars veterans and militias.
You're a smuggler or freighter captain from the outer rim. As the game begins you pilot a small freighter (yt series, or any of the more generic ones). Your job is to make deliveries while avoiding imperials and pirates. As the game progresses you're contacted by the Rebellion to help smuggle for them. You're now faced with a choice: grow your smuggling empire and become a crime lord or join the Rebels and rise in their ranks. As you build reputation, rank and wealth you can upgrade your ship, buy new ones and add ships to your fleet. This should be mostly frigate focused ( controlling an mc80 and getting into a 3 hour slog fest with an ISD wouldn't be much fun)  plus you should always feel like you're outnumbered and outgunned. I think the game should end with a battle of slightly smaller  scale than Scariff, with the local Imperial Moff finally catching up to your fleet. 

Gameplay:
Most of the gameplay will be mission driven, but mission failure doesn't mean game over, it means you live with the consequences. So not every single mission is do or die, sometimes you're better off cutting your losses and jumping out of the system. But then you might not get the fuel you needed from that supply depot. Or the intelligence officer the Imperials captured will be tortured and the imperials will know your codes and be able to intercept you more. 

Combat: 
There will be 2 combat modes, tactical and strategic. In tactical you control your flagship in 1st or 3rd person and command your fleet from the front. Think of republic commandos but on a fleet scale, so point at a target and order your Nebulon-b to attack it, or order a wing of Y-wings to take down a specific subsystem. Or point at a location on the map and order your CR90 to establish an anti fighter picket there. In strategic you issue orders to vessels and then tell them to execute them. You can plot out an attack plan in the strategic mode before engaging, and your fleet will follow it, but it might not be the right plan and you could end up saying IT'S A TRAP! My thinking for strategic mode is you're planning the mission before a jump, like the mission briefings in Xwing Alliance. It should be a slow and somewhat clunky system, so you cant both command your ship and use the strategic view to play it as an RTS. So every movement or attack in strategic will prompt a dropdown menu of other options, like increase shield power, switch to ion cannons, launch fighters, jump out of system etc... 

Missions/ events:
Base level missions will be simple pickup/dropoff tasks as a smuggler/freighter. You'll get paid and and can upgrade your ship, but you'll also get infamy and notoriety, which means more Imperial or opposition interest. Each mission will have a random encounter chance, so you're hauling spice to an outer rim black market site, all the sudden a pair of Dreadnaught heavy cruisers drop out of hyperspace, do you bail on the mission, fight it out, out run them, or what? Your gameplay style can be determined by your upgrades and ship choice. As you get a larger fleet together you might find victory classes, or ISDs come in. Or you're trying to jump and an interdictor shows up. 

Crew management:
Because managing 100s of crewmembers in a fleet would be ungainly I'd limit crew management to captains, department chiefs, and wing leaders. Again each of these would have an effect on your fighting ability and hiring better crew members will lead to a better fighting for. I think of it as something like the Silent Hunter series but in Starwars. You'd also be able to promote your crew members, so you have a CR90 captain who kept his ship fighting despite a huge amount of damage? Give them a hammer head. 

Winning/losing:
I'd say winning is less important than surviving. Your goal is to make it to end of the second death star, but you won't be fighting in any major battles like Scarif or Endor. The focus should be on smaller outer rim Skirmishes. So maybe winning will be gathering enough of a fleet to liberate your home system and bring it into the Rebellion? Or turning it into your own personal criminal cartel world like Nar Shadda.
You wouldn't lose the game until your entire fleet and flagship is destroyed. So, you lost 90% of your fleet? Great, go to ground, start again and keep fighting. As the game moves forward you'll get more help from the Rebellion, so you can bide your time until Ackbar and Homeone can come save you, or you could do it yourself and win it sooner, or die trying.

2189,Vader's post-mutilation characterization,"So Shards of the Past got me thinking about this. I've never quite liked the broken man characterization of Vader because it does't seem to square with how he feels in the original trilogy. Yes, yes, not everyone wears their inner turmoil on their black leather sleeves and it's interesting to see an internal characterization that contrasts with what's presented on the surface. But sad, mourning for Padme Vader doesn't really seem like Vader to me. 

I always saw Vader as inhuman. The whole scarred in a fight with Obi-Wan by a volcano was canon even before the prequels. The way I imagined it went down, he was estranged from his wife at this point and Obi-Wan probably lied about her being dead for her protection. 

After the fight, he crippled and maimed but, to Vader's mind, this was liberation. He's severed his attachments. There is no family. There are no friends. There is no more pleasure to be had in his body. It exists now solely to be the seat of his will. It is as if he is a religious ascetic in his mountain hermitage with nothing in his life but absolute focus. The pain is always with him. It reinforces his connection to the Dark Side. 

There's a scene in the second Hellraiser movie. Dr Channard is researching the puzzle box central to the events of the series so he can unlock Hell's secrets. He does and is horrified by what he sees and tries to flee but to no avail. But after going through the gruesome mutilation of becoming a Cenobite he is overwhelmed. ""...And to think I hesitated!"" That's the sort of headspace I think Vader is in. What would appear horrific to him before it happens makes a perfect, terrible sense after he's gone through it. 

Cast in this light, we do not have sad, sulking Vader. We have Vader Triumphant. And this is what makes the discovery he has a son so profound because he never expected to have this sort of feeling again, a human feeling. He said the right things to the Emperor, he kept his true feelings concealed from his master's gaze, even from his own conscious awareness. But by the time of ROTJ, that is when he began to question is path. That is when he said it was too late for him. (Possibly he meant what he said in the climax of Empire about ruling as father and son, perhaps it was a ruse.) And he finally broke with the Emperor when he realized his son was about to die. 

The irony of all this, of course, is attachments are said to be a bad thing but it was attachment to his father that allowed Luke to save him and his father's attachment to his son that allowed him to be saved. According to Obi-Wan and Yoda, this was impossible. 

Anyway, I know this goes against the current canon interpretation but I think it fits the OT a little better. ",StarWars,1546456164,jollyreaper2112,2,1,True,2019-01-02

Some people who drank raw milk have developed severe or even life-threatening diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, and even death.

2200,Reunion with lost love...,"There are a couple of questions coming...

I loved Star Wars, I cannot tell you how many times I saw the first movie, ""A New Hope"" it was later called, at the theater during my summer break as a adolescent back in the 70's.  Growing up and into adulthood I consumed everything Star Wars.  I read just about every EU novel there was and I even loved the Prequels.  

Then George sold it all to Disney and shortly after that Disney killed all the EU material.  Even though I understood the reasoning behind that I was still pissed.  Since then I have seen the two mainline movies and the other two movies Rogue One and Solo which overall I have enjoyed.  I even read a story or two (Lost Stars I think, and the prequel to Rogue One) and enjoyed them.

My question is this... If I was to re-engage the Star Wars universe again is there enough new material (novels, comics, etc) that is generally considered good?  If so, what prerequisites are there (cartoons, I dunno) to fully enjoy them? I say ""new material"" because while I liked Lost Stars, it was basically a retelling of A New Hope from a different angle and did not advance the mythology.

Throughout the Prequel Era we get to see Vader consume Anakin from within little by little until Anakin finally surrenders himself to this aspect of himself. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Walter White and Heisenberg, Darth Vader is simply Anakin Skywalker sans his restraint, morals, and self-control. If we look at pre-suit Vader in particular, he's literally just Anakin having given fully into his flaws. Anakin doesn't become Vader in a day, he slowly lets Vader eat away at him, both through the tragedies he's faced, and, to me, because he enjoys it on some level. Before Anakin truly became Darth Vader and subsequently destroyed his life (much like Walter did upon fully giving into the Heisenberg persona), Anakin seems to get a cathartic release from letting out his rage and anger, the Revenge of the Sith novel even spells it out, Anakin feels *relieved* when Palpatine instructs him to use his rage against Dooku, before Vader consumed him Anakin *liked* letting this part of him take control. 

I feel the idea of Vader consuming Anakin from within is best done in Clone Wars Season 6, when he nearly beats Clovis to death over the latter flirting with his wife, where Anakin so lets go that he shocks even himself and says he doesn't know how or why these things happen to him. 

Sorry for a likely shitty write-up, honestly I just finished marathoning Breaking Bad and liked how Walter's slow transformation reminded me of Vader's. Vader was always inside of Anakin until Anakin couldn't escape him anymore, because Vader was truly the personification of Anakin's worst attributes combined with his pride and lust for power.

2211,Is Rey falling to the dark side?,"When Luke asks Yoda if the dark side is stronger, Yoda replies ""No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.""

In the matter of a couple of days, Rey goes from being amazed when Han confirms that the Force and the Jedi are real to defeating a trained force user in Kylo, using Obi-Wan like Jedi mind tricks, etc. 

The LFL story group explains that she does this because she ""downloads"" training when Kylo enters her mind. Honestly, that seems a little lazy to me. Regardless, wouldn't it make more sense to explain her meteoric rise is due to her taking the quicker, easier and more seductive path in the dark side?

On top of it being a plausible explanation for the rise in her powers, we also see evidence of her drawing on the dark side. When Luke breaks up one of her late night force chats with Kylo, Rey becomes angry and strikes a defenseless Luke in the back of the head. She continues to escalate the attack until she gets an actual lightsaber and points right at Luke while he's on the ground. This is an example of anger and her lashing out IMO. Also, when fighting the palace guards Rey lets out a primal scream. The anger and passion shown here is well known to be used by Sith and dark side users.

2213,My experience with the Star Wars subreddit.,"Quite a long post incoming, but here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fan of Star Wars, and I like to dig into the writing of Star Wars, to discover why I love it so much. Why does the worldbuilding work? Why do characters that we hate (such as Vader for being evil, or initally Ahsoka Tano for being an annoying teenager) are so good? Does this huge Sci-Fi setting follows it's rules? Does it tell consistent, well thought out stories? There have been great and there have been bad stories, but I always found that even the bad had some redeeming qualities, such as the Prequels. But come Disney's movies, and the writing of the new stories are so bad, that the only movie that had ""decent"" writing was Rogue One, because Lucas already wrote it many years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've come to this subreddit to have a chat with you folks under threads regarding the Sequels and the Anthology movies, because this was the first time that I've ever seen something Star Wars be from top to bottom, without a single redeeming quality, horrible. Not even the Prequels were this bad. And I've discovered something horrible. The battle of subjectivity versus objectivity. Now, just to clear it up, I will not take it away anyone that they liked a movie. In fact, I fucking love TLJ, because of it's absolutely horrible writing ended up being really educational for a lot of people. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when I got into debates with some people, when I tried to present facts about why the new movies are bad (such as the worldbuilding of the Sequels: Episode 7 not binding the OT and itself together, or Episode 8 not binding itself and 7 together), I was constantly met with these replies: ""Film is subjective"", ""That is just your opinion"", ""The movies are good, what are you talking about"" and many like this, without people ever trying to argue why the new movies are actually great. I also found that people use their own head-canon to invent the plot in order to ""defend"" it.

&amp;#x200B;

These people are saying that everything is subjective, and nothing is objective, but they do not stay consistent to their own rules, because when I try to argue that the new movies are bad, I insantly get downvote-bombed and be called an idiot. If it's subjective, why are you telling me I'm wrong? For these people, not liking the movies is like commiting a sin against God. And when I counter their every point, they either don't reply at all, or just tell me to shut up. When you like something this much, you shouldn't have a problem defending it with actual facts. How am I wrong? Present me with the information I missed or misinterpreted, and I will accept it and evolve from it. I will link some of my discussions with a few people, just so you guys can see what I went through.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to clear this up: Film is NOT subjective, WHEN it comes to writing. It is entirely subjective to decide on whether you liked the movie or not, because liking or not liking something is ultimately an emotion, a qualifier. But when someone says that ""TLJ doesn't have any flaws"" is ultimately objective, because it lacks any emotive language. Even if you add ""in my opinion"" to this sentence, it is still very much objective, because it is a statement of fact. But writing does have objective quality. Imagine this: if we didn't have the title crawl of the original Star Wars, seeing the Empire trying to take down Leia and to return the DS plans would be incredibly jarring. We don't know what the two factions are. We don't know why they are enemies. We don't know which side to root for. We don't know why the DS plans are important for both sides. We don't know the goals of each faction. There are many questions that can be answered if we didn't have the title crawl, and ultimately, our immersion, and the quality of the story takes a great hit.

&amp;#x200B;

This example basically happened with Episode 7 and 8. Episode 7 deleted all the achievements earned by the end of Episode 6, and did a complete reset. That comes with many questions: How and why did Luke vanish? What's up with the Jedi Order? Why is he the last jedi? Why is he the only one who can stop TFO? Why exactly in his absence could TFO rise? Why didn't the New Republic and The Resistance try to stop them? Why is the Resistance a more powerful force than the Republic? What is the Republic? Why is the Resistance needed as a separate faction? And there are even more questions answered as we move forward with the movie, and only a few of them are answered. I will also provide a link to some of these questions at the end of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I'm so confused about is that people just buy this shit, and accept it without any question. u/Shakespearean_Rumba has to be one of the most ignorant fans on the Disney movies. Anything that remotely criticizes TLJ he considers an infidel. But when I present him facts, he does the same thing like most other people on this subreddit: he doesn't reply, or just tells me that I'm wrong without presenting anything that would remotely support his statement. Or he uses the safety-chord: say that it's just all opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I've certainly fallen into the trap of being a blind fanboy before with other stories that I absolutely adored. When I realized that I was actually wrong, that's when I decided to rip into stories this much. To discover why I love certain stories, and to discover why I didn't like certain movies. Because writing has meaning. Writing is educational. Well-written stories takes us out of our world, and renews our souls. But the state of this subreddit is like fighting a pointless war against ignorance. When you are constantly told that you are wrong without any arguments to support the opposing side's statements, when your nice comments get disliked just because people either know you don't like the movies or just mentions it, and when you counter every single argument, people either don't respond or tell me to stay silent. This subreddit is horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I will still continue to comment on this subreddit, because, at this point, it's just funny how ignorant and blind people can be to what makes something a quality product. Because right now Star Wars is objectively bad. But I don't want it to be that way. Because I love Star Wars. But, there are a few people that I could at least have a few laughs.

2215,Some Ideas I had for The Sequel Trilogy that I wanted to share.,"I didn't know what to name this post but from day one I had ideas about things that could happen. This isn't about bashing The Last Jedi (I am disappointed by it) but where I thought the story would go and by now discussing what could have been.
Its a rather weird post but I wanted to know what people would think if this had been the case?
The main thing I wanted to share originally was my idea that the characters force affiliation would be mixed up to surprise the audience with TLJ. Luke would try to train Rey but ultimately out of fear rejecting her, as she leaves however he gets in contact with Anakin and together they reflect upon everything, Luke lets himself for the first time accept what happened. He therefore seeks out Ben through the force. (Luke and Snoke are on the same level of Force Power, the reason Snoke won was by sowing discord/manipulating both Luke and Kylo, it would not have worked again. I am also not fully sure but I would have given him more of a true backstory, maybe being an overarching villain or a shard of Palpatine reborn.) 
At the same time Rey is leaving with Chewie, she is furious, filled with anger and a desire for revenge towards Ben for the death of Han. Unlike what is shown they sorta developed a father/daughter relationship, she never having had a family loathes Kylo's choice. She senses a presense (Snoke)

So basically TLJ would be about Ben with the aide of Luke and Anakin would be forgiven and return to the light side, always dreaming of being a Jedi but turned away when Luke betrayed him. Rey would similarily be pulled to the dark side by Snoke, Luke would serve as a loving Uncle to Ben whilst Rey would not have anyone to pull her back. Rey would also be related to Obi Wan aka Rey Kenobi would prove true.

I imagine that Rey would become the new head of the Knights of Ren, taking on some new name (in my mind Tzun Ren) but idk and Ben Solo would return as a Jedi Knight, he would teach Finn the ways of the force and resume training under Luke (when Luke tries to reach Rey it is too late. Rey is also more force powerful than Ben, almost to Lukes level but untrained.)

Ben would remake his lightsaber, making it purple like Mace's to indicate that he has both sides, he would retain the side parts but instead making them stable. Finn would use a blue lightsaber aka the standard. Rey would finally use a double lightsaber like Maul (I want this to be true based on the staff she carries). Both sides either Red or Red and another color.

On the Galactic front, The First Order has been pushing the Republic back but they aren't wiped out. Leia returns to take command of what remains of the Republics fleets and does everything in her power to repel the invasion. Gradually the fight equalizes as organization is restored and large parts of the Republic remain intact even if the chain of command and political power is shattered. 

Similarily I would have made the First Order appear more like as if they were in a Cold war with the Republic than being a fledgling group of Imperial diehard wannabes. The real advantage they had would have been in first strike advantage and surprise.. which gradually turns against them.

2216,Episode 9 plot thoughts,"Right am going to make this short but this is a episode 9 speculation thread. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it has been said that JJ is going to tie everything together with this last movie its also been reported that there will probably be some kind of jump in time. I have been trying to think about what the movie could be about so this is what I think could be interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the movie could be about the survivors of Crait being on the run, they are the last threat to the First Order and Ray is believed to the ""The Last Jedi"". Kylo is now head of the First Order and is expanding the Knights of ren as his personal enforces snapping up force sensitives to train them in the dark side, and hunting down Ray. I think Lia's going to have a very small screen in the movie where she tells Ray about another group of ex-jedi in the unknown regions who are separate from Lukes Jedi academy (or whatever he had going on) and that if they find this group then they can challenge the knights of Ren and possibly that Lando knows where they are and is the only one that can take her to them (Leia dies early on after this)

&amp;#x200B;

So our hero's meet up with Lando and the First order find out that he could be leading the resistance to a unknown group of Jedi in the unknown regions. I think of this then as being a cat and mouse game where our hero's are on the run from the first order while trying to desperately hunt for this group of Jedi who can help them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway we get to the final act of the movie and Lando leads them to this group. This is the big bit, ties it all together, the group consists of Ashoka, Ezra, Sabine (possibly having had a force sensitive kid), Kana's kid, I am also thinking the Mandalorian could be in this group. Luke appears to everyone in a force vision and says its now or never because Snoke told Kylo some big ass secret that could destroy the very fabric of the force. So we end with the most epic Star Wars fight ever a group of heroes from across the universe getting into a massive fight with Kylo and his knights of Ren. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could be way off (probably am) but I just think that the last episode needs to do something different and this could work. ",StarWars,1546480569,3421431boom,10,1,True,2019-01-02

2218,A one year time skip won’t be enough to fix Rey.,"I said this before to my friends and others on the internet. That the Laat Jedi, imo, truly fucked up was making it happen like hours after Force Awakens.

I don’t know who decided on this, I don’t know how this was allowed. But did no one ask, “Hey can Ray learn to fight, use the force, and a light saber in less then three days?”

The answer is no. She couldn’t, and she didn’t learn shit from Luke.

Which is why she struggle vs those Guards. But you know, plot, makes her win. Makes her “be able to kill” easy, makes her be able to fight easily. I seen/read enough anime/manga to understand a plot device or MC shonen Power ups.

Which is why you feel like most of the movie was the most pointless waste of time(and cause of script). Ray literally got one thing from her time with Luke. And it was just three books that will teach her the ways. Even tho Luke was suppose to teach her the ways. 

Now the next Movie will be making around the same mistake!

How can Ray learn everything in one year? 

In the old movies each movie has a time skip between movies. First movie Luke is a noob, Second still kinda noob but he got use to his status/power, third movie he has pretty much full control, and is now breaking his ceiling.

Same thing with Anakin in the prequels. Each movie had a time skip, each movie Anakin was at a different level.

So let’s see what is Reys track?

Ok magically swings a lightsaber and beats a dude that has been training as a kid. This same Kid was powerful enough to deal with Luke as a young teen. Yet got beat by someone who just got the force? 

NANI!?

Then in the second movie, she didn’t learn shit. Absolutely fucking nothing from Luke. The books will take Lukes place in teaching Rey.

Now I have to watch a new Starwars movie knowing that Rey doing w.e she does will just be bullshit plot. One year to learn from three books? Then what, she’s At Lukes level? Remember she has to be stronger then Ren. Who was able to fight back against Luke as a teen. Who is now a full adult, fights better then her( go watch the Guard vs them scene), and should be as strong of a force user as her.

At the end of the day, the first movie, I can forgive her plot device(cause Ren was wounded).

But the Last Jedi literally fucked Rey as a character for me. Any growth outside of like hardcore training for 2-3years, is going to be a bullshit from me dog.

Like come on, she struggled to pick up fucking Rocks. Really? Mean while Ren is over here blowing away buildings and making shit collapse, again as a Teen.

The last Jedi fucked this entire thing for me, by not time skipping to a point where Luke has already been training Rey for over 5-7months. Then we see the fall out between both of them because Luke refuses to teach her how to fully embrace the force(Accepting Darkness also)That’s what should have been done.

- Count Dooku: Dooku was his master’s master, and Dooku obviously respected Obi-Wan a lot. He divulged the greatest secret Sith plan to Obi-Wan alone on Geonosis.

- General Grievous: These two were arch-nemeses during the Clone Wars. Their rivalry was perhaps the most well known throughout the whole conflict. They’re nice combative foils.

- Asajj Ventress: They fought quite a lot, and also had a funny and sometimes flirty relationship with one another. They ended up working together against Maul and Savage too.

- Palpatine/Sidious/The Senate: The Chancellor of the Republic Obi-Wan swore to uphold, the one who corrupted Anakin, the man that all but destroyed the Jedi Order and liberty throughout the galaxy. This dude smiled and shook hands with Obi-Wan for years before killing everyone, including Anakin (from a certain point of view).

- Darth Vader: His best friend, his brother, his son, all three wrapped in one. He turned on his friends, on his family, on his life. He murdered younglings and hated everyone, after years of closeness and the Star Wars version of the Dynamic Duo since they were both so young.

     I apologize off the bat, I’m writing this on my mobile. 

     To me the best thing about Star Wars it the lore behind it, Lucas managed to create an entire living and growing universe. This lead me to wonder where to start to get the best experience out of this amazing universe? I decided with Rebels because after my first time through the series I thought the portrayal of the characters was perfect, I was sucked into every second it was on. 
   
     With that it also gave a good impression of the Empire and the conflict between good and evil that the Original Trilogy so poetically displays. You get a sense of the struggles people endured under the fear of the Empire, which for significance to the Skywalker saga displays how far Anakin had fallen to the darkness. Which is true... if you look at it from a certain point of view. Even more the lore it added to the force was amazing, Ezras training is a good comparisons with Luke in my opinion. It gives a depth of the difficulty of Lukes training that I’d always missed as a kid. Rebels sets up a good base lore, and introduces us to my personal favourite character Obi Wan. For however short he appeared it strengthens his importance to the OT. 

      Next was Solo it was the next on the timeline so I thought it made sense. I’m just gunna say that I really enjoyed Solo, what I’m not really a fan of is all the hate going around the fandom. For real guys they may not be perfect but if I get to see lightsabers I’m pretty much happy. Enough of that on to the next one, Rouge One another obvious choice considering the timeline. 

     From here it’s pretty straight forward, I was raised right and I saw the OT first, then the prequels came out when I was still a kid. Seeing RotS in theatres blew my mind and solidified my love for Star Wars. After seeing on here one day a post about the machete order I did it and loved the idea of using the PT (and Clone Wars, which I could go on forever about as well) as a flashback to the big reveal of “No I am your father” ohh gives me chills just thinking about it. 

     From there it’s a straight shot to the finish, although I haven’t watched Resistance yet but I’m considering throwing it in there. I feel obligated to say this as well about the Last Jedi, personally I saw it three times in theatres within two weeks and each time I enjoyed it more than the last. After time I’ve noticed flaws but overall it is a really good movie and in my opinion it doesn’t necessarily go against Lukes character to cast himself out. I’m just saying it wasn’t the first time we’ve seen a Jedi Master go into exile. I am so excited to see where Abrams will go with Episode IX, and I look forward to the discussions around it after!

But ya know, I see a small community of self indulgent, nit picky, smug, pricks acting like reddit is the center of the Star Wars fanbase and like you are all experts at making movies. I personally agree to disagree with anybody and never get angry when disagreeing with somebodies opinion. But the fact that this community on reddit is so up their own ass and thought the Vader film wasnt that good is insane. Not only was the short film amazing, but theres 4 million people+ who think the same thing. I read comments(the majority) on here expressing some seriously toxic shit, saying the dialogue was trash, writing paragraphs and paragraphs about how every thing in the film sucked while praising TLJ, Disney, and the shitty half assed 3 star films they have been putting out. So to anybody whos foot fits in this shoe, go fuck yourself lol. Fuck this small ass community, and fuck your rules and opinions. It reeks of farts all over reddit, ya bunch of san fransisco prius driving pussies. Not sure if this post broke any rules, but I honestly couldn't give a fuck about ever coming back here with your 1000 member community.

There's obvious friction between Poe and Holdo throughout a lot of The Last Jedi but I think this is Poe somewhat hazily trying to pay homage to a fallen comrade who he was disillusioned with but ultimately grew to respect and admire. There's the more overt part of his arc where he pulls the speeders away and becomes a true leader but this seems a more nuanced moment that likely went over a lot of people's heads.

2269,[Spoilers: Rebels] Struggling to grasp the meta-Force concepts in TCW and Rebels,"I just finished Rebels, and am feeling like I either don't get the ideas that these episodes are talking about, or I'm just frustrated with their vagueness. I'm primarily talking about the Mortis connection, but this also extends to the TCW episodes about the Wellspring of Life, as well as the Bendu and the World Between Worlds episodes of Rebels.

With respect to the Mortis arc in TCW, I didn't find glean any useful or meaningful information for the following:

- Are the Father, Son and Daughter real entities that exist (in this dimension or another), or are they just visions in a 'dream sequence' shared by Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka?
- If the Son needs a ship to escape Mortis and wreck the galaxy, then why does he need to be controlled at all, by the Father or Anakin? Do the actions of the Father, Daughter and Son within Morts affect the galaxy at large, even though they don't really exist in the same dimension?
- I don't recall the exact quote, but the Father says that ""too much of [the Son] or [the Daughter] would be a disaster for the universe."" I found this confusing as well. The Son obviously wants to destroy things, but what about the Daughter? We're just told that too much of the Daughter (light side of the Force) is dangerous, but we're just supposed to accept it as truth and ignore the question ""How could too much selflessness possibly destroy the galaxy?"" I found that this quote reinforced my dislike of the concept of ""Balance,"" which is only ever mentioned in the context of keeping the dark side at bay. The word balance implies that the good needs to be balanced out by darkness as well, otherwise it wouldn't be called *Balance*, it would be *Never do evil things ever, be as good as possible all the time*, which seems to be what the Jedi want anyway.

I didn't have too many plot-specific issues with *World Between Worlds*, but are we meant to interpret that all Jedi and Sith temples have gateways into the fabric of reality? This seems like a really important idea that had a lot of lead-up with the Lothwolves, but didn't really amount to [anything](/s ""other than Ahsoka being rescued through time. That's fine, Ahsoka is a great character, but it's the end of a series that is the end chronologically of anything that she's been in to date, which makes it pointless unless she appears in Episode IX or *Resistance*"").

If anyone can clarify any of this, that would be super helpful; right now I'm mildly frustrated with these sorts of episodes. ",StarWars,1546534543,TheMcCleaver,11,1,True,2019-01-03

2271,A TLJ alternate to have a real-space chase scene with the First Oder and the Raddus,"I was thinking how we could have gotten a sensible real-space chase with the First Order fleet and the Raddus.    Bear with me please.  First, we would need to negate micro-jumps to get ahead of the Raddus.  We need a way to negate the numerical superiority of the First Order and their TIES.   Finally, we need a way to get rid of the First Order Fleet and the Supremacy and allow the Raddus to be lost in a heroic sacrifice.  All of that would allow the movie to continue along and maintain continuity.  This is what I came up with.  A TIE scout tracks the Resistance strike force back from Star Killer Base to the Resistance Base.   The Resistance knows they have to move and call in the Raddus and the Ninka and some other ships to evacuate.  The Resistance jumps in with a small fleet including the Dreadnought, an interdictor and a some Star Destroyers.  Both fleets launch their fighter screens but the First Order holds their back close as they are prepping the big guns on the Dreadnought.   The Dreadnought fires on the Raddus, and it takes a hell of a hit but the experimental shields take most of it and the ship takes minor damage  The Poe and the bombers take a run at the  Interdictor and disable it causing it to glancingly collide with the Dreadnought.  It doesn't destroy it but it takes the shields down and the Raddus and the Ninka hammer it and destroy it.  Then the Resistance ships  recover their fighters and all jump away on different vectors.   The First Order follows the Raddus.  The follow the usual protocol to jump away a few times on random vectors but the First Order hounds them with more and more ships joining, including the Supremecy. On the last jump, they barely escape another interdictor.  Leia then has them jump to Graveyard, the remains of Alderan.   The Alderan system is a mess with asteroids and disrupted planetary orbits and no one in their right mind goes there.  One has to stay in real-space in most of the system.  The First Order can't micro-jump anywhere useful to cut them off.  It turns into a real-space chase with Resistance and First Order fighters all over the place and the Raddus filling the space behind it with point-defense fire. They seem like they are at a dead end though.  The Resistance fighters screen is holding through skill and desperation, but the First Order is wearing them down with numbers.  The Raddus is nominally faster and more maneuverable than the larger First Order ships, but the asteroid field is wild and not kind to any of the ships.  Leia and Holdo come up with a plan.  They have been slowly slipping transports away during the chase. The Raddus is on a skeleton crew.  Kylo Ren breaks through the fighter screen and does his thing and Leia gets hurt and Holdo takes command.  From recon flights, Finn's knowledge and such, they have theorized that the Supremacy is maintaining a hyperspace bubble as part of their hyperspace tracking computer system.  This leaves them vulnerable to something unheard of, light speed ramming.   They rig the ship to be flight controlled from a single station and Holdo orders everyone else off.   She turns on the Supremacy and preps to jump to hyperspace.  The Raddus accelerates to relativistic speeds and the hyperspace fields of the two ship interact and cancel and the Raddus slams into the Supremacy at nearly the speed of light doing massive damage  just like in the movie.    Rey and Kylo and Snoke can still do their thing in the interim.  What about Luke and Kylo and the need for a heroic sacrifice?  Dude, I can't solve all your problems.

2280,Different Power Levels in Star Wars Media,"Now I love everything Star Wars from the movies (yes even the ones made by Disney) to books, and many more. So here's a thought. A character or group will have different power levels in different media.  One of the best examples is General Grievous. In different shows he's able to do different things. In one instance is powerful enough where he can take on three Jedi masters (Two I might add were from the Jedi Council), two Jedi Knights (One being well known and very strong one at that), and one Padawan all at once. He took on all of them on his own and handily defeated each and every single one of them. The only reason they survived is that ARC clones came and got their butts out of there. Even then they only manage to save half of them. Now while in another media he's more of a coward who gets beaten more than once and runs way often. Several times he's needed the help of droids to level the playing field against Jedi. Most of the time he wins when he faces Jedi other than Obi-Wan yes, but he never wins as an unstoppable warrior, he wins by using tricks and cheap tactics. He is only one case of this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Jedi in general have conflicting power levels. In some medias they're able to take on armies on their own then there are versions where they desperately need the clones to stand a chance.  The droids are sometimes seen as easily disposable canon fodder or they're seen as a formidable army.  In fact to me, this is one of the reasons why people didn't like The Last Jedi. They were used to a character being a certain level, so when the made them less powerful they got angry. It's not really anyone's fault in particular it's kinda all our fault. Everyone sees a group/character at a certain level and they might have a different view to someone else. So that leads to different creators putting different things at different levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

2282,Why I think the stormtroopers can’t aim,"As we all know, stormtroopers seem to have TERRIBLE aim. The main reason they can’t hit their targets is because if they hit their targets, our beloved main characters wouldn’t be alive, thus would conclude Star Wars.
    However on a rewatch of a New Hope, I noticed in the main scene that all of the rebels on the Tantive IV were gunned down by the rebels in the opening scene. Later on in the same opening sequence, a group of stormtroopers stumble across Princess Leia hiding. She gets a couple shots off and kills one stormtrooper. Only one of the stormtroopers takes a shot with their stun gun, and he hits her immediately.
    So what happens? From A New Hope on, the stormtroopers have terrible aim. I think this is because all of the good aim stormtroopers died when the Death Star blows up. Hear me out 
    Stormtroopers are not clones. They have to be trained, refined, the best of the best. But they have human error unlike the clones. They have personality. 
    Since we can assume that stormtroopers graduate from the academy in classes (class of 2020, etc) then that means that different classes have different skill levels. Only the most skilled stormtroopers are used. And only the best stormtroopers would be on the Death Star to protect Lord Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin.
    So when the Death Star blew up, so did all the best stormtroopers. This might be an explanation for their inconsistent aim, they’re the reserve stormtroopers.
    Again this is just a speculation. I’m sure there is a reason somewhere in the comics, but this is my take, thanks!

2283,I just completed watching Original Trilogy and Prequel Trilogy for the first time,"What I love about these movies is, nobody's too powerful like superheroes. Everybody has reasonable power and they aren't crazy, including master Yoda. Even though he is respected so much in the Jadis, he isn't crazy powerful. At first, I was disappointed by this but then I accepted it. This is one of the reason why I loved this series so far.

In Prequel Trilogy, I think they should have showed Anakin less obvious as Darth Vader, at least in the beginning of the trilogy.

In the beginning this young kid starts off as a great young one and in the very next episode he is a complete asshole. The transition should have been a little smoother, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people in my life have pointed out many times that the Star Wars movies aren't exactly the greatest of all time. They then also point out that most people are on the band wagon and are liking it just because that is what is  popular right now. This made me really think what makes SW such a big deal to me. It's not because the movies are the most creative and revolutionary, well written or even visually pleasing, but Its Because Star Wars is so much of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

In elementary (I am in my early 20's now for reference), I had a hard time trying to fit in with the other kids. I constantly struggled to interact and I didn't know how to make friends. That's when my parents got me a specific Lego set, just because it was on sale (set #7655) which was also weird because I never had Lego's before. I had no idea what Star wars was at the time.  I took one of the mini figures to school one day out of hope that it would peak someones interest. And it did! I distinctly remember the other boys in my class all gathering around me in the morning  and they began to talk about the Lego Star wars sets they had and the movies.  One of them then invited me over to his house to play Star Wars battlefront after school. The rest is history, These guys became my close friends and for a majority of our child hood everything we did would be star wars related. Those are some of my best memories. And if it wasn't for Star Wars, I don't think that I would have any friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, When the love of my life and  I first started dating, we almost exclusively talked about star wars because that was one of the few things that we knew the other liked. We would spend our weekend nights sitting on opposite sides of the couch watching the original trilogy. We got super excited when we watched the trailer for  The Force Awakens. Even more when we went to go see it in theaters. Star Wars is one of the basic things in the foundation for our relationship. The person I am, the things I have, and the memories I cherish are all thanks to Star Wars.

So when people point out that Star wars may have a basic plot, and may have a slow pace with lame action sequences, I tell them that those parts are what made me feel like I am wanted by others.

2290,The Last Jedi completely ruined and destroyed what made the original 6 films amazing.,"I am drunk but I am a frequent poster on this subreddit so fuck it.

The Last Jedi ruined everything that the original 6 films of the stood for.

Luke Skywalker's entire character arc was to grow beyond the mistakes of the old Jedi. It is common for people to say ""Rey will grow past the mistakes of the old Jedi"" as though that is her character arc. But Luke never took her as his student and the only things he taught her were that the Jedi were terrible.

Rey's sole purpose in the larger 9-film Saga is to take over the role that Luke would have had. It is common for people to say that she will ""learn from the mistakes of the old Jedi"" [example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/a1z93y/luke_skywalker_did_not_train_rey_as_his_student/eau2m6y/). This was Luke's purpose in the Saga. Obi-Wan and Yoda told Luke that he had to kill Vader. Obi-Wan even said that ""the Emperor has already won"" when Luke said that he could not kill his own father. Luke took what the old Jedi forbade, attachments, and used them to defeat the Emperor. ""Father, please!"" Luke used his relation to his father to ask for his help, and he succeeded. Vader, through his attachment to his son, defeated the Emperor, bringing balance to the Force. Obi-Wan failed to turn Vader. Yoda failed to defeat the Emperor. Yet Luke was the one to accomplish these feats because he did what they never could. In fact, if you Google ""New Jedi Order"", the Wookiepedia article that comes up is Legends, because the new canon considers Luke's Jedi Order to be a part of the Old Jedi Order. Luke's role is further negated in The Last Jedi because Rian Johnson decided to make Luke a murderous failure who *repeated* the mistakes of the old Jedi.

Luke was meant to be the man who evolved beyond what the old Jedi stood for. He embraced familial attachments, and in the end, it is what allowed him to be the catalyst that caused Vader to destroy the Emperor. Yet he upon seeing a Force vision he went agains everything he stood for in the entire Saga and thought that the best course of action was to kill his nephew. This is a complete bastardization of his character and a betrayal of what he stood for in the Original Trilogy. This is why The Last Jedi is the worst film in the entire series. 

Now people have moved on to Rey, saying that she will rebuild the Jedi Order, but that is ridiculous when you actually think about what she has actually learned. Luke's arc in TLJ saw him representing the failures of the old Jedi. He never trained Rey, giving her two lessons, one about breathing, and one about how the Jedi sucked. Rey stole the books of the old Jedi. This is in direct conflict of what TLJ is saying. So the only way Rey will become a proper Jedi is through studying the books, though these are the books of the old Jedi which we know have failed, meaning Rey will also eventually fall into the same trap and fail (probably shown in Episode X in 20 years when Disney needs some more money). Rey will never move beyond and learn from the mistakes of the old Jedi because the only way she will learn to become the Jedi is through the texts of the institution she is supposed to grow beyond.

In short, Rey's entire purpose is to usurp what Luke should have done. Disney wanted to do a soft reboot of the Saga without admitting it, and in doing so has destroyed what the original 6-film Saga was about. What was originally a story about a son growing beyond the mistakes of his father and restoring the Jedi Order that his father destroyed has become a story about a random nobody swooping in and taking over everything that the series originally stood for.

And yet people continue to wonder why people hate the new movies. There is a reason that The Last Jedi underperformed by hundreds of millions and Solo became one of the biggest bombs of all time (both of these statements are facts it is undeniable I have seen many people say that Solo broke even this is a lie if you say this you are being willfully stupid). It is because a lot of people realized that Rian Johnson fundamentally misunderstands Star Wars, and Lucasfilm stood by his decisions. If Lucasfilm refuses to move past Rian Johnson's vision for Star Wars, films will continue to underperform.

2292,Star Wars: How the Saga should have begun,"There are still several things that bother me about how the prequels got the backstory of the original trilogy wrong. So here is a list of corrections (additions are welcome).

&amp;#x200B;

C-3PO: The thing that always bugged me the most about the prequels is that C-3PO was build by a slave boy on a desert planet. C-3PO is protocol droid, is made of gold, serves no practical purposes, has an excessively mannered and stilted way of speaking and behaving. It’s virtually the last thing a poor slave boy would build or what you would need on a desert planet. It would have been so easily possible to place C-3PO into the entourage of princess Padme, getting some comic relief out of the fact that he obviously appears out of place outside of the royal court. His purpose could be, as in the original serious, to school an increasingly rebellious princess that is about to grow up quickly due to the dramatic events that accompany the raise of the Empire.

&amp;#x200B;

THE DISFIGUREMENTS OF VADER AND OF THE EMPEROR: In the official prequels, the disfigurements of Vader and the Emperor are unrelated, because one gets hit by his own Force Energy in a fight and the other one falls into Lava. These are just accidents that could happen to anybody and are unrelated to their path to the dark side. What if turning to the dark side implies both a mental and a bodily transformation, just like when evil elves turn into orcs in LOTR. So the complete surrender to the dark side is the price you have to pay for absolute power. My suggestion is that there is a light saber with pure dark energy that gives his owner absolute power. But only the strongest Jedi can wield that sword, and even then it takes a heavy toll on their body and mind. These are powerful weapons from the Dark Times that are hidden away. To retrieve them, Vader has to fight Jedi Knights that have protected them for centuries because their use is forbidden. Using the sword in the final fight to save Padme hurts Vader to the degree that he has to wear a mask to survive. But it also unleashes the dark force in him.

&amp;#x200B;

THE PATH TO THE DARK SIDE: Why should Vader turn to the dark side? In the prequels, there are several unrelated random events that turn him to the dark side, such as Palpatine being already evil, his mother getting killed by sand people, his hate of sand, and his self-imposed celibacy. What if his turn to absolute power is a sacrifice he thinks he has to make for saving the galaxy and Padme? So the idea is that there is a serious threat to the galaxy and to Padme, and everything seems lost until Vader reaches for the dark side. Given that the Empire represents ORDER, it seems logical that the new, evil force (that is already defeated in the original trilogy) represents CHAOS. Vader sees only one way to stop this evil force and to save his loved ones, by reaching for absolute power, turning to the dark side, and helping the Emperor to establish a fascist state. But maybe this was all an evil plot of the Emperor all along who betrayed Vader and was the source of the chaotic force all along (he has created CHAOS in a plot to gain power). Tragically, Vader never learns the truth about this, and serves the Emperor, thinking this is necessary to preserve the order of the galaxy even though he serves Evil without knowing. 

&amp;#x200B;

THE JEDI ORDER: Rather than being politicians, the JEDI are a group of religious hippies preaching love and peace and protecting the power of the force from being misused for evil purposes as in the Dark Times. Their most sacred principle is that the force must not be misused for political purposes it must only be used for healing and protection. However, in the face of a potential annihilation of the galaxy by CHAOS, they finally are reluctantly convinced by a council of rulers (including Padme) to join the forces and to side with the empire in the war (there is no Senate).

&amp;#x200B;

THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION OF VADER: Rather than being born by a mother, Vader is created in a religious ritual by the Jedi Order as an absolute weapon for the Empire. This is the original SIN of the Jedi Order who use the dark force to create Vader which is forbidden. Vader is not seen as a human being, and is raised and trained as a weapon by the Jedi in the war against CHAOS. Only Padme sees Vader as a human being and falls in love with him. Maybe she is also just a tiny little bit attracted to his power and impressed by his control of the force but this is only implied and certainly not the reason for her love that is driven by empathy for the poor boy who never experienced love.

&amp;#x200B;

THE STORMTROOPERS: The Empire’s troops are created by the Emperor with the use of the dark force. The most healthy sons of the Empire are presented to him. He hovers his hands over their temples, injecting them with dark energy, and creating helpful idiots that follow the Empire no matter what. This accidentally causes some brain damage, causing them to aim like they do in the original trilogy.

&amp;#x200B;

THE TWINS: Padme immediately realizes her mistake after Vader’s turn to the dark side (she rather would have rather died than seeing him losing his human side). She quickly joins the growing resistance against the rising Empire, but she is already pregnant (there is no celibacy). She hides and gives birth to the children because she thinks that Vader will want their children to grow up in the Empire and to follow his example. The Emperor pushes Vader to find his son, knowing that he likely can be used as weapons as well, assuming that he has inherited some of Vader’s powers. Vader sends his henchmen, and Padme is killed protecting her children. In a most traumatic moment in which Leia’s life is seriously threatened, Luke kills all of the the henchmen at once in a gigantic power burst and loses consciousness. He later is completely amnestic about this. The Jedi (who have immediately formed the resistance after the Emperor’s power grab and Vader’s turn to the dark side) are very worried about this, as Luke is an obvious danger to the galaxy if he is found by his father and used as a weapon by the Emperor. Therefore, the children are separated. Leia is adopted by her aunt and uncle, who raise her as their own daughter so that she grows up as a princess while Luke is hidden away on the most distant and abandoned planet by Obi van Kenobi. There he is supposed to live the most boring life to avoid triggering the dark powers that are in him.",StarWars,1543746131,Croclodyte,0,1,True,2018-12-02

2303,Why the system of government of the Empire is superior to that of the Galactic Republic.,"What defines a state? Well, many things, but according to Max Weber, it is the [""monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence) meaning that in a state, only government is allowed to legally **use force to enforce its will**. By this definition, Medieval France, for example, was not a state, because the law was enforced by many feudal lords, and this power was distributed between many counts, dukes, and other lords alike. States became to form in 16th-17th centuries, in the Tudor period of England, for example. 

Now, with that squared away, lets turn to Star Wars. What is Galctic Republic? Well, it is a union of **sovereign** star systems that [govern](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic) the galaxy. And this union, being a very **loose Federation** of Star systems has a very limited reach as a government. As a clear example of this we can observe the Siege of Naboo in 32 BBY. Why did the siege start in the first place? The Galactic Republic Senate passed the [Prop 31-814D](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prop_31-814D), which practically made **Free trade zones**, the zones of the galaxy where the trade was untaxed, which were used by the Tade Federation for shady businesses and **tax evasion**, taxable again. In response The Trade Federation imposed a blockade of Naboo, wanting to force an agreement that would grant trade priviliges to them in this sector. 

Although this action was unconstitutional, Galactic Republic practically lacked any executive branch, effectively leaving execution of laws to the governments of systems which comprise the Galactic Republic. **This made control on levels higher than that of the planet impossible, indirectly giving immence power to companies and corporations who remained unchecked by government of the Republic**. Shure, there were Republican [Judicial Forces](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Judicial_Forces#cite_note-A.26O_I-4), a remnant of the Republic Military, but they acted only on the ***consent of the Senate***, which was very hard to obtain. In the later years, the Senate more often turned to the **Jedi** to settle different issues, which was of cource very dangerous, scince the Jedi Order in itself is a small government, with personal interests, and responding to no one but to the Senate, which was more than happy to use them in their interests.

 So, **on paper**, the Republic had the Legislative (Senate), executive ([Office of the Chancellor](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Office_of_the_Chancellor)) and judicial (Supreme court + Judicial Department) branches of government, but **in reality** executive branch could only send envoys and was wholly dependent on the Senate, **lacking any power to act**. And the judicial branch was corrupt and a **bureaucratic slog**, **Supreme Court** not being able to rule out a conviction, for example, for Nute Gunray, after he imposed a blockade on Naboo. In this situation, where corporations have more real power than the Galactic government, and where a galactic law is enforced by both The Jedi and the Judicial department, which, as I said wholly depend on the Senate, the Senate is the only branch of government of the Republic, that has any real power.

So, lets Dissect the Senate. The Senators who comprised the Senate **were selected by governments** of systems that comprised the Republic. **Senators did not have any power back home**, as that power was in hands of whatever Institution was in power of the government of that system. A king, a president, a prime minister, a governor, it does not matter. What matters is that there was **no real control by the Republic of what happened in theese systems**. Senators in theory were supposed to be monitored by the Court and the Chancellor, but the court had **no means of prosecuting Senators** for their crimes, and Chancellor had **no power to resist the Senate** (for example not signing in a legislation the Senate has voted in). In such situation corporations like Trade Federation and Techno Union striked up deals with Senators to promote their own Interests. If a corporation exceeded its legal actions, a discussion of this was buried in the constant sessions of the senate which were most often concluded in nothing.

By 24 BBY a group of senators dissatisfied with this announced a secessionist movement, which lead to the Clone Wars. However, having no real power they were **forced to strike up deals** with very reasons the Republic faced its downfall - Techno Union and other corporations who **were promised further support** and ease of regulations by Dooku.

As you all know, Chancellor Palpatine during the war accumulated power and announced the **Creation of Empire** with a centralised government. Now, the most Important action Emperor Palpatine made, was to establish the institution of **Moffs**, establishing both planetary as well as regional governors throughout the Galaxy. Theese governors had **direct authority** over **Sector or Planet** they were in charge of. If you want an **analogy - this is almost a copy of the Roman Republic/Empire** with it's provinces and governors. Moffs **answered directly** to the  **Imperial Ruling Council**, a collective body of bureaucrats that constituted the uppermost tier of the Galactic Empire. This way, a verticality of Power was established. Now, the government of the Empire had direct control of systems that were previously left unchecked. 

Now Empire can engage in Infrastructure projects, social programs, build an army of citizens, and not Clones. Basically Palpatine created first in the History of Galaxy **Galactic State,** where citizens do not associate themselves as citizen of a planet, but rather, a Galactic citizen.

The Blatant pacifism that the founders of the new republic tried to bake in were in essence killing it. If the prequel trilogy was looking at how rushing to war and going to conflict is bad, and if the OT was looking at how we sometimes must stand up against corruption and end violence, then the ST  era paints a picture of how dangerous running away from conflict or not preparing for it sensibly can be.

2350,What's your ranking of Rogue One?,"I've seen many fan rankings of the movies so far that have Rogue One at prequel-level quality. For instance, as recently as 10 minutes before I started typing this post, someone had ranked it lower than every film with the exception of The Phantom Menace. I know that rankings are subjective but I'm interested in understanding the reasoning behind some of the flak that this movie has gotten.

For me, my ranking of the films is as follows:

1. The Empire Strikes Back
2. New Hope
3. Rogue One
4. The Force Awakens
5. Return of the Jedi
6. The Last Jedi
7. Revenge of the Sith
8. Solo
9. The Phantom Menace
10. Attack of the Clones

Let me explain my rankings concerning Rogue One. I loved that the tone of this movie departed from that of the remaining films. The cinematography was my favorite in a Star Wars film. Color palettes that I'd generally expect to be bright and rich were dark and alluring (that opening scene with the grass, gray overcast, and death troopers was great). This is the Empire at the height of its power, and you can sense how despondent citizens are under its rule. Any organized resistance against the Empire operates from the shadows and groups are splintered and factionalized. Moreover, those groups understand the dire realities of facing the Empire. They view methods such as ""terrorist attacks,"" assassinations, and killing informants as often necessary to their cause. A standout scene is the skirmish between Saw Guerrera's forces and Imperial troops in Imperial-occupied Jedha City, which invoked memories of American-occupied Iraq.

Segueing to the characters, no character is spared from the conflict. Cassian is haunted by his actions, but he is willing to sacrifice his humanity in the name of the Alliance. However, his motivations sometimes waver between being against the tyranny of the Empire and seeking retribution for the death of his family (movie implies that the Empire killed his family at six years old). I think this distinction is notable in highlighting how nuanced Rebel motivations were at the time, as opposed to the standard ""good vs. evil"" trope of the original trilogy. And while TLJ played with this theme in the Finn and Rose subplot, it was too overt for me to take it seriously. Here, Rogue One's presentation is much more subtle.

Jyn's character, coupled with the general public's resignation to Empire control, presents a great illustration of how reluctant someone was to take up arms against the Empire. Her mother's death and the loss of her father presented a unique opportunity to fight back against the Empire once she joined Saw's forces, but Saw's abandonment of her left her questioning her place in the fight. Hell, but for the revelation that her father was alive and chose to conspire with the Alliance against the Empire, Jyn would not have rejoined the fight. Before that, she seemed content with staying on the sidelines, given how much she had lost. While all fanboys would seemingly gawk at the notion of not joining the rebellion, Jyn is representative of the larger public who has witnessed how costly this conflict is, and its understandable for some to resign themselves to being oppressed. Conversely, one's losses also render fighting back to be just as reasonable an option, and I think the movie plays with these themes very well. Do someone's losses motivate resistance or promote despondence? The answers aren't clear, and at least in my opinion, there aren't clear answers as to what one *should* do.

Note that these questions were presented with respect to Luke's predicament in TLJ. I personally didn't have a problem with the choices made regarding Luke. His motivations seemed real and genuine from a human perspective, although I understand they may not have appeared so given some fan expectations of Luke as this towering figure of heroism. But since the characters in Rogue One aren't powerful Jedi and have more distorted moral codes, I thought the above themes worked well in this movie.

I know that the characters themselves have been a main sticking point for critics of this movie. Funny enough, even though everyone's favorite character seems to be Chirrit Imwe, I didn't find his character very compelling. He's a cool character, no doubt, but Cassian and Jyn's motivations are much more nuanced, relatable, and are consistent with the movie's tone and themes.

Overall, I really enjoyed the film. I'm not someone promoting this film for the fanservice of Darth Vader's rampage (which was awesome, btw), but Rogue One seemed like the most ""human"" movie in the series. There are no Jedi, there are simply flawed people navigating their place in a corrupt universe, and being forced to live with the choices they make and the losses incurred. In the third act, the characters understand that they will die, but are content with their decision. There is no Ex Machina Millenium Falcon rescue. Instead, the slim prospect of gaining the upper hand on the Empire, hope that has yet to exist since the fall of the Republic, is enough for the Rogue One team to decide that that is their role in this conflict and, by extension, their place in this corrupt universe.

That said, what did you think of Rogue One? Is it prequel level quality? What did you like? What did you dislike? If you're someone who believes that its place is among Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace, do you think you may need to see a doctor? Do you need a guardian ad litem to decide for you?

The force responded by raising the light Rey to meet the dark Snoke. 

The ring Snoke wears is a Darth vader wedding ring. On the wrong finger cause he died. From the mustifar castle where vader performed the ritual. 

Snoke wanted to find Luke as hes his mother...

If Rey is the light side of padmes spirt then she's Luke's mom and s Skywalker.

Rey being born or the force would make her strong just like anakin

Rey being born of the force could mean she's just unlocking force abilities that she was already ""blessed"" with. She get touched by an ability it unlocks the ability in her.

Kilo was so inammered with Vader and being like him because all the stories from grandma snoke. 

Snoke and vader were living in his castle hiding him until after vader's death. 

Snoke stayed there in mourning till eventually ben solo ventured out to explore his families history for himself and came across snoke. They maintained a secret relationship. 

During the secret relationship snoke twisted the stories convincing ben/kilo that one powerful ruler could run th he galaxy just as vader believed.

2386,Luke’s episode VIII arc is a mini version of his father’s arc with notable differences,"In my opinion this “Jake” phase of Luke’s life is essentially his version of Anakin’s “Vader” phase. It’s less extreme. It hurts others less. However, there are some interesting parallels.

In both cases father and son were at their best when they embraced the Light side of the Force within. In both cases an issue tied to control lead to the Dark Side coming to both. For Anakin it was about control over Padme’s life following the loss of his mother. For Luke it was control over the family legacy after he’d devoted his life to righting his father’s wrongs and trying to improve the family’s and the Jedi’s future.

The Dark Side came to both in moments of weakness and whispered ideas as the Dark Side can. For Anakin it was to do anything to save Padme’s life. For Luke it was to do anything to save others from being hurt and another family member undoing all he’d spend decades building up to undo Vader’s legacy.

Anakin chooses darkness. Luke, as he had in ROTJ before, catches himself before it’s too late. He stops. However, where before Luke still got the happy ending for being able to stop... this time he and most importantly... others face negative consequences for listening to the Dark Side even briefly. And that turns his ability to fight evil against himself. He sees himself as the enemy because he’s never been responsible for the loss of so many innocent lives.

So, now, here we are with both father and on again around a temple massacre. One lead by Anakin by alllwing darkness in and one that Luke feels responsible for because he let it in briefly.

Anakin comes to place the blame on the Jedi Order staring, “From my perspective the Jedi are evil.” Luke comes to believe the Jedi are part of the problem as well after both his father and nephew being radicalized after being taught the ways of the Force from Jedi.

And so begins their dark periods. Anakin seeks more control over the galaxy. Luke seeks to control the fate of a religion. Just as before though Luke can’t go through with it. There’s a part of him who wants to rid the world of these books because he knows that they will forever keep the Jedi alive otherwise. And what’s more... they’re the oldest ideas that exist so any attempt by him to modernize any one specific order can simply be undone by a future fundamentalist who finds these books and chooses to reinstate the oldest ways. It’s the fundamentalist risk that seems to upset him most initially.

What’s fascinating here is that this period combines elements of his past. Here he’s stuck between do or do not with the books. Here he’s focused so much on the horizon of how to break the cycle forever that he’s missing the real issue right before him that’s holding him back. Where previously his choice to ignore his master’s and block out their advice lead him to redeeming his father... here he blocks them out and the force entirely and in does so when he needed them most. Where previously he was willing to sacrifice for others here he thinks he is helping others long term when he isn’t.

Most of all the lack of the Light twists each man’s identities. Vader becomes engulfed by the dark side and like a different person. Luke becomes engulfed by the absence of the force entirely and empty inside and like a different person too.

Both men get advice. Anakin from his son. Luke from Yoda. Anakin realizes he can control his son’s fate by defeating the emperor. Luke realizes there is a way forward with the Jedi and it involves not hiding Vader from Jedi teachings or hiding the failures of the Jedi but rather teaching them and talking about them. Both men realize their mistakes. Both men find themselves in situations where their loved ones are at risk and hope nearly seems lost. Both men find a way to save what they love and atone for their mistakes. Both the father and son then join the Light and are now together again.

So, yeah, Luke at his low point isn’t exactly like the Luke we used to know. Neither was his father at his low point and what’s fascinating about the arc is how we can see where father and son remained different from each other in how they handled these things and where they had similarities. A lot of fathers and sons can relate to becoming more alike as they get older but always with notable differences. 

And that’s why I love this arc.",StarWars,1543843737,DH80,2,1,True,2018-12-03

2408,"How the Force works: connection to the force, life energy reserves, resisting attacks with the Force, and why Obi-Wan beat Anakin on Mustafar","I got to thinking about this because of another user asking about why jedi don't just restrain general Grievous with the Force, and this was my comment. But I had a lot of fun with it and thought it might be an interesting read to some more people, so here's a post with it. I'd love to hear your opinions.

My personal theory/justification is that all living things have some natural ability to resist the Force. This is confirmed through the various species that are either wholly or somewhat resistant to it. The Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, the Yuuzhan Vong are completely cut off from the Force entirely, and ysalamari are even capable of projecting resistance to the Force to an area around them.

**Life force is critical**

Yoda speaks of how he, Luke and all living things are ""luminous beings"", and I believe this in some ways translates to how living things are connected to the Force, while dead things, such as droids, are not. I think that the stronger a life force is, the stronger that life force's connection to the Force can be. I say ""can"" because I believe, like Qui-Gon tells Anakin, that the ability to connect to the Force happens by attracting midichlorians to yourself. The more midichlorians clinging to you, the more power you can exert because you have more ""help"".

This also explains what at first glance may seem like inconsistencies, such as when Grievous in one episode of *The Clone Wars* can somewhat resist Obi-Wan's force powers, but in another is flung across the room like a ragdoll. Depending on how strong and ""full of life"" Grievous is at the given moment, his ability to resist a force user will fluctuate.

This is why we rarely see someone use the Force to dominate their opponent until they've been exhausted of their physical energy first; because unless one fighter is so massively more powerful in the Force than their opponent, their attempts might fail. I think if you *are* more powerful in the Force, you *can* simply ""plow through"" your opponent's Force defense, but I think it costs you much more energy-wise than if you manage to wear your opponent down first.

**Power in the Force VS Power in the Force and physical energy**

Example: Anakin has the strongest connection to the Force that we know of, and so is also potentially more powerful in the Force than anyone else could be. However, as is stated in his canon, he chose to mainly focus on his fighting abilities with a lightsaber, and a lightsaber form based on brute force at that. I think his ability to overpower his opponents is hampered by how ""unrefined"" his control of the Force is. He has amazing *natural affinity* and *instinctual* mastery of it, but as we've seen many times this often requires him to feel strong emotions before that can ""kick in"", and often does so in the form of darker displays of that power (such as Force Choke). While he showcases several truly extraordinary uses of the Force, I believe his control of it is a bit ""ineffective"" in that he ends up using more of his energy than needed if he had more refined control of it, like Obi-Wan does (who is noted to have a pretty weak connection to the Force, but has trained himself to mastery). I think of it kind of like Chakra control in the Narutoverse: in the beginning of the series, Naruto has horrible chakra control and ends up wasting a ton of it as ""spillage"" whenever he taps into his powers, but gets by because he has such massive reserves of it. Anakin is somewhat similar. That’s not to say Anakin isn’t talented with the force, of course, as he’s shown himself to be very talented with it, but he *is* more focused on how it can amplify his dueling/fighting ability than he is on learning to refine his control of it. This fits with his brash and aggressive personality as well as his lack of patience that we see displayed constantly, even after he becomes Darth Vader.

If Anakin – or anyone else, for that matter – could simply overpower someone with the Force due to his power advantage, we’d never really get proper duels; the fighters would just gauge each other’s Force strength and then flee/pursue depending on who was more powerful. This is why, when Anakin confronts Barriss Offee in TCW, he engages her in a duel instead of simply restraining her with the force; he had to/wanted to wear her down first to make her easier to control. Then, at the end, he easily stops her attack mid-air and slams her into a tree like she’s nothing; because she has been exhausted while he still has plenty of energy left. If he had done that at the beginning, I believe it would have cost him a lot more of his energy due to her being rested and subsequently better able to control her Force powers. When someone is tired, their control and defense wavers.

We see the same when Sidious fights Maul and Savage: he makes a display of power by immediately slamming them both into a wall, then drops them and engages in a fight. They are angered by this not just because he’s there to fight/challenge them, but because he disrespected them by flaunting his superiority in the Force before they had even drawn their lightsabers; he was basically telling them “look, shitheads, I am merely *playing* with you. I don’t mind wasting all this energy lifting your asses off the ground; I’ve got plenty more.” He ends their fight by once again effortlessly flinging Maul around, this time after also having physically exhausted him.

**Flesh, robotics and the Force**

Midichlorians cling to life. Some more than others. Robotics, such as droids, have no connections to the force because midichlorians want nothing to do with them; there is no life for the MCs to cling to and become part of. This is why Anakin was considered to be so weakened after his fight with Obi-Wan; his life force, as a consequence of losing so many limbs and bodily functions, was severely restricted. The MCs didn’t find him as attractive anymore.

However, this is where things get interesting about Anakin. Now that his life force was weakened, that huge reservoir of Force energy he accessed earlier as Anakin Skywalker was unavailable to him, save for a little. And not only was he no longer the same person physically, his entire being was changed; he had become Darth Vader, truly. Instead of whatever light in himself he drew on before to access his power, he now had to use his rage and hate to access similar levels of strength. So he did. Boy, did he. These new midichlorians (MCs) that clung to him are ones attracted to other “forces” than what the MCs a jedi normally attracts are; they feed on hate and anger and other really strong emotions. Vader’s immense hate and rage attracted many of these MCs, and while his life force was not the same, this new “force” in him could compensate somewhat for that, though he naturally still had an above-average connection to the Force as well.

And not only did he gather power through his hate and anger, he also finally started refining his control of the Force, increasing his ability to wield what energy he had effectively. He may not have had the same reserves of energy anymore, but he could control it much more accurately and became a far stronger Force user because of it – though his injuries still limited him. You can almost “sympathize” with how infuriating this must have been for Sidious to watch; he had planned to train Anakin – at his full potential – personally, to hone him into a sith who was a master of technical combat (like Anakin was), could amplify his fighting abilities with the Force (like Anakin had done), had massive reserves of energy to draw on (as Anakin naturally had) *and* who did not waste any of that energy when he used it (like Vader learned). He wasn’t kidding when he called Anakin the perfect apprentice – he had the potential to max out all his stats, all he needed was Sidious’ tutelage. But then Obi-Wan fucked that up for him.

**Why Obi-Wan fought evenly with Anakin and eventually beat him**

I mentioned how Obi-Wan is confirmed to have a pretty weak connection to the Force, which led to him almost not being accepted as a jedi at all, until Qui-Gon took him as a Padawan. So how did he beat Anakin? Well, that ties into what I’ve talked about in the above sections.

First of all, he trained Anakin, and as such he knew him extremely well. They knew each other’s fighting styles and had sparred many times. Knowing each other’s moves makes the fight more dependent on using your head to trick your opponent, which I believe Troll Master Kenobi has an advantage in.

Also, I believe the Force was truly with him during that fight, and by that I mean that he had the support of an extraordinary amount of MCs during it. This is what allowed him to go toe-to-toe with Anakin when they tried to Force Push each other and both were sent flying; regardless of how refined Obi-Wan’s control of the Force may be, if he smashes his Force energy against Anakin’s Anakin should win unless he runs out of energy himself – which is obviously not the case as they keep fighting. This leads me to think that he was aided by more MCs than he usually would; he attracted more of them at that point than he normally does.

Another reason is the fact that Anakin, being in the midst of a HUGE change in his personal being, is sending very mixed signals to his MCs, both repelling and attracting new and old MCs due to the conflict between his new dark and hateful feelings and the old lingering affectionate ones from his jedi life. While the new dark MCs clinging to him gave him more direct power, he had not “gotten to know” them and connected properly, and this chaos inside him aided Obi-Wan during their fight.

However, I believe Obi-Wan’s amazing mastery of his connection to the Force, weak as it may be, is the main reason he came out walking and waving from their fight. As opposed to Anakin, he does very much with very little, wasting almost none of his energy when employing the Force. He has reached this level of mastery through training and perseverance, which makes him so impressive – something Mace Windu acknowledges. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Rock Lee of Star Wars.

Dooku, I think, had a similar talent – incredibly refined in his control of the Force. This, in addition to most likely having a much bigger energy pool, allowed him to break through Obi-Wan’s defenses as they were fighting in Episode 3 and fling him across the room. He was planning on killing Obi-Wan in that fight (confirmed in the novelization), so I think the only reason he didn’t just crush his throat was that Obi-Wan managed to just barely mount a Force defense that protected him from it, forcing Dooku to either waste an unacceptable amount of energy to brute force a kill on him before Anakin could come to Kenobi’s assistance or to throw him across the room and restrain him instead, like he did. Obi-Wan gets a lot of shit for how easily Dooku overpowered him, but this fails to recognize the fact that Obi-Wan is very vulnerable when faced with a Force-using opponent. Should the opponent have a sufficient energy reserve to overpower him, and knowledge of Kenobi’s own low reserves, they *could* end the fight early by simply overpowering him. This is why Obi-Wan would not even get close to Sidious before being completely restrained, if he were to confront him; Sidious has the same refined control of the Force, massive reserves of power and an incredible skill with a lightsaber. He is a terrible match-up and would annihilate Obi-Wan – which makes me all the more gleeful thinking of how pissed he must have been at the thought of a “weakling” like Kenobi sabotaging his plans to make Anakin into the perfect sith.

All in all, I believe the combination of Obi-Wan’s mastery and training, the Force being with him (granting him a larger reserve of energy), Anakin’s inner turmoil and unfamiliarity with the dark side and, finally, Obi-Wan’s cleverness was what granted him victory that day.

My VHS copy did, though, and the only way the DVD copy could get them is if I were to edit the files or whatever to get them in, which I have no knowledge on how to do

So I wanna ask, do the Blu-Ray films include alien subtitles? It'd be rather annoying if it didn't... :|",StarWars,1543865281,Legolou12,1,1,True,2018-12-03

2415,"How the Force works: connection to the force, life energy reserves, resisting attacks with the Force, and why Obi-Wan beat Anakin on Mustafar","I got to thinking about this because of another user asking about why jedi don't just restrain general Grievous with the Force, and this was my comment. But I had a lot of fun with it and thought it might be an interesting read to some more people, so here's a post with it. I'd love to hear your opinions.

My personal theory/justification is that all living things have some natural ability to resist the Force. This is confirmed through the various species that are either wholly or somewhat resistant to it. The Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, the Yuuzhan Vong are completely cut off from the Force entirely, and ysalamari are even capable of projecting resistance to the Force to an area around them.

**Life force is critical**

Yoda speaks of how he, Luke and all living things are ""luminous beings"", and I believe this in some ways translates to how living things are connected to the Force, while dead things, such as droids, are not. I think that the stronger a life force is, the stronger that life force's connection to the Force can be. I say ""can"" because I believe, like Qui-Gon tells Anakin, that the ability to connect to the Force happens by attracting midichlorians to yourself. The more midichlorians clinging to you, the more power you can exert because you have more ""help"".

This also explains what at first glance may seem like inconsistencies, such as when Grievous in one episode of *The Clone Wars* can somewhat resist Obi-Wan's force powers, but in another is flung across the room like a ragdoll. Depending on how strong and ""full of life"" Grievous is at the given moment, his ability to resist a force user will fluctuate.

This is why we rarely see someone use the Force to dominate their opponent until they've been exhausted of their physical energy first; because unless one fighter is so massively more powerful in the Force than their opponent, their attempts might fail. I think if you *are* more powerful in the Force, you *can* simply ""plow through"" your opponent's Force defense, but I think it costs you much more energy-wise than if you manage to wear your opponent down first.

**Power in the Force VS Power in the Force and physical energy**

Example: Anakin has the strongest connection to the Force that we know of, and so is also potentially more powerful in the Force than anyone else could be. However, as is stated in his canon, he chose to mainly focus on his fighting abilities with a lightsaber, and a lightsaber form based on brute force at that. I think his ability to overpower his opponents is hampered by how ""unrefined"" his control of the Force is. He has amazing *natural affinity* and *instinctual* mastery of it, but as we've seen many times this often requires him to feel strong emotions before that can ""kick in"", and often does so in the form of darker displays of that power (such as Force Choke). While he showcases several truly extraordinary uses of the Force, I believe his control of it is a bit ""ineffective"" in that he ends up using more of his energy than needed if he had more refined control of it, like Obi-Wan does (who is noted to have a pretty weak connection to the Force, but has trained himself to mastery). I think of it kind of like Chakra control in the Narutoverse: in the beginning of the series, Naruto has horrible chakra control and ends up wasting a ton of it as ""spillage"" whenever he taps into his powers, but gets by because he has such massive reserves of it. Anakin is somewhat similar. That’s not to say Anakin isn’t talented with the force, of course, as he’s shown himself to be very talented with it, but he *is* more focused on how it can amplify his dueling/fighting ability than he is on learning to refine his control of it. This fits with his brash and aggressive personality as well as his lack of patience that we see displayed constantly, even after he becomes Darth Vader.

If Anakin – or anyone else, for that matter – could simply overpower someone with the Force due to his power advantage, we’d never really get proper duels; the fighters would just gauge each other’s Force strength and then flee/pursue depending on who was more powerful. This is why, when Anakin confronts Barriss Offee in TCW, he engages her in a duel instead of simply restraining her with the force; he had to/wanted to wear her down first to make her easier to control. Then, at the end, he easily stops her attack mid-air and slams her into a tree like she’s nothing; because she has been exhausted while he still has plenty of energy left. If he had done that at the beginning, I believe it would have cost him a lot more of his energy due to her being rested and subsequently better able to control her Force powers. When someone is tired, their control and defense wavers.

We see the same when Sidious fights Maul and Savage: he makes a display of power by immediately slamming them both into a wall, then drops them and engages in a fight. They are angered by this not just because he’s there to fight/challenge them, but because he disrespected them by flaunting his superiority in the Force before they had even drawn their lightsabers; he was basically telling them “look, shitheads, I am merely *playing* with you. I don’t mind wasting all this energy lifting your asses off the ground; I’ve got plenty more.” He ends their fight by once again effortlessly flinging Maul around, this time after also having physically exhausted him.

**Flesh, robotics and the Force**

Midichlorians cling to life. Some more than others. Robotics, such as droids, have no connections to the force because midichlorians want nothing to do with them; there is no life for the MCs to cling to and become part of. This is why Anakin was considered to be so weakened after his fight with Obi-Wan; his life force, as a consequence of losing so many limbs and bodily functions, was severely restricted. The MCs didn’t find him as attractive anymore.

However, this is where things get interesting about Anakin. Now that his life force was weakened, that huge reservoir of Force energy he accessed earlier as Anakin Skywalker was unavailable to him, save for a little. And not only was he no longer the same person physically, his entire being was changed; he had become Darth Vader, truly. Instead of whatever light in himself he drew on before to access his power, he now had to use his rage and hate to access similar levels of strength. So he did. Boy, did he. These new midichlorians (MCs) that clung to him are ones attracted to other “forces” than what the MCs a jedi normally attracts are; they feed on hate and anger and other really strong emotions. Vader’s immense hate and rage attracted many of these MCs, and while his life force was not the same, this new “force” in him could compensate somewhat for that, though he naturally still had an above-average connection to the Force as well.

And not only did he gather power through his hate and anger, he also finally started refining his control of the Force, increasing his ability to wield what energy he had effectively. He may not have had the same reserves of energy anymore, but he could control it much more accurately and became a far stronger Force user because of it – though his injuries still limited him. You can almost “sympathize” with how infuriating this must have been for Sidious to watch; he had planned to train Anakin – at his full potential – personally, to hone him into a sith who was a master of technical combat (like Anakin was), could amplify his fighting abilities with the Force (like Anakin had done), had massive reserves of energy to draw on (as Anakin naturally had) *and* who did not waste any of that energy when he used it (like Vader learned). He wasn’t kidding when he called Anakin the perfect apprentice – he had the potential to max out all his stats, all he needed was Sidious’ tutelage. But then Obi-Wan fucked that up for him.

**Why Obi-Wan fought evenly with Anakin and eventually beat him**

I mentioned how Obi-Wan is confirmed to have a pretty weak connection to the Force, which led to him almost not being accepted as a jedi at all, until Qui-Gon took him as a Padawan. So how did he beat Anakin? Well, that ties into what I’ve talked about in the above sections.

First of all, he trained Anakin, and as such he knew him extremely well. They knew each other’s fighting styles and had sparred many times. Knowing each other’s moves makes the fight more dependent on using your head to trick your opponent, which I believe Troll Master Kenobi has an advantage in.

Also, I believe the Force was truly with him during that fight, and by that I mean that he had the support of an extraordinary amount of MCs during it. This is what allowed him to go toe-to-toe with Anakin when they tried to Force Push each other and both were sent flying; regardless of how refined Obi-Wan’s control of the Force may be, if he smashes his Force energy against Anakin’s Anakin should win unless he runs out of energy himself – which is obviously not the case as they keep fighting. This leads me to think that he was aided by more MCs than he usually would; he attracted more of them at that point than he normally does.

Another reason is the fact that Anakin, being in the midst of a HUGE change in his personal being, is sending very mixed signals to his MCs, both repelling and attracting new and old MCs due to the conflict between his new dark and hateful feelings and the old lingering affectionate ones from his jedi life. While the new dark MCs clinging to him gave him more direct power, he had not “gotten to know” them and connected properly, and this chaos inside him aided Obi-Wan during their fight.

However, I believe Obi-Wan’s amazing mastery of his connection to the Force, weak as it may be, is the main reason he came out walking and waving from their fight. As opposed to Anakin, he does very much with very little, wasting almost none of his energy when employing the Force. He has reached this level of mastery through training and perseverance, which makes him so impressive – something Mace Windu acknowledges. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Rock Lee of Star Wars.

Dooku, I think, had a similar talent – incredibly refined in his control of the Force. This, in addition to most likely having a much bigger energy pool, allowed him to break through Obi-Wan’s defenses as they were fighting in Episode 3 and fling him across the room. He was planning on killing Obi-Wan in that fight (confirmed in the novelization), so I think the only reason he didn’t just crush his throat was that Obi-Wan managed to just barely mount a Force defense that protected him from it, forcing Dooku to either waste an unacceptable amount of energy to brute force a kill on him before Anakin could come to Kenobi’s assistance or to throw him across the room and restrain him instead, like he did. Obi-Wan gets a lot of shit for how easily Dooku overpowered him, but this fails to recognize the fact that Obi-Wan is very vulnerable when faced with a Force-using opponent. Should the opponent have a sufficient energy reserve to overpower him, and knowledge of Kenobi’s own low reserves, they *could* end the fight early by simply overpowering him. This is why Obi-Wan would not even get close to Sidious before being completely restrained, if he were to confront him; Sidious has the same refined control of the Force, massive reserves of power and an incredible skill with a lightsaber. He is a terrible match-up and would annihilate Obi-Wan – which makes me all the more gleeful thinking of how pissed he must have been at the thought of a “weakling” like Kenobi sabotaging his plans to make Anakin into the perfect sith.

All in all, I believe the combination of Obi-Wan’s mastery and training, the Force being with him (granting him a larger reserve of energy), Anakin’s inner turmoil and unfamiliarity with the dark side and, finally, Obi-Wan’s cleverness was what granted him victory that day.

Beckett died by Han's hand. I know she said that to protect him. And it works. But I don't think Maul is stupid. He'll see cracks in Qi'ra's story.

2420,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie, fight me IRL","Why I think it's the best: 

This movie makes A New Hope 10× better and even without A New Hope it would have been a great film. It captured what no other Star Wars film has captured and that is that it's about a War. A brutal unforgiving war filled with conflict even amongst the good guys on what is right and wrong. The darkness of it makes it clear that this conflict between the rebels and the imperials is deep and full of serious consequences. 

I also love that they didn't pay too much attention to character development since it was never about the individuals, it was about the plot and the ideology, the war, the mega weapon that if not destroyed would sow up imperial control of the galaxy crushing the rebellion into oblivion. Not to mention Darth Vader, he was involved very little until the end and everytime he was shown it was dramatic and serious. 

That last scene is the best depiction of a sith ever in a Star Wars movie. The fear in the soldiers faces when his light saber illuminated him in the narrow corridor was exactly what the reaction should be for anyone running into a sith. It was orgasmic. 

I'm not the best with words and articulating things but I just feel like this entire movie from start to finish was great, it wasn't perfect but no movie is, but I would comfortably say it is the best movie, followed by ESB. I don't feel ESB should be my favorite just based on the fact it was in the original trilogy. The new main series by Disney is ruined and I feel like these standalones are all we really have now. I'm hoping other directors can follow in the footsteps of Rogue One and make more dark films like this. I would die for a rated R Star Wars...

2430,My Ideal Star Wars game (RPG),"I remember a post awhile ago speaking on the state of Star Wars in video games. To which i replied what would be in my ideal Star Wars game. Since the ip belongs to EA i doubt it will ever come, they are scumbags who monetize the shit out of something that seriously doesn't need it. That's not what i want, i dont want to have to bring my wallet out every time i want to play. What i want is the following.

\- An interesting Story and likable/relateable Characters

\- Good combat, both in lightsaber, force, and blaster areas.

\- Fun exploration and maneuverability (like force movements in BFI and BFII and Jetpacks)

\- Good character progression and customization, let me be who i want to be in the Star Wars Universe

\- Accurate or at least decent portrayal of the lore and world created by George Lucas and so many others.

\- Interactions with NPC, let me make alliances, romance and betrayals. With my friends and enemies

\- Modding Support

I ask for these things, some will say ""You're asking for too much"" But im asking for a decent RPG, Skyrim had most of these, as did Witcher as did Dragon Age: Origins, and so many other games. Hell KOTOR had most of this. I want a Star Wars game with a good story and really fun and engaging combat, and one that made me want to go out and explore and rewarded me for looking around. Why is this so much to ask now-a-days? These aren't even that large of request, most of them should be a standard for video game (Their making a come-back that's for damn sure) But their few and far between today. Kotor will still be my baby, but it's dated and has lost some of the flair i loved so much (I still play it though). SWTOR is also good only if you don't mind the shitty business model and MMO structure. But i think this is the game that a lot of people want (Could be wrong dont kill me pls).

2437,[SPOILER] One thing I have a problem with in TLJ,"I guess first let me say I am first and foremost a massive fan of the OT, saw it for the first time when I was 7. The Phantom Menace came out when I was 10, as a little kid I loved it. To be honest I still do and think it gets way too much heat. AotC is probably my least favourite out of all of them but I have time for RotS. The direction they chose to take with the story in Force Awakens did disappoint me a little, but overall I found it very enjoyable and watched it many times. Rogue One I absolutely love, right up there in my rankings. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not just another person who hates everything not OT. 

The problem I refer to is the Holdo hyperspace kamikaze scene in TLJ. My first time seeing it in the cinema went a bit like this... ""Oh no she ain't."" ""Holy crap that's incredible. "" ""Hang on a second.""

My moment of pause came as I absorbed the sheer destructive power of this manoeuvre, and suddenly my awe turned to disdain as I thought to myself, ""Well hang on a second, why ever fly down a trench and try to fire missiles through a booby trapped exhaust port when you can do that?"" 

It opens up all these new possibilities. Both Death Stars could have been destroyed this way for a start, making the plot of both Rogue One and much of ANH completely redundant. 

Why would Galen Erso put so much effort into hiding a booby trap in an exhaust vent that sets off a chain reaction if and only if a small fighter can penetrate immense surface defenses and TIE fighter resistance and strike a target the size of a womp rat, when a man of such knowledge has to know that a medium sized ship in hyperspace would at least cripple it indefinitely. 

You could just line ships up to keep hitting it if ones not enough. Doesn't even have to be kamikaze since droids exist in this universe. Or what about since you can fit a hyperspace drive in an X-Wing, someone would surely think to devise a form of hyperspace torpedo? 

I guess I am so incredulous because I've always just understood hyperspace to exist outside of our regular space and time. Skipping to another franchise I love, in Star Gate there's an episode where they ""micro jump"" as asteroid heading for earth through the planet and out the other side using the hyperdrive of a cargo ship. It works because in hyperspace you can't hit anything. 

NB. I am aware that this scene was explained in the novelisation as though the destructive power was like it was due to experimental shields on the Raddus. Personally I think all movies have to be able to stand on their own, and having to explain things in novels like this is just shoddy writing. Also, I don't think that really helps with my main problem here which is been able to hit things in hyperspace is a fairly new thing to me. 

Anyway looking forward to hearing what people think. Not here to start another hate train on TLJ, just hopefully thoughtful discussion. Maybe someone will be able to point to a precedent for this in the trilogies or EU which I've forgotten or not super familiar with!",StarWars,1543902110,koko_gogo,48,1,True,2018-12-04

2439,Why does the larger community superimpose names like Dreadnought and Executor-class to Imperial/First Order ships,"I never really understood the desire of the community to try and force ships in the Star Wars universe to conform to Earth-based naval terminology, roles, and naming conventions. I know that Imperial-class, Imperial II-class, Super-class, and Mega-class Star Destroyer all sound kind of dumb, but it fits with the Ego-centric, Arrogant attitude of the Imperial and FO leaders.  


On top of that, it seems the community tries to super-impose ship types onto these ship like they are in Earth-based navies as well. Despite the name ""Star Destroyer"", I don't think that was ever meant to imply these were destroyers, but rather a Product line meant to inspire fear and dread. In fact, the closest to ship type definitions are brief mentions of the ""Jedi Attack Cruiser"" (Venator-class) and ""Big Corellian cruisers"" (Imperial-class).  


Never once have I seen any canonical reference to a Super or Mega Star Destroyer as a ""Star Dreadnought"" (Which wasn't even a ship type in real militaries, but a nickname given to large, imposing battleships during WW1 and early WW2). Really the Star Destroyer line doesn't fit any modern military as they act as Battleship/Carrier hybrids of varying size, with the larger ones acting more as Command ships than ""Dreadnoughts"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Name : Star Wars Episode IX : The New Rebellion**

**The story :** 

The resistance was destroyed, only a group survived and are abroad the Falcon, General Leia tells Rey to fly to the naboo planet as it is one of the five planets who are still loyal to the resistance

There, in a hidden base near the naboo's palace, the remaining resistance fighters gathers, discussing what should be done to stop the First order

We cut then to a first order star destroyer, we see lando calrisian in a first order officer suit walking and giving commands to communicate to general hux

Lando : General Hux

Hux : yes, officer Neon?

Lando : The kaminoans has confirmed that they started the work on the new weapon

Hux : Good, the details of your next mission will be given to you shortly

Lando : yes sir

&amp;#x200B;

Lando closes the call and goes with 2 stormtroopers into a dark room where he starts a call with general Leia

Leia : Lando ! your timing couldnt be better

Lando : I can confirm now, the first order is working on a new weapon with the kaminoans, i am still not sure what it is, but knowing the first order, it could be another star killer, but we will have to wait and see, my next mission will be more likely going to kamino and checking the progress of the weapon, i will tell you once i have the information, i have to go now

cancelling the call, lando turns to the stormtroopers (who are actually two people from cloud city) and goes out of the room 

&amp;#x200B;

cutting back to the falcon, where rey, chewi and finn are still inside

Rey gets out starring at the base, her mind is still on what she did on crait, she sighs and looks at the horizon, suddenly she hears a weird laugh near the palace, she goes to check it to feel a cold feeling and see a small glowing thing inside the destroyed thrown room, she walk slowly inside, and sees an open drawer of some kind, she gets close and sees a bunch of pieces with a yellow crystal in the middle

??? : The weapon of a jedi knight...

Rey gasps and turns around quickly to see a little green creature, he looked like a ghost, she pulls her blaster and points it at it

Rey : who are you ?

Yoda (duh) : Matters not, who you are the question is

Rey looks at the ghost, confused as hell, yoda laughs at her confusion and points his stick at the crystal

Yoda : put it together

Rey : i...i dont know how

Yoda : of course you dont, the force knows, reach for it you must

Rey temples for a while, she reaches for the crystal, the crystal suddenly melts

Yoda : \*sigh\* no, reach for it with your mind first

Rey : I still dont know who you even are !

Yoda : a friend to a friend you know, i am

Rey looks confused for a second, then realizes what is happening

Rey : you must be luke's master...

Yoda : I am

Rey : Then please ! teach me ! Ben solo will destroy everything and i know-

Yoda : shhh... a lightsaber you need first, now, relax, feel the force around you and into the crystal

Rey stops and turns to the melted crystals, she closes her eye and reach slowly for the crystal, yoda's eyes are wide open (like in TESB) when Rey touches the crystal, suddenly the crystal goes back to solid form, and glows with Blue

**.....to be continued**

I mean, Luke was using lightsaber a lot in those three years as shown in the flagship comic series from 2015, but never received any actual training. So he was familiar with fighting with that weapon, well enough to kind of hold his own with Vader and even hit him once in EP5, even though Anakin was pretty much toying with him. Then he goes through actual lightsaber training with Yoda (not that it was shown, but Yoda says he taught him everything by now) in the gap year between ESB and ROTJ. You can see it when Luke deflects the blaster shots, does some spins with the saber and stuff, flips around. He fights like your average Jedi from PT would fight. Anakin had 10 years of training when he was pretty much a master in EP2, while Luke is ""just"" competent after 4 years of having a lightsaber (including less than one year of actual training).

2466,Why Disney is killing my love for Star Wars,"I want to talk about the beast, the alpha, the multibillion dollar company that is Disney! (And why they’re killing Star Wars)

Okay I know I’m late to this, there’s been others that have talked about this but I want to input my two cents in as well.  As most people do I grew up playing the video games, reading some of the books, watching shows, and the movies. I’ve seen them all, even numerous fan fiction ones because, why not? Hell I even wrote fan fic, I was obsessed and then, they introduced the new series/movies and I couldn’t be more disappointed in a franchise.

I’m not going to say that all of the original movies (1-6) are perfect because that would be lunacy but they have crafted a certain line of stories that are universal and are enjoyable to watch. Then after the sixth one they took that and went AWOL with it.

I can spend a lot of time praising the original ones (1-6) but that’s not what I’m here to do, I’m here to talk about the new ones.

They are so underwhelming, boring, and bland. In the prequels you are reminded that there is a war, they show much violence as they can without getting that R rating, and even the original ones (77-83) there is violence and yes, you are still reminded that there is a war.

Now the new ones it doesn’t feel like these a intergalactic struggle between dark and light, it feels like there’s just some Mary Sues running around with guns and lightsabers. I feel as if they’re never in real danger, no real harm, I know they’ll be okay, and hey! Why not add a bunch of jokes because nothing is funnier than a galactic civil war.

Yes some people died in the shows and movies but they’re quickly turned around with jokes and a happy ending nonetheless. There’s nothing gritty, there’s nothing that makes me sit back in my seat and say “Wow, that was actually spectacular.” No matter how visually stunning you can make it, characters make and break it (in my opinion). 

I’m not asking for a dramatic war movie but show off the shows strengths’ for crying out loud. You have space wizards wielding swords made out of lasers, how did you manage to not make that entertaining? 

I understand they’re pandering to a new wave of fans but it’s killing The series, it’s killing the characters that were created, it’s killing the intricate universe that was made, Disney, stop killing it.",StarWars,1543957693,Slade470,15,1,True,2018-12-04

So we all know that Obi Wan and Vader squared off in episode IV, ending with Vader swinging his light saber through Obi Wan, with his overalls just dropping to the floor. In TLJ, Luke is apparently a hologram on the battlefield from his distant island when Kylo Ren swings his saber through him. Luke’s robe falls off him on his island.

2482,The current run of Darth Vader (comic) is everything that I want in Star Wars movies (Spoilers for the Darth Vader comic through #24),"(Spoilers for the Darth Vader comic through #24)

My friends and I often talk about how we would make the Star Wars movies, and I think the current run of Darth Vader is a great representation. In an effort to keep things consise, here are some of the elements that I would love to see in the movies:

*Ancient lore/mythology surrounding the Force, Siths, and Jedis. Give me some background on a character from a thousand years ago. Create a mystery around an artifact or holocron that a current character discovers (why put the Jedi Texts in the TLJ just to say they don't matter?)
*Fun, frenetic action using the force and sabers. I want to see characters at their most powerful - I want to see Kylo unleash his rage, I want to see Rey tap into the ultimate center of the Light side to put down some enemies. I get it, we can't see all characters bring down a Star Destroyer with the force, we have to put a maximum limit on it, but still, give me something badass!
*Trim the fat on the mainstream, cheesy, unnecessary character dialog. It's ok to make a more serious Star Wars film. You can do this while still having it be funny and acceptable for a broad range. I am aware of the fact that I am approaching this from a 'hardcore' fans perspective (the 18-35 demogrpahic), but anyone that tells you that you can't do it this way is just wrong. 

Have you all seen the CG trailers for Old Republic game? The fight choreography, and overall force-use badass-edness would make the movies what everyone wants. For the life of me, I cannot understand how Kathleen Kennedy gave the reins to Rian Johnson, who just proceeded to subvert everything good about Star Wars. Why couldn't have Luke actually been on Crait, and laid waste to the First Order there. He could have still 'inspired hope across the galaxy' if he had been there in person. 

You know that line where Luke says, “You think what? I’m gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order?”........YES. Who wouldn't want to see that? I would have been 100% ok with him dying in that scene had he actually been present. Destroy an AT-M6 with the force. I would have seen that movie 10 times in theater.

What is inarguably the most amazing scene from Rogue One? Yup, when Vader destroys the Rebel troops at the end of the movie. Everyone loved that scene. People were hollering in the theater when I saw it. 

I know I have a biased view here, but I am 100% certain that had Episodes 7 or 8 had more lore, more mythology, more force action, they would have been loved more by fans. This is hyperbole, but my friends and I always joke that if we were on the Star Wars Story team, we could give the fans what they want. ",StarWars,1543969764,brohbafett,32,1,True,2018-12-04

2488,Star Wars movie concept part I,"Ok so I got and idea about some characters and a plot and stuff and decided to write a movie script about it.

I'm no film maker and not even a native english speaker, but I managed to write up a prologue to the movie. The names are really basic and can change in the future.

It takes place in the Jedi purge era, beginning of rebellion. It centers in an unnamed group of rebels doing their thing. It's really a prototype right now.

Here it comes, let me hear your thoughts in the coment section please:
-----------------------

Prologue

Film opens with a shot at a Colony from above which drops to the ground to show the Empire enslaving the native species.

Then it shifts into the governors cabin where the governor himself objects to the harsh way the imp. forces treat the natives. The imperial commander responds aggresivelly, giving the impression of a maniac.

The governors child strolls into the room, when the maniac is leaving, making a dramatic scene between the look of the child and the maniac. Governor tells the child that ""justice needs order, even if it looks bad sometimes.""

Cut to space, the space station above the planet is suddenly attacked by rebel forces. Only a handful of 
X-wings are seen, but soon, the rest of the fleet joins them. Two X-wing pilots seem to cooperate and lead the squadron.

Imperials on the station freak out and a brief moment is shown of them panicking.

Cut to the cabin of the first pilot, ""this is Commander Zane, destroy their comms, then follow to landfall.""
His face is obsured by large goggles of his helmet, showing only scarred face of a middle-aged man benieth.

Then cut to the second pilot, a similarly aged woman with sleek body frame. ""There are too many of them Zane"".

Back to first pilot, ""just more to kill,"" he responds.

A fierce dogfight is seen showcasing the pilots flying ability.

Then they push through in a formation and a large number of rebels manages to land on the surface.

Huge battle goes on, as rebels are trying to breach into  the imperial base D-day style. A rebel commander is seen talking into his comm while a wounded soldier is treated by his side. ""We are dying out here!"" He screams, requesting air support.

The screen shifts to a landing X-wing with unusual markings. The scarred man jumps out. Screen shows only his feet and a helmet falling by his boots as he slowly strolls towards the battle. This countinues with him pulling out a blaster pistol and shooting down stormtroopers in quick succession, all without revealing his identity.

Cut to a vantage point, the woman from the X-wing is seen sniping troopers from a vantage point. She opens her comm, ""I hope this is worth it Seth, you know I don't like it"". 

""Just this once..."" he responds with a cut to him fighting in dark corridors with other rebels. ""You always say that"" is heard from her. He pushes the other troopers aside as the camera finally reveals his face. His eyes closed, his silver-brown hair tied back, a large old scar from a blaster goes across the left side of his face to the back of his head, making him look disturbing.

He takes something off his belt and frowns. An audio flashback turns up in his mind of screams and death and the whole scene is slowed down. His hard breathing is heard as he closes his eyes and shows his teeth in anger.

Suddenly he opens his eyes, revealing his milky left blind eye and glowing red right eye. The scene returns to normal speed as he ignites his blue lightsaber and brutally slashes at approaching stormtroopers.

He screams in anger as he cuts away those troopers limb from limb like a savage. He's more of a barbarian than a duelist as his technique is based on raw power.

Rebels behind him hold back in fear, as they know they should. He then singlehandedly murders everyone in his path, even those pleading for mercy. When he finally gets into the command center, bodyguards attack him. He disposes of them quickly and proceeds to the governor with his child behind him. ""Please"" says the governor while holding down his blaster, but the barbarian is in a deep trance by now, his mind set to kill. He raises the saber and strikes him down without second thought. When the body falls as the child is watching, he again raises the blade. But his eyes lock with the child's and anger starts to slowly leave him.

As he realizes where he is, he drops the lightsaber, turning it off. And confused sits down shivering in pain. Another scene shows the rebels going around amidst those smoking bodies.

""It's over, finally..."" says the woman's voice.

Most of his troop will have defected to the Rebellion, but he remains loyal to the Empire. The movie ends with the invasion of Hoth but from the Empire's perspective with Vader and Death Troopers and the Empire's most elite forces like Inferno Squad. Battlefront the movie, basically.

The DSII was going to blow up anyway with Palpatine and Vader on it.","Again, this isn't for argument it's for discussion.

Point:

The Throne Room scene is necessary for the story for the final confrontation between Luke/Vader and the redemption of Anakin Skywalker however...

The throne room sequence happens independently of the Battle of Endor.  

Without this confrontation, the shield generator still is destroyed by ground forces

The battle still goes as it did with the Rebel Fleet able to penetrate the DSII defenses and destroy the reactor core.

If Luke was turned to the Dark Side or killed all three are killed anyway with the destruction of the DSII

The Rebellion wins the battle, the ensuing events all take place with or without Luke in the same manner.

The only counter point would be if Luke never made it to the DSII to confront Vader the Palpatine would have active control over the battle (which until the EU invented battle meditation this wasn't even a thing) and Vader could have personally taken part in the space battle outside in his own fighter, but this would also likely leave Luke in a position to also participate in the space battle to potentially take Vader out of the battle as a whole and either delay/destroy Vader in the space battle. 

Vader could also have been deployed with ground forces to protect the shield generator but in my estimation of the emperor's overconfidence, he didn't believe the rebels would be able to mount an attack capable of doing it thus still having Vader by his side during the battle for their moment of triumph.  

If you take continuity as it existed at the release of ROTJ the rebel fleet still wins the battle regardless. 

The best part of the movie... and possibly the best moment in all of Star Wars didn't have any meaning to the GCW as a whole which is kind of an outlier because throughout the first 2 movies the actions of Luke and Vader were directly affecting the conduct and outcome of the GCW.

You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.""

So lets theorize that Leia made it to Tatooine not being pursued by Vader.  She escaped his clutches over Scarrif and safely landed on Tatooine.  She finds Kenobi, relays her fathers message in person.

So - does Obi Wan actually leave guarding Luke and go with Leia or tell her to piss off?   I know Bail knows Obi Wan is there to look after the boy, but I dont think Bail knows how important Luke is to the Jedi cause - or the fate of the galaxy for that matter.  

  
But, also destroying the EMPIRE - along with Vader - could help the galaxy at large also.  

&amp;#x200B;

Its a tough spot for Kenobi to be in.  I dont think Lars would have let Luke go with Kenobi if he was still alive - so the option of bringing Luke with him isnt realistic.

2525,[Crazy sequels theory] All the new characters are seeings things that aren't there - they're being indoctrinated with propaganda!,"**What actually happened according to this theory**

After their defeat on Endor, the Empire lost control of many planets throughout the galaxy, leaving the New Republic as the main power in the Galaxy. However, some remnants of the Empire refuse to surrender despite the loss of their Emperor. Controlled by the enigmatic Maz Kanata, an old Admiral of the Empire, they call themselves ""the Resistance"" to the Republic. Facing troop shortages - Kamino had been captured fairly early on - they resort to ever more desperate recruitment strategies. Their main problem is that the entire galaxy seems to consider them as ""bad guys"" and are extremely unwilling to fight for them. To get around this, they kidnap children at a young age and indoctrinate them using special mindcontrol helmets, that are fused directly onto their skulls so can never be removed. These helmets are based on the idea of 'real-time propaganda'; they completely change the perception of the trooper within - making them believe that they are ""the good guys"". They never see the world for what it really is, but always through the digitally altered lens of the mindcontrol helmet, which they are completely unaware of. It can also make the user extremely susceptable to false memories being implanted - though getting rid of existing memories is still a bit too difficult.

The images shown to Resistance Troopers are deliberately made to be reminscant of the Rebels from years ago as they are universely revered as heroes. To one of these new Resistance fighters, the Republic is shown to be a comically evil all powerful ""First Order"", which they are fighting. Supreme Chanceller Snoke of the Republic is shown by Resistance Propaganda to be a decrepid Dark Force user of immense power, a terrifyingly evil enemy for all to rally against - in truth he has no Force powers at all and never leaves Coruscant. Enemy combatants' faces are always hidden by a helmet so as to dehumanise them, and their uniforms are altered to resemble the old Stormtrooper uniform (studies having shown that the old empire Stormtrooper uniform brought out the most hate amongst the troops - who ironically ARE basically the new Stormtroopers, though they don't know it). Senior Resistance members - old imperials who haven't given up and don't wear the mindcontrol helmets - are perceived through the lens of these helmets as old Rebel heroes. This is to boost morale and convince the troops they are fighting for good; even if these old heros might seem a little... off, hardly anyone will notice. This system is very effective, and even outlandish claims are believed quite easily. For example, in one case, a small Republic outpost on an ice planet is shown to be a gigantic super-weapon that threatens all life in the galaxy; despite everything about the situation being completely outlandish, all Resistance Troopers still believe the official story broadcasted through their helmets. 

This strategy does come with a few flaws of course. Recruits are lied to and told they fight for freedom, and this can come out at inoppurtune moments. It has been known for Resistance troopers to attempt to flee their post, or to become confused and start attacking their fellow comrades, or to question orders given to them by a superior officer - sometimes even leading to mutiny! In such cases, the Resistance trooper is to be shown imagery proving to them without a doubt that they are foolish and wrong. This usually works, although in extreme cases the Resistance trooper will of course be terminated.

Recently, the Resistance has managed to find an Old Jedi Temple on an island on a distant forgotten planet in the Outer Rim. With the help of the ancient texts found there, combined with their mindcontrol helmet technology, they have begun developing their new weapon: a Force-wielding trooper! This will no doubt be a huge asset to the Resistance - with the death of the Palpatine and Darth Vader, they had been without any kind of Force user for decades, and had thus been unable to properly confront the might of the Republic. Maz Kanata hand-picks the first test subject out for her skills and Force-potential - it's Rey of course. So far the program is going well. The dark side is, as Yoda famously said, quicker and easier to learn - as well as being more seductive, and having been captured at a young age, she already has most of the other training. One major concern in the project was that the ""Jedi"" might be able to sense their own helmet using the Force and hence realise they are being duped. So far this hasn't happened yet but the Resistance is putting numerous fail-safes in place to avoid such a disastrous scenario.

Meanwhile, Luke is training a new generation of Force-wielders. However, unlike the Jedi of Old, Luke does not set up his temple on Curuscant so as to avoid the politics that brought down the Jedi order. Instead, he builds it on the Planet Ren, a sparcely populated temperate world. To further differentiate it from the dead Jedi, they call themselves the Order of Ren - the successors to the Jedi. Resistance propaganda claims that they are all evil Dark Force wielders - to be feared and avoided at all costs. This could not be further from the truth, though lies are of course the routine for the Resistance.


____________

* The reason the First Order is so powerful while the Republic is replaced by a ""Resistance"" despite the Republic being the main power of the galaxy at the end of 6 is because we've actually got the two mixed up: the First Order is actually the Republic while the Resistance is the remnants of the Empire.

* Characters from the original trilogy acting out of character is because they're actually fake. (ex: Luke)

* The lack of backstories for all the important characters (or **believable** backstories in the case of Luke and Kylo) is because there aren't any: it's all Resistance propaganda. 

* Snoke is essentially completely fake - no scene with him in actually happened. It's all fake Resistance propagada to make their enemies look scary. That's why Snoke doesn't matter in the story.

* Finn's escape from the First Order is just his helmet malfunctioning which makes him suddenly realise that he's been conditioned from a young age an manipulated into serving the bad guys. But he gets caught, his helmet is fixed and now he's being manipulated into thinking that he's switched side from the First Order when actually he hasn't switched sides at all - he was Resistance all along. The fact that he doesn't seem all that affected by his stormtrooper background at any point in his story is a pretty big clue that something fishy is up - it's because he's still a stormtrooper!

* The reason they go travel to see Maz Kanata for no reason is because she's actually the secret leader of the Resistance. That's also why she continues giving oddly specific instructions to random resistance memebers who haven't even met her and also why she owns a lightsaber (however, it's not Anakin's lightsaber, it's just a normal one made by following the instructions from the Jedi Temple). The weird vision Rey recieved from the lightsaber was just her mindcontrol-helmet getting an update to reflect her new role as the Force-wielder of the Resistance.

* Rey is so powerful because she's actually using the dark side (the quick and easy route to power). She's also received standard Resistance Trooper training but was programmed to not notice it.

* Starkiller base is just a random Republic outpost and not at all a superweapon. No planets got destroyed by it: that was just a lie. This also explains why the superlaser was visible from completely different planets where it shouldn't have been - because it wasn't visible; that was all fake - that's a really big clue that our sense of sight is being messed with. It should not be visible! But we could see it! This also explains why no one else in the entire galaxy noticed it, or seemed to care about an entire solar system blowing up. And also why it was so easy to destroy, and why destroying it did not seem to cause any sort of setback for the First Order.

* The stupid map-to-Luke plot from 7 is just the mindcontrol-helmet's way of giving Rey instructions on where to go next. 

* The ridiculous situation known as the ""slow chase"" was actually the Resistance entering into negotiotions for their surrender; that's why the ships were close to each other without shooting each other - not the stupid excuse of ""going the exact same speed and no one smart enough to jump ahead to cut them off"" they gave in the films. And as honorable people, the Republic would definitely allow the Resistance time to surrender. Holdo was put in command after the admiral (disguised as Leia) started negotiations. Holdo lied to the crew about absolutely everything, as per standard procedure (although this time it doesn't work and the crew noticed something was off which is why there's a mutiny). The reason why none of the crew see the should-be-very-obvious-planet-and-sun out the window is because the mindcontrol helmets are making them not see it. That's another big clue that everyone's sense of sight is somehow being messed with. A nearby star is a very bright very big very obvious thing that no one should miss - unless of course their sense of sight is being messed with!

* The reason why the slow chase has the weird moral of ""obey authority, even if you think they're very wrong"" is because this is exactly the kind of authoritarian message the remnants of the Empire would want to send.

* When the negotiations were finished, fake-Leia came back; the helmets implanted the fake memory of Leia flying through space as a half-assed measure to try and explain the lies Holdo had come up with. 

* Fake-Leia then ordered Holdo to ""volunteer"" to be left behind as punishment for failing to keep the crew under control. Holdo did not hyperspace jump into the Republic fleet - that obviously doesn't work - but was instead captured and imprisoned by the Republic. But helmet-vision made sure to provide a spectacle for the Resistance Troopers to keep their morale up! This also explains why getting half their fleet exploded seemed to have absolutely no effect on the First Order's military capabilities - because it didn't actually happen.

* The reason the Jedi Temple got burned down and we got the strange moral of ""Burn books! Let the past die""- which seems more in place for an authoritarian regime... is because yet again, it IS given an authoritarian regime. Not given by Yoda.

* Rose's ""we don't win wars by fighting what we hate but by protecting what we love"" is not a stupid statement but is actually a clue that they shouldn't actually hate the First Order - the First Order are not their real enemies. What they should do is protect each other because they, at least, are on the same side. 

* Luke was shown to be a fake intangeable ghost.. and then the other version of Luke also disappeared in the same way. It makes it look like a Force Power - but it's a clue that Luke was fake all along, and that a lot of other characters are also just as fake as Luke is.

_______________

TLDR: The only way to fix the massive plot holes everywhere is to say that nothing in the sequels is canon and that it's all fake propaganda to manipulate the protagonists to be on the baddie's side. Also if you view the whole story as the protagonsists attempts to break free of the indoctrination they've been subjected to since a young age, the themes start to make a lot more sense. A bit.

2528,My Latest Star Wars RPG Character,"I've been putting up my character art, and here is the character I've just started playing in Star Wars 1st Edition. He's a Sand Person, but believes in using modern technology (otherwise he'd never have left Tatooine), so his robes and mask are a bit more post holocaust survivor than normal Sand People.

&amp;#x200B;

Gurur'Ukruk  
        Born among the People, (referred to by outsiders as Tusken Raiders or Sand People), Gurur'Ukruk was apprenticed to the Storyteller of his tribe, learning the stories of their ancestors and the devastation the sky people had brought to their cities and the lush paradise that was once Tatooine. He learnt that they had survived underground from the attack, and that their species had split into the Jawa's and the Ghorfa, eventually becoming the People. He grew to adulthood, hunting, bloodletting and killing a Dewback as part of his bloodrite, and was tasked in learning Basic as part of his training, learning the way of the offworlders, rather than the Huttese or Jawa that many Sand People learn.  
        He learnt as part of his education, that many of the People are not Ghorfa, but Humans, kidnapped as children and adopted into the tribes to build their numbers. As he studied Basic and the Humans, he became fascinated by their technology, and kept some that they captured from moisture farms, learning to use Datapads and the weapons of the offworlders in secret, fascinated by the technology and curious to on where it had come from. It was only when he the Storyteller passed away, and Gurur'Ukruk was set to replace him was this fact revealed to the tribe by one of the rivals for the position, and he was cast out from the tribe, his Bantha slaughtered in front of him, and he was left in the desert to die.  
        He trailed his tribe for months, surviving without problem in the harsh environment of the deep desert, and it was this exile that saved his life when the tribe attacked a settlement, only to discover that the local imperial garrison was already there searching for smugglers hiding their ships in the desert.  
        With his tribe massacred, and all ties severed, Gurur'Ukruk set off for Mos Eisley, trading his property for passage off world. He has travelled the Galaxy since, curious about the variety of species and worlds out there.  
        He remains convinced that The People are purified by the desert, and that the Galactic Civil war is evidence that the Off-Worlders are violent and destructive, and therefore inferior to The People, and in need of guidance, and he has joined the Rebellion to try to help end this war and the destruction it brings to the innocent and weak.  
        He still wears robes and breathmask, upgrading to non-tusken versions, and no longer keeps to the religious rules on never revealing skin except during marriage and childbirth. Under his robes and mask, he appears to be human, but his skin is blistered and scarred by the desert life he once led, and the constant rubbing of his garments.

2532,I have an idea for what I think could be the perfect replacement for the last Jedi (warning it’s very long),"I’m not gonna say my opinion on the movie because that isn’t what this is about, this is about how much better it could have been (but I doubt Disney would allow this)

My version of the last Jedi would focus much more heavily on Rey and kylo, spending the majority of the film looking at Rey training with Luke, while having telepathic conversations with kylo without meaning to.
There would be a greater emphasis on the relationship between Rey and kylo and more importantly on their different beliefs and views on how the force should be used

This would change Rey’s experience in the force cage as well, possibly showing and image of her and kylo when she asks who her parents are

It would all build up to kylo convincing Rey to go to him and would climax at the sequence in snokes quarters ending in Rey accepting kylos offer to join him not as sith or as Jedi but as a new order of force users that find balance between the light and the dark

I think this would be a much stronger story than any created post original trilogy (not including legends content) because it would focus more on being an analysis of what we as humans perceive as right or wrong and a study of why you should understand all points of view before coming to a concrete conclusion by having rey and kylo slowly grow to understand eachother throughout the movie ending in them finding true balance in the force by embracing both the light and the dark",StarWars,1541167259,mysteryman151,13,1,True,2018-11-02

 I thought I understood Disney's decision when buying the franchise to eliminate the extended universe. I thought they wanted to build their own world but instead all of their Star Wars stories have been in the ""Skywalker Era"". I believe this has diminished and hurt the series going forward. The Skywalker Era has many fans of all ages and the series means so much to so many different generations. I believe a clean slate of stories would do the franchise wonders and bring the fan base together. I want to see a Old Republic style the series. All that I am seeing is TV shows and movies set in the time frame that we know. I believe that Last Jedi was a risk that for many didn't pay off. I think they took the risk in the wrong spot ( I love The Last Jedi) but I also understand the problems people have with it and what it did to their Hero. I think that a story like The Last Jedi would have been better told in the Old Republic timeline or better yet a timeline with all new characters and creatures. 

I would love to know what you all think about the fact that they eliminated the Old Canon ( some of which had the best star wars stories) and replaced it with nothing except movies and TV shows only in the Skywalker Era. Also what are some of your favorite non Canon star wars stories they could adapt.

2536,A couple things I noticed while rewatching ROTJ,"During the scene where Vader takes off his helmet, you can hear blaster fire and explosions in the background. The explosions are probably from the space battle, but the blaster fire sounds an awful lot like an E-11 (the stromtrooper's main weapon) so I don't know what's going on there since there's no official canon of rebels being onboard the DS2. I remember hearing this before, but I never noticed it was an E-11.

Also during the scene where Luke is burning Vader's body, a brief part of the music sounds a lot like the funeral music in ROTS, which is such a cool little detail John Williams threw in there (the man's a genius).

2539,"How the next anthology film could feature Kenobi and Fett, and also be a sequel to Solo","I'd love to see a Kenobi movie with Crimson Dawn and Jabba's organization up to no good in the midst of a turf war, killing innocents and riling up the Sand People. Old Ben takes a break from chilling with Qui-Gon's Force ghost to investigate when someone close to Luke turns up dead from a Kaminoan dart--enter Boba Fett. Fett learns Kenobi is alive and wants to take him out, both out of hatred for the Jedi and for the Imperial reward for such a bounty. When Fett and Kenobi get caught up in a Crimson Dawn firefight, Ben saves Boba.

Han and Chewie and Qi'ra could all be minor characters, with Chewie and Ben even meeting (as they seem familiar with each other in a New Hope). I think Ben's internal conflict would be with his guilt over Anakin and the despair over losing the Jedi and the Republic. This and the external conflict would culminate in the Kenobi-Maul fight from Rebels.

Jabba is thrilled to have eliminated Crimson Dawn, until a star destroyer drops out hyperspace and Han drops the expensive shipment Jabba had entrusted him with. A shuttle lands from the destroyer carrying an inquisitor who finds Maul's ashen remains and melted lightsaber on a funeral pyre, while Kenobi slips back into the Jundaland Wastes. Boba Fett aims his sniper rifle from the concealed position where he watched the lightsaber fight, but hesitates to fire on the Jedi who saved his life. His comm beeps, and he gets a new contract offer from Jabba: Han Solo, dead or alive.

2543,Describe the Star Wars Gam You Want.,"I posted this in /gaming as well. 

Let me preface this by saying don't cram everything you could possibly conceive into one game which effectively turns it into five different games in one. For example, a star wars RPG with pod racing fleshed out as much as a stand alone pod racing game would have (that example might be reasonable, but you get the idea). I'm hoping we can take the most popular ones and create petitions which will hopefully reach really high levels considering how many subs this thread has and catch the attention of EA, (or hopefully someone else if the license exclusivity is removed). So having a game have everything in it would be ridiculously expensive and make it unlikely to happen, which is why I place that restriction on the game.

I want a star wars game with the combat depth of For Honor. You'd actually be able to block and parry and what not with that system. You would also be able to create your own fighter though.

1. You'd choose your lightsaber: single, double, duel wield, shorter lightsaber, even a lightsaber whip, which is a real thing. Each lightsaber type has a couple of fighting styles to choose from, so not everyone fights identical just because they are both using the same lightsaber style.
2. There would be a significant amount of force powers to choose from as well. I'd like them to be more frequent than For Honor thumbpad abilities but not too much. IDK experimentation would be required to get a good amount. I'm looking at the power trees of the old KOTOR series and see a lot of good unconventional ones such as Stasis, Health Drain, Force Drain, Terror, Battle Meditation, ect...

OBI-WAN: Training?

YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

OBI-WAN: Who?

YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.

OBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?

YODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.


Now, you need to become “one with the force” in order go to the netherworld. And it’s established that there is training in order to do this. 

Is it possible that you could, in your training, transfer to that other side for brief moments when you become one with the force?

Is it possible that Yoda, Obi Wan and Qui-Gon achieved this at times during their training to become force ghosts. What if Luke accidentally achieved this at the end of TLJ?

2555,What if - Disney had bought Lucasfilm in 1995 instead,"As much as I enjoy the sequel trilogy so far, there are certainly some quite reasonable complaints that they are disappointed in the screen time and focus on the older characters and even on a couple of the newer ones, particularly Poe but also Finn in TLJ.

In our timeline Disney bought Lucasfilm in late 2012, 7 years after the prequels.

Disney at the time thought that the OT actors were getting on and knew they needed to focus and introduce new younger characters to take the saga forward whilst also allowing each of the OT characters to have 1 movie each into which to shine.

Let’s now play a game of what if. What if Disney had bought Lucasfilm in 1995 instead of 2012.

I don’t think they would have made the PT straight away. 

I think in relaunching Star Wars they would have made the sequel trilogy then. With that trilogy coming out 15/16 years after the original trilogy.

That ST would have still had the OT characters as the main characters but across the films closer to 60/40 screen time with the next generation, Ben Solo and pupils of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (in his 40s) rather than 60s. 
I suspect the ST would have then ended with the death of Han Solo and perhaps even the fall of Ben Solo. 

This would have of course provided more satisfaction to seeing our favourite characters back in action together before whilst still in their prime. 

After the ST you could then have gone back to the PT (in this timeline mid to late 2000s), followed by Eps 10-12 which is what we would be seeing the end of now. Eps 10-12 firmly focused on the new generation with Leia and Luke in supporting roles.

2556,What's an obscure/random thing you like about Star Wars?,"I could name a million but one that comes to mind is that the galaxy is portrayed in such a way that demonstrates how wealth/technology follows the same uneven distribution as our own world. Civilization is capable of making a Death Star, but there are still many (if not most) living in primitive villages with only limited access to the technology that exists.

Another thing is the fantasy element (that's right, not sci fi). And that is reflected by the use of imagery that is reminiscent of medieval fantasy like LOTR. I think this is one thing that I really appreciate about the sequel trilogy (Maz's castle and Kylo Ren's claymore-like lightsaber come to mind).",StarWars,1541229389,RvnclawPotionsMaster,29,1,True,2018-11-03
2557,On the cancellation of Boba Fett,"So it's be been announced that the Boba Fett film was cancelled, and with it comes a reduction in the number of ""anthology"" films. The reason is of course the commercial failure of Solo, which has been attributed to franchise fatigue ""too much too fast"" which, frankly, I don't believe. Disney has been able to put out two MCU films a year for the last decade and viewing figures, and profits, have certainly not dwindled.

I think the real reasons people didn't go to see it were:

1. It came out 6 months after The Last Jedi, probably the most devisive film of the series; half the people loved it, the other half *hated* it. I don't want to go into why people did and didn't like it, but a lot of people were still very angry about TLJ when Solo came out, and refused to see it.

2. Han Solo isn't the character everyone wanted to see. His background was never really in that much question; in A New Hope we met a random smuggler who's out for himself and then had a change of heart and helped save the day. That *was* his origin story.

3. The casting of Alden Ehrenreich. When the trailers came out, many people were angry about his casting since he doesn't look much like a young Harrison Ford, especially when we knew Anthony Ingruber was in the running. Many people didn't give him a chance.

I nearly didn't go to see Solo (and some of my Star Wars fan friends still haven't seen it), mostly for reason 2, partly for reason 1. I went in with low expectations, and came away very pleasantly surprised. After about 5 minutes I stopped noticing that Alden wasn't Harrison and enjoyed the film. It's not the best in the series, but it's a good fun standalone adventure (with, I think, a nice little tie-in for future films with different characters), Donald Glover was the perfect Lando and stole basically any scene he was in, and all the cringey lines from the trailer were either removed or in a different context to the one I assumed, making them not cringey.

It makes me sad that this good film was never given the chance it deserved, failed as a result, and therefore there will be fewer future anthology films for us to enjoy. I think Disney still has a lot to gain from anthology films, perhaps not centred on the original characters, but building the world around them (except an Obi-Wan film with Ewan McGregor, we need that film).

**Republic Cruiser raid!**

We efficiently disabled the Republic cruiser. I was on the Bridge looking over the Cruiser like a master looking over his beaten and whipped slave. I told my guard company to follow me to the boarding tube. Where we will storm the ship and send a haunting message to the Republic. I am going down in the elevator, the troops locking and clicking their guns, getting prepared, getting ready to murder! The elevator opens as an Officer is standing by telling me that the boarding tube is about to launch. I just casually reply with a “Thank you” as I see sweat drip from his forehead. The officer walks away down the opposite corridor with his gloved hands shaking like he has been shell shocked. I tell my secondary Tiger Company to go and secure a beachhead from inside the hangar while my team boards them directly. I contact the bridge and tell them have they secured a secure and escorted route to the hangar. Admiral Cyn replies with a firm yes. I order the Lieutenant in charge of securing that beachhead to begin his assault. I stand ready for the boarding tube to open. I tell the Admiral to open the tube. The door opens steam floods the boarding tube while my troops follow behind me in double file. We walk quickly across the metal framed floor. You could hear the clank of the boots against the floor. I tell them to open the door to the enemy cruiser. The steam from the boarding tube intoxicates the air I see nothing for a second then I see shadows. I emerge from the mist. Taking out my lightsaber I activate it as the deep blood red light infects the steam having a red tint. One of the soldiers just shoots at me I deflect it right back into his face with a heavy swing. The other 4 troopers just start to unleash blaster bolts as fast as they can shoot their guns. As I deliberately just don’t deflect them into the soldiers just scorching the roof, walls and floor with scorch marks and lightsaber cuts. I just casually carve up the hallway like having a blank canvas painting a battlefield. I move closer to the enemies as one or two try to back up. I see my window of opportunity. I pull my hand out and force grab two of their guns as the other two just slowly back away. I jam my lightsaber through one of the soldier’s throat as he just holds his red hot throat as I grab my lightsaber in reverse and spinning and cutting the soldiers head clean off. I force freeze the other helpless soldier to the wall as I move closer to him. My troops rush behind me single file. The troop’s quickly marching going to execute everyone in their path. I draw my lightsaber close to his throat as he desperately says “Mercy! Mercy!” I just reply with a very questionable tone “Mercy?” I just run my lightsaber right across his neck and then dropping him to the floor. I shout at my troops saying “Find him!” The all quickly march by as I proceed to hear screaming and gun fire.

I am walking down a hallway. Where my troops have just completely scorched the corridors bodies, blaster marks everywhere. I just stop at a junction where it splits off 2 corridors. I just stare at the bodies, the civilian bodies. I turn to see a Republic Heavy Trooper just tackle me from the side. Grabbing me and picking me up by the stomach. Then he just chucks me into a glass table. The glass smashes into pieces as I just get covered in little shards of glass. I roll on the floor a few times before I smack my back against the wall. I breathe deeply. It is almost like time slows down like each second is a minute. I hear the trooper’s footsteps. I hear his masked breathing over the covering of his helmet. I stand up as I look at him. I Wait. I wait for him to make the move. He doesn’t he stands still like a deactivated droid. I grab my lightsaber with my left hand as he lunges forward. He grabs me by the throat and the left wrist. He squeezes my wrist. I eventually dropping the lightsaber as he just let’s go of my hand. I finally realise what it’s like to be in my victim’s position. People Scramble for air like finding starship components in the largest junk pile imaginable. I lift my leg up against the wall. I just push against the wall as hard as I can. He quickly falls over releasing me. I stand up ready to beat him to death. He stands up slowly as the juggernaut just starts to stand over me like a monument. He thrusts a right hook as I just duck and upper cut him. I punch him in the helmet again and again. I only push him back not hurting him much. I finally knock off his mask revealing a shell shocked, scarred face. I can see it in his eyes. He has a grudge. Is it with me? Or is it with people I am associated with? I ask him. What his problem was. His problem was that his wife was a soldier as well and he saw her die by a Sith cutting her down. As for one of his kids one joined the Jedi Temple when it was first attacked by Darth Malgus. He was brutally slaughtered in the raid. The other one supposedly joined the Sith order and never seen again by his records. He really had it in his eyes. The determination in his eyes to go all the way through with it to get what he wants. I finally muster the concentration to channel my anger as I finally get his spine like it is literally in my hands. I just quickly twist it as fast as possible. His head just twitches up right as far as it can go. His ragdoll body just pulls itself to the floor, slumped down against the wall like a worthless drunk alien.  I kneel down next to his body. As I hear a voice screaming. I look round his body for the source. I finally find it, it is a communicator device. I listen as a female Twi’lek voice screams out that she needs help at the engine room. I ask the Admiral to patch me through to the squad near the Engine room. I ask Sergeant what is the problem at the engine room? He tells me that they have been cut off from the hangar. I quickly run down the hallway. I order the Admiral to upload the schematics of the ship to my wrist communicator. It projects the corridors and tells me where I need to go. I am about to meet up with the squad that are trapped between Republic Forces. I finally meet up with them as they are dug in behind walls and barriers anything they can find as they are being slowly annihilated. I pull out my lightsaber and have it by my side as a soldier fires right towards me. I drag me left arm up from it’s low position. I pull my lightsaber down to shoulder height as my lightsaber and blaster bolt meet perfectly. The bolt just hits his body as steam emerges from his body as it just falls down. I sense another blaster bolt quickly approaching me I hold out my black gloved hand as the bolt just freezes mid flight. I just stare at the soldier showing nothing but rage in my eyes. I pull my right arm back a bit and then just thrust it forward as the bolt just catapults right into his eye as death instantly greets him as the upper part of his body just collapses onto the box in front of him. A Republic Trooper next to the dead body just pulls the corpse off the box and reaches behind his back and pulls out a Vibroblade. A feeble weapon used by non-force users to try and combat Jedi and Sith. He sprints at me while I just walk casually having complete confidence in myself. He jumps up bringing his Vibroblade up high. I grab my lightsaber with two hands and put my lightsaber on it’s side as it blocks. I push my lightsaber as it knocks him back. I spin round holding my lightsaber close to me as I deeply cut the Soldier’s knee as he just goes down on one knee. I hold my lightsaber high above my left shoulder as I strike against his blade. I force grab his entire body with my right hand. I quickly just plunge my lightsaber into his chest as I hold him up high. I deactivate my lightsaber and his body just falls on his knees and he just falls to the side. I look down at his body as I just casually look at the stab that just went straight through his body. I fall back behind cover as I can finally ask the Sergeant what’s going on. He said that our numbers got thin way to quickly. I call out on my wrist communicator to all the open Imperial channels that I need Riot Troopers on my position immediately. As the corridor that I came from I just see sixteen Riot Troopers marching quickly shields up. I shout at them I need eight troopers on each side! They just separate into the two groups as the remaining Rifle Troopers just get behind them. The Riot Troopers just slam their shields on the ground. I just scream at both groups to advance! They both start to push out with the Rifle troopers doing what they can to thin the numbers. I look to see the Republic Officer taking cover. The Twi’lek officer I heard of the communicator. I leap in front of the group as the last two Troopers. They all of a sudden start firing on me. I quickly approach one of them as I just cut him all the way down his body. The last one I stride forwards towards the other trooper as I just put my lightsaber away and punch his helmet as he is disoriented I hold him in a head lock diagonally in-front of me I snap his neck by just throwing him slightly on his side as he just spins in the air before his armour just crack against the friction him gained by hitting the floor. I start to force choke the Twi’lek officer as I slowly just bring her towards me. I ask one of the Riot Troopers to handcuff her and send her to the Detention block on my ship and await further instructions. One of the Troopers approaches us and claps her in cuffs. He throws her into the crowd of troopers where they form a defensive formation. I grab the Soldier by the upper arm and tell him to keep an eye on her and make sure she gets to the cells. The trooper replies with a “Understood sir!” I tell the remaining troops to wait for reinforcements and supplies from the ship. I walk off towards the elevator to go to the ship bridge.

As I stand among littered corpses there is an announcement from the ship comms being projected in every hallway and room. A trooper patched through and said “To all surviving Republic Troopers and citizens lay down your arms and this won’t get any uglier. You must proceed to the Bridge all of you otherwise you are kill on sight for the Sith. Also there is a Senator on board if you are aware of it or not. They must also proceed to the Bridge and we might spare you. ” I make my way towards the bridge. Finally with the corridors and rooms clear of enemies that were still standing. I enter the elevator I just lean against the walls wonder why they don’t have music? I know the Jedi and the Republic are boring but god this is depressing. The elevator opens as 4 Sith Troopers stand either side of me standing at attention. I walk along past the tattered Republic Flags that lay on the walls. It never gets old seeing the Republic weep for the loved ones, burn in defeat and retreat in fear. I see a Technician group just sealing up the door to the escape pods. I walk by a Imperial Trooper beat up a helpless civilian. I see the connection in those strikes. I feel the pain. I feel the fear and the hopelessness of life. I see 2 squads of Troopers just put away their guns and get out there pair of handcuffs to subdue all the civilians and troopers send them away to some slave pit hopefully. I walk down the steps as more technicians get to work on the Republic computers. The main Bridge computers and the field commander are at the front of the bridge talking to the Troopers. I ask him how many civilians and troopers we have in the bridge. He said about 150 with more arriving. I also ask him what about the Senator where is he? He said we haven’t found him yet but we are doing a Heat Signature. I tell him to turn off the reactor and tell our ship to grapple the ship so we don’t drift off. I look back at the rest of the bridge. Seeing the Troops tear down and light the Republic Banners on fire it does bring a sense of satisfaction to it. Seeing all those civilians and troops clapped in irons and escorted by squads does make me thrilled. I address all the squads to send the prisoners onto the ship but send some prisoners to Korriban where Sith can enjoy some torture with them and it’s also the practised. The all begin to march off into the elevator and down to the boarding tube. I walk out of the bridge as I head back to the boarding tube. My wrist com lights up constantly like a busy street on Coruscant. I activate it as the Bridge Officer says that there is a unusually large squad heading from the Reactor to the Hangar. I ask him if he has any squads in those near corridors and he tells me that we have no squads near. I tell him to order the Squad stationed there to be prepared for an attack. I sprint down the hallways with corpses piled up in every room every corridor. A squad marches past me as I suddenly stop and tell them to follow me. I activate my wrist com and order the Admiral to deploy the Sith MK-1 War Droids. The blast door opens as we see the Imperial Troopers guarding the blast door to the Hangar. I ask the Trooper to let me and that I need to see the hangar. He presses the panel as the blast door opens. I walk into the massive, tall room. I see Troopers loading something onto the Shuttle. I ask one of the troopers what they are doing. The blast door behind me suddenly closes and the trooper suddenly pulls out his rifle off his back and starts shooting at me and the other two guards with me. I yell at my two soldiers to find cover. They roll forward into cover. I quickly pull my lightsaber off the belt and activate it and deflect the blaster bolt off onto the floor. I see that off to my right is a squad of Imperial troopers covering this man dressed in fancy clothing as I realise it’s the Senator. Across to the other side of the Hangar the Sith War Droids emerge with another squad of Imperials as they open fire on the fake imperials. I sprint towards the circle of people protecting the Senator as I leap and hold the lightsaber over the left side of my head. I get so close, meters away from the cluster of people as one of the Imperial’s holds his hand out and I go flying back into the metal wall. I land on the floor head and dropping my lightsaber on the ground. I walk breathing heavily with my shattered mask. I take of my mask off coughing like I have a disease. I get on my knees as I pull my hood down. I see the shuttle take off as I just scream at them. I grab my lightsaber as I stand up as I breath deeply in absolute anger. The troops rush in securing the hangar. I press my wrist communicator and tell the Admiral to fire on the shuttle. An Imperial Trooper walks up to me and asks what we do now. In a fit of anger I yell at him “I am gonna tell you what you need to do! Die!” I grab him by the throat as he squirms like a fish. He is trying to grab every bit of air. I hear a snap and his body just turns motionless. I just let go of the body, grab my mask and walk towards the boarding tube as the remaining troops and War Droids follow behind me.

Abrams: When Rian [Johnson], who I admire enormously and adore, came on board, we met and talked with him about all the things we were working on and playing with, and he as a spectacular writer and director has taken those things and has written an amazing script that I think will be an incredible next chapter, some of which incorporating things we were thinking of and other things are things we could never of dreamed of.

Does Rian read your script and maybe suggest some changes or additions for things he maybe wants to seed early for his film?

J.J. Abrams: There were a handful of things we talked about that were going to be helpful to him. Some were very easy to do, and some things were things that I didn’t want to do for other reasons, but I tried to be as accommodating as I could. And its so cool to see what happens next in a way that only someone as talented as Rian could do.

https://www.slashfilm.com/jj-abrams-interview-star-wars-the-force-awakens/

One of the changes that Johnson asked to Abrams:

""Johnson already had a to-do list for the Force once it awakened, and he was involved early enough to know exactly where Abrams and co-screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan were taking things. But when he saw the planned ending — that silent scene of Rey returning an exiled Luke Skywalker’s first lightsaber to him — he had a concern about who was accompanying her on that journey.

His request will end up returning a long-beloved Star Wars figure to the center of the action: R2-D2.

“Yes … The big [favor] was, I asked if R2 could come with Rey, and if BB-8 could stay behind with the Resistance,” Johnson says. “Originally it was BB-8 who went with Rey, which makes sense for the story in a way. But I asked, ‘Can you do me this solid and switch the droids?’”

2571,Why Rey is such a boring character ?,"She is such a Mary Sue that she might as well have been written by Chris Chan.
She is a character so focused on subverting the archetype of the damsel in distress that she fucks up every other aspect.
She is not a badass warrior, not an inspiring leader, she is not spurred by fate or prophecy, she is not the daughter of a powerful force user.
Why is she suddenly so good at fighting with the light saber and powerful in the force ?

And she could’ve been the best character ever, a more serious, down to earth and even brutal version of Luke. 
I mean her lifestyle seems simple and easy enough, gather shit, well said shit, buy food.
She lives in a fucking desert, she should’ve been like a fremen fighter living in the Wastes, riding that pen drive of hers, killing roving bands of raiders to protect her people. She would be the type of person that society needs in order to win the peace but cannot permit to stay to enjoy it.
Over time she would join the Resistance, slowly climb up the ranks, help them to defeat the first order and then... leave.
She could not stay with them, she is just too evil to be good and too good to be evil, she belongs to the wild frontier.  
Her transition to a “good person” to a Jedi would have been awesome, she would have to fight that urge to leave, to rebel, she would have therm taught by an older, bitter and more experienced Luke who would’ve recognized her as a pupil and spend a few years teaching her.

- It was a copy of Episode IV with yet another Death Star.
- Power Rangers with Scotch accent. Kanjiclub or whatever they're called.
- Snoke is looking like a monster just to show he's evil.

Problems with Episode VIII:
- Holdo and Rose characters were bad.
- Leia surviving scene.

I understand if people don’t like the sequels or anthology films, but why hate. Fans in the Marvel community also have movies they don’t like, like Thor Dark World or Iron Man 2, but they don’t stray into hate. MCU fans still supported the franchise and ended up getting Iron Man 3 and Thor Ragnorak, which are loved by those fans. Why say no to more movies? I truly don’t understand. I don’t buy the “I don’t trust Disney” argument, because the movies are still being made by talented people, and in some cases, by the same people who made the original movies (like Lawrence Kasden). Plus, Disney has made some of the most cherished and loved films in history, not to mention the MCU.

2580,why i think that star wars games should either return or focus on single-player games (discussion),"star wars' universe is great, amazing fun and most importantly huge, and diverse! that being said the universe of star wars started and (in my opinion) does best when its used to tell a story 

multiplayer games on the other hand, focus on competitive play, one team of players against another (or different game modes of PvP, lets not start nitpicking about this)

&amp;#x200B;

so my point is, whenever someone consumes star wars media, be it films, tv shows, games, books or comics, he or she is following the main character, following a story and a specific character or set of characters. now, multiplayer games not having a story is old news and star wars can and does do well in the realm of player vs player video games but (and i think this is the important part, more than the story argument since this is the real ''issue'' so to speak) star wars is first and foremost a predefined universe with its own set of rules, for this reason i think it doesn't work with multiplayer games, we all can agree than trained force-users are stronger than the average Joe in the SW universe and we all know that some weapons are stronger than others, some alien species are better than humans in one way or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

my point is that a SW MP game will never feel as good or as live as a SP game for example since you cant balance it to be both fun for both sides and believable at the same time (as in true to the universe created by George Lucas &amp; Disney)

&amp;#x200B;

2603,Really X-wing was 'super' superior then Tie Figher?,"&amp;#x200B;

[\(Sorry for my bad english\)](https://i.redd.it/wyf5t01a29w11.jpg)

Well in star wars, many people said that X-wing(T-65) is superior and TieFighter(standard) is inferior.

And I know Lucas get motive of TieFighter from the Japanese A6M fighter during the pacific war.

If TieFighter was really slow and X-wing was extremely fast. I can understand why X-wing was superior. It's same as fast American Figher(F6F, P-51D, P-38..) slaughtered the slow japanese figher.

But Tie Fighter and X-wing have same speed and same maneuverability. It means if X-wing have a Tiefighter on his tail, X-wing can't run away. cuz speed is actaully same.

Some people said 'X-wing have shield and Hyper drive.' But first, X-wing(T-65) don't have turret. So if TieFighter attack X-wing from back. X-wing don't have anything to attack TieFighter.  And it seems shield is not a infinite one.. It has limitation. And second... X-wing have Hyperdrive, but let's think you are Rebel and have some mission against Empire. But soon you are in trouble with TieFighter. So you used your Hyperdrive and run away from the TieFighter on your tail. 

Happy end! but mission failed and you abandoned all your rebel friends. And all X-wing had ran away with their hyperdrive, the leftover rebel fleet just slaughtered by Empire. You can 'survive' but You can't 'win'.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/e17fiein59w11.gif

Or Maybe X-wing can use Hyperdrive infinitely so they can teleport to Tiefigher's tail? like this picture?

&amp;#x200B;

So my conclusion is X-wing is quite superior then TieFighter. It depends on pilot.

But almost every battle. X-wing will be outnumbered by TieFigher. And they don't have supreme advantage the TieFighter. cuz their speed and maneuverability are 'same'.

If X-wing have more speed. TieFighter pilot will yell ""He is so fast I can't catch him!"" or X-wing have more maneuverability, they will yell ""I can't catch his tail! I'm losing in turn fight!""

But It looks X-wing don't have both.",StarWars,1541310794,sso02147,6,1,True,2018-11-04

2618,What can the return of The Clone Wars do to make Anakin Skywalker’s fall more tragic?,"Here are some of my own thoughts:

It must be one of the main priorities. I don't have huge interest in Asajj Ventress, droid adventures or pirates vs bounty hunters – we’ve seen plenty of them already, and moreover, they are characters that can fit anywhere in the SW timeline. The life and times of Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padmé, on the other hand, do not have this luxury. By the time the Clone War came to an end these were people who were either dead or beyond recognition.

A lot of fans (though not me) were disappointed by what they felt to be a lack of heroism in Anakin’s character, particularly during Episode II. It was a film that went out of its way to suggest “this guy is definitely turning to the dark side, there is nothing you can do about it”, which is fine - nobody turns evil in a heartbeat - but it can make for a very dull narrative. A tragedy done right requires an audience to be invested in its protagonist, to believe alternative outcomes might exist (even if only to be glimpsed at), or else it becomes utter fatalism. We need to be able to suspend our disbelief, just as we do with the concept of The Force.

To achieve this, I think it’s crucial that, within reason, his character be made as sympathetic as possible. Without his positive qualities being brought out, significant lines like Padmé’s “There’s still good in him” or Luke’s refusal to kill Vader in RotJ fall flat on their faces. We need to be shown the good, it is simply not enough to tell. With the introduction of Ahsoka in TCW, a whole new light was shone on him – one that revealed an inspiring teacher, who was prepared to listen to the feedback of his apprentice and even overturn decisions in her favour. This is the mark of a good man, but I think there is room for more in the revival of our beloved animation.

One idea might be for Anakin to come to the rescue of the Jedi Council. Perhaps he uncovers a plot against them, manages to hold it off, yet receives little acknowledgement from Yoda and Mace Windu. Or the Jedi end up thanking somebody else instead, and he's left frustrated over why this has happened.

I would dearly love to see an arc of Anakin and Obi-Wan (no other Jedi to distract us), where the former bails out the latter. This would stress their brotherhood, something we didn't see much of in the last 2 seasons. The first act of RotS shows their relationship at an all time time, with terrific banter during the Battle of Coruscant, so if The Clone Wars is to line up with this event, it's imperative we see more of this dynamic. James Arnold Taylor and Matt Lantor have shown themselves to be well equipped to convey wit and sarcasm.

It was nice to see the Anakin-Padmé relationship return in Season 6 after an absence, but I think we need to see something a bit more uplifting as we did in earlier seasons or in RotS up to Mustafar. This is a couple about to have a child, they should be madly in love, even if it is a secret. It would really benefit the tragedy if Anakin were to announce to her his intention to leave the Order at the end of the Clone War. Perhaps a dinner scene where they discuss the toll of the war on their lives.

TL;DR
Show us more of the Anakin-Obi-Wan banter we had in the early parts of RotS. Do not get hung up on Anakin's looming fall, it's obvious. Bring more emotional depth to the Anakin-Padmé relationship.

Just a interesting connection I saw when I was reading the comic. 

So for those that don't know a Ooglith Masquer is a bioengineered organism that attaches itself to the pores of a sentient being and changes how they look. However while they could be used over and over they could only take on (or be programmed with) one appearance. You also needed different Masquer's for different species such as Human, Duros, and Ssi-Ruuv. Eventually the Wriaths are able to back engineer their own brand that can look like certain people. 

In Dr. Aphra we are introduced to another bio-engineered creature called a Pluripleq http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pluripleq . It is a sort of octopus like creature that works in some way similar to a changeling. It would make sense if it enveloped its host entirely in its body but judging by the picture it just goes over the wearers head. 

This creature can upon command of the user transform into any humanoid alien instantly and can transform into more than a single different one (IE not limited to one species like the Masquer).

Originals: The Effects in Return of the Jedi don’t always hold up. Especially the jabba’s palace scene where the outlines around the characters are very noticeable.

Sequels: The over-usage of quips and humor. Humor in Star Wars is always been there, but it seemed to marvel-esque at times. 

Star Wars stories: Rogue One was an orgy of fan service (which is fine by me but boy was there a lot of it).

I'm not super deep into Star Wars so I don't know all the characters, so I was hoping some of you true fans would be able to help me figure out some of them.

**Notes/Details**

\- They all seem to be made by Hasbro (Hasbro name is usually on the bottom of the feet, and occasionally on another part of the toy

\- They all have moving joints

\- The little blue/gray/yellow droid (don't know the name) has a little string that comes out of the back that you can pull out, and it goes back into the body when you twist the head)

\- The droideka has a lever on the back to swing its arms, and it looks like it's supposed to have some type of bullet that goes in the hands and shoots out (I can see springs on the inside)

\- Jango Fett's jetpack is removable - it looks like a missile can also go in the jetpack and be launched out (springs on the inside)

\- Boba Fett's missile on his jetpack can be pressed down to make his arms move back and forth

\- The fighter ship is the most peculiar and interesting one of them all. I cannot for the life of me figure out what model it is. The additional wings on the end can come out, and the little droid seems to be able to fit in the opening on the front left of the ship. It also has adjustable feet.

2663,Lets Give Rian Johnson some Respekt,"Whatever your opinion of TLJ, I think some people have spewed a\\some misguided opinions about Rian.  
He did NOT purposely reject or intentionally try to subvert all expectations for the sake of it. In fact, one of the conceits of the movie was to say that the old/mythology need to be revered again, but also need an updated balance with the current times. 

Also a reminder that he work and finished the script DURING THE FILMING of the Force Awakens. He was literally going off of daily's from the film and only went off the script, without any of the finished production or much less the fan reactions. 

Lets pretend that this is still before TLJ and I would've told you these things about Rian, a director of the most mainstream IP in the universe:

\- a fan of both the OT and THE Prequels, and even watched the Clone Wars, something that even some ""hardcore"" fans didnt even bother to watch until later on. 

\- particularly payed attention to the Mortis Arc, again, another obscure piece of Star Wars story telling in the grand scheme of things.

\- Was going to tie the story conceit of the Prequels with the OT and ST. Even many cinematic choices and musical spotting choices were going to all of the trilogies together.

\- an overall self professed geek of things like animes that Filoni has also cited a part of his influences

\- Played Knights of the Old Republic series when it first came out

\- The way he talks about he looks at Star Wars, what makes Star Wars, storytelling/film influences, is eerily similar to how I've heard Filoni talked 

\- Worked top down with all creators from the Story group down to the authors writing tie in novels to help establish some neat little continuity between these various mediums. On the other hand, it has been noted that JJ Abrams would go off and kept things under wrap within his own production company, even away from Lucasfilm, much less collaborate with other creators (hence why the Force Awakens novel was considered one of the weakest novel adaptations to date). Nothing against JJ, and I respect his work, but it is clear that JJ was nowhere near the collaborator Rian had been.

\- even though he admitted he read the Expanded Universe, was willing to adapt some EU concepts into the script

\- would publicly cite Filoni as an important figure during his story development, even publicly endorses him for some live action responsibilities!!

\- liked Prequel/SequelMemes posts on Tumblr/Twitter

The guy has proven to be a die hard fan, but much more than that, an intelligent dude that understands that JUST understanding Star Wars facts and myths is enough to make an enduring Star Wars story, you cant be dogmatic about Star Wars can be. It is after all, an allegory. He has, to much more of an extent than other director so far, been a kind and generous collaborator.  

I honestly can't wait for this trilogy, and a chance to work away from the pressures and constraints of the Skywalker trilogy.

2666,Episode 9 and what it means for the Franchise,"I am a longtime fan that was absolutely in love with every part of the Star Wars universe. I loved the OT, loved the PT, and TFA alike. I also thoroughly enjoyed Rogue One... and after the boycott, Solo (when i finally rented it at Redbox ;). and honestly, I hated the Last Jedi. But rewatched it may times, i have.. to gain some sort of acceptance of its existence, and now am hopeful to see JJ write something unbelievable to make it a genius plot instead of the worst SW movie ever made. I'm thinking:

1.  if he were to explain the Snoke is a dark entity the possesses a host and controls it (maybe like the ""ghost"" or essence of Plagueis) and that body that was cut in half by Ren was either a ""rotting"" clone or a possessed humanoid being. 
2. Then bring him back by having him go after Leia and then defeat Kylo when he comes to save her, and Kylo narrowly escaping Snoke/Plageuis due to Leia sacrifcing herself to save her son
3. Kylo then panics, on the run from Snoke. He goes to recruit Rey to help him, to which she turns and tells him to save himself.
4. Then have force ghost Luke intervene in an appearance to Rey and guide her to help Kylo. Once she does Luke should reveal some secret teaching about Snoke and how he's a parasitic dark entity or Plagueis' essence reincarnate. He should also have some sort of insight on how to defeat him (whether thats going to the World between Worlds, or just ancient knowledge obtained in the great beyond).
5. Finally Rey and Kylo go to fight Snoke, with them ghost Luke returns to the fray to finish Snoke once they kill the body he is possessing when he tries to essence transfer to another. The sequence would include a two on one fight with Rey and Kylo being mostly outmatched by Snoke and only winning after a very tightly contested fight (that might or might not involve Kylo being mortally wounded but landing the killing blow) OR (him and Rey survive to marry and start a New Republic) Then Luke proceeds to return balance to the force by vanquishing Snoke in one last saber duel of ghost in which Luke wins easily against a tired and weakened Snoke who just exerted so much force energy fighting Rey and Kylo . 

&amp;#x200B;

If he did something along those lines, everything about TLJ would turn out to be brilliant and nothing major would be retconned, just expanded on. We saw some crazy game changing stuff in TLJ, and minus Canto Bight and Rose stopping Finn from sacrifice to save the Rebellion (which would have been a perfect character arc BTW), it was honestly pretty good.....Now depending on JJs direction with Episode 9 it could turn out to be absolutely genius or remain the worst SW movie ever made and officially the movie that broke the SW fandom irreparably in half ﻿and set in motion the death of the franchise.

2670,So I got to have a conversation with Timothy Zahn and well we had an interesting conversation on the Star Wars Fandom,"So in Adelaide Supernova I got to have a spare 10 mins to talk to Timothy Zahn. About how he wants Mara Back in the saddle and is ready to go.  How he unfortunately has to wait for Disney to Green light everything. We talked About legends and then we talked about the fandom and it was rather interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

First up Respect. He definitely understands the Hate the fans give to each other but  they cant seem to respect other opinions. We talked about the PT and how much we loved the brilliant story but understood Lucas could of done better.

 But we also said the Same for The OT and ST. We decided to talk about the opinions of the fandom and how there are many more crazy things to get angry and annoyed about in this world (Sexism, racism, Violence ETC.)  I told him I didn't like the ST or what Disney's done with Star wars. There was silence for a few seconds and Timothy's Face said more than words every could. But I told him that I respect those who do enjoy the films.  He nodded and said that's the way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about Legends and how Disney wiped that clean. Yet the stories Characters hardships and universe are still there to enjoy and fall into.  And to divide or Attack others for there love or hate of it is idiotic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Timothy was one of the most open minded human beings I ever met and I enjoyed every moments talking to him (He's pivotal to star wars as much as Lucas in my opinion)  I loved that he traveled halfway across the world for the fans more so than a free trip to another country. 

Before he had to leave We shook hands and went our separate ways But I came out of it believing that the Star wars fandom needs to Be like Zahn or reflect on his words. Respectful, Open minded and willing to listen even if you disagree. ",StarWars,1541393399,WarriorsofAsgard,50,1,True,2018-11-04

Not that critics and fans seemed to appreciate that.

A couple of years ago he was in a car accident, and then administered into a psychiatric facility. What did we do to this kid to turn him into a depressed, mentally ill crimimal? The prequels aren't everyone's favourite - and nor are the sequels, but everyone rushed to the side of Kelly Marie Tran - so why can't we do the same for Jake? Imagine being him, in this situation. He was a young boy, the age of your child, brother or sister. Imagine *being in Star Wars* at that age. And then the whole fanbase turns on you. That would seriously mesd you up.

2692,Hot take: We don't need an Obi-Wan movie. We need a live action Clone Wars movie with Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor,"There isn't a lot of stuffs for Obi-Wan to do between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. He is supposed to lay low to hide from the Empire and watch over Luke. If there is some action, it is probably him telling the sand people to fuck off.

Some people suggest a Obi-Wan vs Maul story in which Maul comes for Luke on the big screen but it has been already done inn Rebels. 

I think the Clone Wars era is one of the best setting for story-telling. A chance to see the Clone Army again in live action but with good CGI? YES. A chance to see Hayden as Anakin and Ewan as Obi-Wan but with proper directing and writing? YES. A chance to see Ian McDiarmid as SHEEV again? YES. A chance to see Samuel Jackson saying MOTHERFUCKER as Mace Windu? Probably cuz PG-13 movie allows one fuck word. Also I think Hayden and Ewan still look young enough to reprise their roles. Temuera Morrison is old now but I think if the Clone Troopers don't take off their helmets, you can have Temuera voice them.

The movie could be set after Ahsoka left the Jedi Order and before season 7 of Clone Wars. Basically Episode 2.5. Would be much better than Obi-Wan as an Episode 3.5.

We could have the movie start with Ewan McGregor as old Obi-Wan in the dessert thinking about his old days in the Clone Wars with Anakin and what went wrong with his apprentice/best friend. Liam Neeson back as a Force Ghost Qui-Gon guiding Obi-Wan through his dessert days.

You'd hop in your upgradable and customizable starship and fly there, possibly passing a fleet of enemy fighters to take out on the way. This opens up the open world aspect. If you want to, you could enter a pod race for some in credits, or travel to Jabba's palace and complete a task for credits. Traveling through the planets there would be the occasional storm trooper enslaving a person for you to beat up or a bounty hunter mugging someone.

So I decided to start my 10-film star wars marathon yesterday with TPM.  I couldn't help but be a little heartbroken that this little boy, the same age as my nephews, put his heart and soul into being in this Star Wars film, only to end in international and universal backlash, physical bullying and torment at school, quitting acting, and developing mental problems.  

It's just heartbreaking.  But Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor play such fantastic father figures for Anakin on screen, and they had to have spent a lot of time with Jake on set and, I'm assuming developed *some* sort of personal connection, right?  

Do you think any of them reached out to him during his crisis and tried to help?

2741,"What happened to the Centrists and Populists, Rian?","One of my favorite books to come out of the new canon is Star Wars: Bloodline, which provides a look at how the New Republic governed the galaxy and the events that led to the formation of the First Order and the Resistance.

Reading about the novel online, it appears that one of the novel’s main draw cards at the time of release was that it contained a number of ideas proposed by none other than Rian Johnson. According to tweets by Pablo Hidalgo (http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2016/05/lucasfilms-pablo-hidalgo-shares-star.html), it was Rian Johnson who came up with the political factions of the Populists and the Centrists, the two factions which vied for supremacy in the New Republic Senate. The Populists, the party Leia belonged to, believed that planets should be left to govern their own affairs, as they feared what would happen if power was concentrated in the hands of a single powerful individual. By contrast, the Centrists, as their name suggests, believed that a strong, centralized government was the best way to bring order to the galaxy. By the end of the novel, many of the Centrists, fed up with the instability that plagued the New Republic, defected to the newly emerging First Order. However, the Senate continued to exist until its destruction by Starkiller Base during the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Since Rian came up with these political factions, and so much time was devoted to fleshing out their ideological differences during Star Wars: Bloodline, I am surprised that we did not see these factions included in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which Johnson wrote and directed. 

In Star Wars: Bloodline we saw that a large number of Centrists joined the First Order, but what about those who remained loyal to the Republic? How did those systems react to the destruction of Hosnian Prime? What about the Populists?  Given that the First Order seems hell-bent on subjugating the entire galaxy, wouldn’t the Populists, the representatives of planets devoted to local autonomy and opposed to centralized power, marshal their forces and join what was left of the Resistance? Wouldn’t the destruction of Hosnian Prime, followed shortly by the destruction of Starkiller Base, have galvanized the galaxy and pushed all remaining Populist systems into the arms of the Resistance? Even if all of these systems’ representatives were killed, does it follow that the New Republic would cease to exist? Couldn’t members simply appoint new representatives and form a government in exile? 

In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, characters repeatedly refer to the Resistance’s allies in the Outer Rim. Will these allies be Populist worlds seeking to stand against the First Order, or will they be factions that we have not seen before? What do people think?

2744,Why Anakin failed where Frodo succeeded," 

## 

📷

Frodo Baggins and Anakin Skywalker are one of the, if not the most iconic characters of their respective franchise. In a hindsight, Lord of the rings and Star Wars are standard high fantasy tales of fulfilling prophecy and  how these two chosen ones save their respective worlds   from the overarching evil force.

The only but major difference between both their arcs was that Frodo achieves the mission of destroying the ring (albeit with the help of Gollum) whereas anakin kills the sith lord after joining the opposing side and becoming Darth Vader.

It is an interesting contrast of characters who were destined to reach the same path but achieved it under very different circumstances.  Introspecting various contributing factors that resulted in such divergent approaches of their mission,  one of the major factor was their surrounding and supporters. Frodo, right from the beginning receives love and compatibility he receives from his friends. Even when he leaves the shire for the mission,he is constantly being encouraged by the fellowship members. The support of Sam through the part of his journey to Mount Doom plays a very key role in maintaining his will power.

Anakin, on the other hand, largely feels isolated within the community that is supposed to be his backbone. It is established that he is attached to his mother but the council of Jedis, who one expects to be broad minded tells him to let go off  feelings towards her. Te death of Anakin's mother plays a huge role in his turn to the dark side.  also, his relationship with Obi wan kenobi never gives the impression that the latter is able to understand his prodigy's psyche. Kenobi does believe Anakin to be the chosen one yet he never seems to find any different approach to make sure that his student's negative traits are eliminated. Not giving Anakin seat of master in the council was also a huge miscalculation by the Jedi's.

Another contributing factor was the way the patriarchs of the respective universes treat the gifted individuals.  Gandalf is one of the most respected beings of the middle-earth and his approach towards the other humbled humanoids of the universe. His confidence towards Frodo helps the latter to remain strong willed during his mission. The fatherly approach of Gandalf always allows Frodo to trust him and so does the objective of destroying the ring is so important for Frodo because he trusts every single word of Gandalf.

Yoda, on the other hand doesn't utilize his perceiving powers with Anakin.  He openly dismisses a young boy separated from mother and doesn't give him a single chance to prove his worth. He always maintains a distant relationship with Anakin when in fact the troubled Jedi needed a personal sense of belonging from the head of the institution. Yoda' counselling sessions aren't helpful in removing the distractions hovering Anakin's mind.

However, like in most of the great stories it is the character's own actions, motives and decisions is the primary  factor in determining whether the protagonist achieves victorious or ends up being a tragic hero. In both the tales, it is their approach towards the larger scheme of things that differentiates their timing of fulfilling the prophecy.

Frodo, even when the ring was taking strong control over him, remains steadfast of not getting lured by the temptation. even though it is indicated that he is wary of the trickery of Gollum, he maintains his patience knowing that trusting Gollum, who knew the routes is the best way to save the world. Even though seduction of  ring got the better of him in the end, one can't deny that he took fought his own body and mind to reach till the end and his trust towards Gollum, though in an ironic way,  eventually does paid off.

Anakin on the other hand is always deviated from his main objective.  Even though, he does recognize his sense of duty towards the republic, Anakin is easily swayed and manipulated by Chancellor Palpatine. There is little argument that his peers don't provide him the support that he requires,  Anakin never helps his case either by not sacrificing his personal gains for the greater good of the universe.

Frodo doesn't fear sacrificing his beloved homeland realizing what is at stakes for the world whereas Anakin  gets into matrimonial relationship with Padme, despite being warned of the repercussions, when the republic is on the verge of crumbling.

There is an captivating contrast of characters who were unique and special, born in rags but destined to gain riches and how their destiny end up being vastly diversified despite both of them fulfilling the prophecy of saving the world.",StarWars,1538577271,vigyattewari,0,1,True,2018-10-03

2753,My take on episode 8's silent killers,"we've seen millions of these posts before so let me save you the bullshit and get into it.

Episode 8 was an odd one, im not going to suggest a total rework of the film or how I think it should have been written but more so how the direction of a few shots ruined the films pace.  


Firstly the space opener, Hux becoming a laughably weak character wasn't so bad but it was just executed so poorly, I mean he literally just lost his base. but there's 2 gags back to back Poe pranking him and Snoke force flipping him across the galaxy (i'll let you think about that)  it seemed like they we're both filmed in the event that one of them wasn't making it to the final cut but somehow did being so close together it ruins the setting/theme of starwars (usually one subtle liners not whole scenes)

  
fix 1 - don't spam jokes to fill film time  


Secondly the music in this film wasn't as present or as powerful as the previous 8 films. (don't believe me? watch any other SW movie, the prequels music tracks are some of the best wouldn't mind some of those being thrown in) 

  
fix 2 - pay John Williams more he deserves it! Music has the power to convey stories on their own.  


On to the third point and more of a reference to most scenes in the film, Rey passing Luke the saber had to be the most mind bending scene ever. This hurt me the most honestly! I get what he tried to do with throwing it over the shoulder but  literally if he had thrown it to his side or even just dropped it, would have turned out so much more natural. Star Wars has never had so much Drama at this point they could have cut the film into a TV comedy show.

  
fix 3 - stop over dramatising every action and scene, we're not blind we don't need it exaggerated to understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd go on but this is literally the first 30 mins of the film if that. I'm not a director or film producer this is just my take on where this episode wen't wrong and what 9 could do to help it.  


Special mentions:  


BB-8 Smashing his head to solve the circuit problem. (Was this a goof of how the scenes where shot?)  
Chewie debating to eat a porg goes on too long would have been fine if it was cut in half  
Knights of Ren who, why, what and where they go?  
Snoke had no dialogue hinting to his past, just a single line of an old story to tell kylo of his past..

2760,A way to redeem characters for Episode 9,"Ok, so pre-text, I thought of this while watching filmhaus talking about TLJ, and thinking about how you can still make a badass movie out of 9 and redeem some qualities and characters of episode 8 and possibly bringing both parties back to camp so to speak. And before I begin, I'll preface, I did not like TLJ, I felt it killed a lot of character development and undermined potential characters, like Snoke, but that's not a debate for here. So on with the show.

What if, episode 9 begins and you learn that TLJ was a force premonition from Snoke, but one that Luke had sensed and was influencing, and one that Rey, who we know can see visions, witnessed while in meditation with Luke. This would do 4 things.

1. This would show how Snoke got to where he was and showcase his power. How'd he and the first order become so powerful? He was watching the future, knew what was going to happen before it did. He knew he had to let the empire die, because he saw Sidious and Vader destroy him if he was still around, etc etc, makes him from ""scary powerful bad guy"" to ""Evil god, we're all going to die"" that seems fitting to face off to Luke.

2. Showcase how powerful Luke is now. Now we know that he can sense and influence force premonitions from across the universe. This goes into how stupid powerful he'd have become after being powerful enough to withstand Darth Vader, who was already stupid powerful. It would also showcase why Luke stranded himself, because if he snapped no one could stand up to him.

3. It would make scenes in TLJ that were, in my opinion, ill conceived, make sense. Mary Poppins Leia? Nope, Luke was throwing off Snoke. Rey's parentage, clouded so Snoke can't use it. Hidden rebel base within eyeshot of the cruiser, come on, like they'd be that transparent. We could even have an awesome end scene where it's Snoke who tracks the rebels down, sees Luke step out to confront him, but instead of it being a projection 
Luke it's a real Luke, which Snoke finds out as he tries to pass through him (that's where the entire audience could be clued in that Luke changed the vision). Awesome fight scene, crazy force powers on display, literal eye candy.

4. It would give Rey a reason to not become a Jedi and break the cycle. She saw both extremes, what the Jedi will do and what the dark side will do. Things like Luke's and Kylo's backstory would have to be set in stone, Snoke would know that already, so she sees neither side are particularly good guys, she goes down the middle.

Anyways, doubt they'd go that direction, but opinions? Thoughts? Like I said, I think this might have been a way to bring the crowd back together and not undue TLJ completely but also allow there to be more than a hand full of rebels. ",StarWars,1538608719,Beeried,23,1,True,2018-10-03

2772,Open for discussion,"So I’ve been a Star Wars fan for basically my entire life. I grew up with all of the toys from the revamp in 1999. I have so many great memories from Star Wars that (like the entire community)it holds a very special place in my heart. And that’s really the beauty of Star Wars, it really speaks to everyone in its own unique and special way.

When I first heard about a new Star Wars being launch and it being from Disney, I was very excited, and the trailer that LITERALLY broke the internet for TFA made the 5 year old me come out again. 

After watching TFA, I fell in love with it. I recognize the fact that it was very similar to a new hope, but I believe that this was a safe route for Disney/Lucas film to take, and I felt that there was enough there to create a new story different from all the others. Rouge one came out and even though I am a heavy believer in continuity, I again fell In love with yet another Star Wars movie, it was awesome seeing all the different vehicals like the tie striker and the at-act.

Then there was the last Jedi...
Seeing the trailer I was very hyped to see that the story looked to be going a different direction, and possible hinting at the fact that Ray would turn to the dark side which I would have loved to see. And on that Thursday night at 9pm with my limited edition popcorn can and my soda cup, I was ready. 

Never have I ever left the movies so angry before. My gripes are similar to a lot of popular opinions but in short, there are curtain things that you expect to see in a Star Wars movie, that’s what makes a Star Wars movie a wait for it...Star Wars movie. I can understand why people would like it, in fact there are a lot of small parts in the movie that I loved! However as a whole is where I have a problem. I like the idea of Ryan Johnson’s message of “letting the past die” and that the franchise was taking a new direction! Again I loved that. But instead of paving your own path, I felt the last Jedi did a 90 degree turn to the left and deforest the woods all of the paths were on.

So, when solo was coming out, I was very very excited to see my favorite characters lando and Han on the screen in a prequel, however I made a really hard choice when it was about to release. I refused to go opening weekend, which is something that most of not all Star Wars fans try to attempt in-order to avoid spoilers. I wanted solo to fail at the box office.

The music; score; scale; fights; and the emotion in the movie. All the other Star Wars movies created since 1983 pale into insignificance next to it. It’s like an adult indie film, but 100% Star Wars at the same time.

I would love to see the data, but suspect the majority of those that grew up with the OT will view Rogue One as the true start of the saga... and perhaps a last revisit to their childhood.

Then later, on Endor, Luke is now perceptive enough to see the conflict Vader ignores within himself, to the point that he forced him to truly question the Dark Side for the first time since he had fallen to it. 

Alone, I doubt the Emperor could have turned Luke either, considering Luke only came close to turning once Vader threatened his sister, and then, I feel that killing Vader in rage rather than the Emperor would truly be what turned him.

2805,"Luke is actually a bad guy in the original trilogy. (Or, at the very least, he doesn't join the Rebellion because he's a good guy)","TL/DR: according to the [deleted scenes](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs9sum) with Biggs Darklighter in a New Hope, Luke is a member of Tattooine's privileged, corrupt nobility and joins the rebellion because the Empire is threatening to impose law and order on Tattooine, as well as a land redistribution scheme that would see him and his friends lose their noble status.  This explains why Luke joins the Rebellion for seemingly no reason.

Throughout the original trilogy we are never given a real reason as to why Luke joined the rebellion.

The first reason that people usually attribute to Luke joining the rebellion is because Obi Wan told him that Vader killed his father. But Luke doesn't actually care about this at time. Immediately after telling Luke this, Obi Wan asks him to leave the planet to go fight the Imperials and Luke's response is ""nah.""

The next reason is because the Imperials murdered Uncle Owen. But again, while Luke doesn't seem too disturbed by that fact. If anything, he gets excited because now he can leave the planet.

So why does Luke want to leave the planet and ultimately join the rebellion? The simple answer is because his good bud, Biggs Darklighter, who had been studying to be an Imperial pilot at the Imperial Academy, was trying to join the rebellion and Luke wanted to join up with his bud.

Originally the movie was going to contain a large number of scenes in which Luke meets Biggs on Tattooine shortly after Leia is captured. In these scenes, Biggs tells Luke that he's joining the rebellion and asks Luke to go. The only reason that Luke refuses is because his Uncle Owen was one season away from paying off a big loan on the moisture farm, and Luke didn't want to dick his Uncle over by leaving. [These scenes were all filmed, but were cut from the final release of the movie.](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs9sumhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs9sum)

So why does Biggs want to join the rebellion? According to those deleted scenes both Biggs doesn't like the fact that the Empire is planning on imposing Imperial law, or Imperial taxes on Tattooine.

Now keep in mind, Tattoonie is a lawless world in which most people live in abject poverty and vices like drug use and slavery are rampart. So why wouldn't Biggs be willing to trade some taxes for the imposition of law?

The answer to that is that Luke and Biggs are the equivalent of feudal lords on Tattooine. Their families own large amounts of land which they use to produce the little water that is available for Tattooine's population. Thanks to these landholdings, their families are extremely wealthy, at least for people on Tattooine. Just keep in mind - on a planet in which most people are slaves Luke's family was able to easily afford a land speeder, and a 3P0 and R2D2 unit - luxuries far beyond what most other people could afford.

Oh, and don't forget. It was a trifle for Biggs or Luke to be accepted into/pay for the Imperial Academy - the single most exclusive institution in the entire galaxy. Going to the Imperial Academy was something that most people on core worlds couldn't hope for. But it was something that was within reach for a planet's nobility - even a remote backwater planet like Tattooine, which is why Biggs was accepted and why Luke expected to be accepted as a matter of course if he applied.

Luke simply wouldn't benefit from Imperial law. Human slavery would be outlawed - and we all know how much Uncle Owen's dad loved buying human slaves. It stands to reason that Biggs' family also owned human slaves, which they would stand to lose and/or be punished for under Imperial rule.

In The Return of the Jedi we see a slice of the life of excess lived by Jaba the Hut, and it stands to reason that nobles like Luke and Biggs also lived a similar, if not toned down version of that life that would come to an end with Imperial rule.

But, at least most importantly to Biggs, the Empire was planning on addressing poverty on the planet through a land redistribution scheme - a scheme that would deprive Luke and Biggs of their noble status. That scheme is ultimately why Biggs joins, and how he convinces Luke that joining the rebellion is the right thing to do.

So Luke doesn't ultimately join the rebellion because he wants to do good. He joins it because the Empire is threatening to impose law and order on Tattooine - and that would mean an end to Luke's status as a member of the planet's corrupt nobility.",StarWars,1538687036,veemondumps,1,1,True,2018-10-04

*Opening crawl has just faded away. Camera pans over an unknown jungle planet. A single tie-fighter jumps out of hyperspace*

“This is so strange” Zay thought for herself. 

It had been three months since they jumped into hyperspace from D’Qar with the mission to find General Organa’s allies. The coordinates provided by the general had made them end up on Rishi, a jungle planet with a surrounding field of debris, showing that there once had been a civilisation here.

“I wonder who we were meant to find here?” Shriv said loudly. Zay looked at her blue coloured uncle. He was the only family she had left after loosing both her mother Iden and her father. Shriv was a little bit pessimistic from time to time, but this time his question was valid. 

“The General said we were looking for an old friend. And if he is a friend of the resistance, he might need to hide this far out” Zay said with a little bit of concern in her voice. What if this contact had already been found by the First order? What if no one was here? What if….

Suddenly, blaster fire. Six red blast just flying past the ship, making the fighter shake uncontrollably. Zay looks around but cannot see the point of origin. Four new blasts, and then a single small ship passes the tie fighter. The ship has a dark red colour and wears the rebellion insignia.

“That is an old A-wing” Shriv shouts and opens a commchannel “This is Shriv Suurgav, clearance code seven-three-tau, we are friendlies and have an urgent message from General Organa”

The hail is met with silence. The A-wing turns around towards the tie-fighter. It is within firing range. Zay closes her eyes, she will not fire back. But nothing happens, no sound except for the engines of the Tie-fighter. Then a small beep.  Zay opens her eyes and see the holocommunicator activated. In front of her is an old man, hair is a mixture between grey and black and eyes looks tired. 

“Shriv? What the hell is going on?” The man says. 

“The resistance needs its allies. Leia sent me to find her contact, I never expected it to be you. I have a holo-disk from the general. We are asking for permission to land.” Shriv says. 

“Of course, you can land my friend. But you need to update that ship. Flying around in a tie-fighter will never do you good” the man answers. “I will send you the coordinates for a good landing spot”. 

The holo ends, and the nav computer lights up with the new coordinates. Shriv adjusts the course and starts descending towards the planet. There is silence is the cockpit. Zay have so many questions, but why isn’t Shriv saying anything? How long should she wait until breaking the silence? Several minutes passes. Zay takes a deep breath.

“Uncle Shriv, who was that man?” 

“That, my dear Zay, was Lando Calrissian.” Shriv answers.

2812,New stars wars capital ship based off the I-500 submarine,"so i have noticed that there is no ""submarine"" type ships in star wars. here is a great video describing how a submarine would work in star wars by MetaNerdz.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGOsMHETUSE

Now subs can place mines, and act covertly in an environment that others cannot do.

Now in legends the empire used to place mines at the entrances from hyperspace lanes to hinder their use. what if a ship could do this and act as a capital ship designed to incapacitate larger capital ships.

The I-500 class submarine was a submarine used in the second world war by the japanese and it carrier 3 aircraft. an aircraft carrying submarine.

my thought on this is a cylindrical ship with two hulls and a small hanger on top that can open up and launch a small number of bombers and fighters. 

The ship would be armed with 2 ion canons on either side of the ship on the outside of each hull while the 2 hulls are connected. and a ion canon at the rear to incapacitate any ships that are trailing it. and would be armed with 8 torepedo tubes (4 on each hull) and carry 4 bombers, and 6 fighters.

The ship would stay in hyperspace and monitor when ships enter hyperspace and which lanes are being used. (taking hyperspace tracking out of the picture)

How the ship would operate is it would find a ship that is an enemy in the hyperspace lane and would basically follow it to it location through hyperspace and then open up with its ion cannons to incapacitate the ship in question, release all of its fighters and bombers to takeout the ship, then escape through the hyperspace lane again to monitor other ships. 

Ship dimensions:
- length: 200 metres
- Width: 50 metres
- hanger bay length: 100 metres
- hanger width: 30 meters
- armament: total of 5 ion cannons and 8 proton torpedo tubes with 120 torpedeos
- 400 people to operate minimum of 85
- 150 troops

this is my first star wars ship concept and cant really draw. i tried to descibe it the best i can, and i hope you all like it.

2824,My Issue with The Mandalorian (as a concept),"Funny thing about *The Mandalorian* as a concept is that like with most modern Star Wars live action projects it ignores lore in exchange for marketability. The Mandalorians are known to be a warring tribe of like minded peoples of various races that travel in groups. The lone gunman idea is a call  back to Jango and Boba Fett who are technically outliers in normal Mandalorian behavior because they worked alone much of the time. Yet even Boba worked with other bounty hunters for a large part of his career. If anything, Enfys Nest &amp; her band in *Solo* are the most authentic depiction of Mandalorian culture and practice in a live action Star Wars work to date. But as per usual everyone, producers and viewers alike, will ignore canon and lore for sensationalism that plays on nostalgia while hypocritically continuing to pan Episodes 7 &amp; 8. Because  breaking the rules in Star Wars only seems to matter when they break the ""wrong"" rules. 

Now some people will of course say ""Mandalorians are a race not a diverse group of like minded peoples"" and disagree with my argument. But this is where time period comes in. The Taung would be the appropriate race to label the original Mandalorians. The planet Mandalore was named after their leader Mand'alor which eventually became a title as opposed to a given name.  In my reading of the canon, Mandalorians are like Sith. They started out as a singular race but due to years of war their population plummeted &amp; they slowly devolved into a makeshift political/religious system that other races (mostly vagabonds, loners, &amp; refugees) eventually joined becoming part of their tribes and culture.

So if we are talking old Republic or even pre-Old Republic days then yes I would agree that the Mandalorians should be depicted as a singular race, but probably shouldn't even be referred to as the Mandalorians at that point. But since this new project will be set in the post Republic/pre-First Order era, they shouldn't be depicted as a singular race. Yes I am aware that other Mandalorians have been loners in the past such as  Sabine Wren. But using outliers to depict an entire culture/group isn't a realistic or valid justification. I would much rather watch an authentic, lore focused series about a Mandalorian band/tribe of mercs that focused as much on the cultural practices of the people as much as the pew pew violence.

In before the EU isn't canon anymore because Disney killed it.   

P.S. I am not a fan of Episodes 7 &amp; 8 but my reasons for disliking them are based on lore &amp; canon, not anti-diversity nonsense. ",StarWars,1538702681,DJMMT,20,1,True,2018-10-04

One of the Sith Lords thinks that the Galactic Republic's existence is just a myth.

However, when Dan Wallace was writing the New Essential Chronology, Leland Chee insisted that the Jedi Exiles becoming the Dark Lords of the Sith happened 7000 years before the movies. As a result, starting with the New Essential Chronology, the EU said that the ""second great schism"", which occurred 7000 years before the movies, was what kicked off the war between the Jedi and what would become the Dark Lords of the Sith. Personally, I hate this retcon because it contradicts Golden Age of the Sith's dialogue about the ""first great schism"" and it leaves only 2000 years for the situation seen in Golden Age of the Sith to develop, which I don't find plausible.",StarWars,1538722014,darklordoftech,1,1,True,2018-10-05

2841,What do you guys think a modern day jedi would look like in different countries?,"I was thinking today of what a jedi would look like today in America.  What we know of them says that they wear humble clothing but not trashy or ancient.  So what does that relate to in the US?  My thoughts branch into two ways, maybe 3.  My thought is that it wouldn't be interesting at all.  So dont expect anything interesting.  Just a fun showerthought.

The first idea I had is in my opinion the most likely.  Since they dont really do formal I think they would wear jeans.  Its humble, but given the right fit, its not flashy either.  As for shoes I would think either converse or just some sort of I expensive sneakers.  As for torso wear, I was no d of torn.  If we are thinking mild climate, I bet they'd wear long sleeve textured henley.(they are those almost sweater shirts with the 3 buttons at the collar).  They are subtle but still look ok as well.  And unfortunately that's pretty much it aside from a jacket replacing the robe.  Couple ideas here.  I wasn't sure if a peacoat could be subtle enough but ill throw that in.  Zip up hoodie is probably the best bet here due to its versatility and common...ness.

The next idea I had would take on more of a sporty look for utility.  Basketball pants for these fellas.  I see a bunch of dudes wearing these.  Sports shoes again.  Shirt could go a few ways.  Obviously not everyone wears the same thing, but I think, say obi wan, would wear just a t shirt, maybe a compress shirt, but not likely because they kind of draw attention.  So probably like a shirt with some logo like Nike or something.  Jacket would obviously be a track jacket.( I think thats the smooth zip up jackets that have a raised collar) not sure since I'm not sporty

My third idea is a little more adult I guess is the word.  I think here they would wear khakis.  Maybe other slacks or chinos.  Some shoes that look nice with the pants but are still comfortable.  Dress boots?  As for the shirt they could do button down or polo.  Either really would work.  This one I am not sure of in terms of jacket/ coat.  A peacoat or something similar would look fine with the button down, but not the polo I would think.

Well there we go for US. pretty underwhelming isn't it.  I kinda bored myself typing it up.  But that's the jedi.  Unassuming.  So what do you guys think?

2861,"The Secura Order 66 Debacle, Solved (hopefully)","During Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Order 66 was executed, and millions of clone troopers hunted down their Jedi officers all across the Galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a *small* debate that's been circulated around the Star Wars fandom whenever this is brought up. One ideology that fans have taken up believes that the 327th hated Secura for dragging them through the horrid brush, and expressed their anger by continuously firing on her. Another school of thought lays claim to the idea that they wanted to kill her as an act of mercy, and that it was the reason why Bly and the others kept firing on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to deliver my own theory on why I believe that Bly and the squad he had at hand kept firing on her as an act of mercy. If anybody wishes to debate, I'll respond respectfully. I find this kind of thing to be fun! Now, let's set the scene:

&amp;#x200B;

Felucia was lush, exotic world, with varying flora and fauna, it provided a home not only to the Felucians, but also non-Felucian settlers who sought out a life there.

&amp;#x200B;

But for those offworlders who went deep into the interior, the Felucian forests were a living nightmare. Hundreds of species of vicious animals, poisonous insectoids and flesh-eating diseases attacked any group of organics moving through it's breadth.

&amp;#x200B;

The clones of the 327th Star Corps had to fight a two-way battle against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who's metal droid army had dug their unfeeling heels into the planet's soil, daring the troops of the Republic to come in after them.

&amp;#x200B;

There had been many battles fought on Felucia during the Clone Wars, but this time around, they were a purely oppressive force. Commerce Guild President Shu Mai had created a laboratory there, filled with deadly toxins that were tested on local lifeforms, including sentients. The contingency plan for if the base was breached by Republic troops was to release all of the airborne chemicals, which would affect the area for miles around the laboratory.

&amp;#x200B;

Separatist moves like this one forced the 327th to fight a lengthy campaign. And at the end of that campaign, Aayla Secura was killed, by concentrated fire from Commander Bly and his fellow troopers.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe that Bly and the forefront elements of the 327th held any hatred in their hearts for their Jedi General. She referred to them as fellow humanoids, valued their skills, and always tried to operate as efficiently as possible to reduce casualties. She was known for being strict, and for not allowing her emotions and attachments to impede her leading and fighting prowess. The funny thing about this mentality she had, was that while she was great with not allowing her attachments to mess anything up, she had several. Take this excerpt from the novel True Colors for an example:

&amp;#x200B;

""...But a certain distance is required from our troops, clone or not. General Secura is becoming a little to close to Commander Bly, and while I applaud her dedication to the men under her command, this can only end in tears."" — Arligan Zey to Mace Windu

&amp;#x200B;

Secura reminds me of some of the older Jedi, and especially as the newer Jedi under the New Republic, -we're talking KOTOR &amp; other Expanded Universe stuff here. Yes, it counts in my opinion.- in that while she didn't let her attachments cloud her judgement, she let her emotions flow into attachments to create healthy bonds. The polar opposite of any Jedi who held their emotions within. This is the Jedi who briefly pursued a romantic relationship with Kit Fisto, according to Wookiepedia. It is very likely that she had a close friendship with Bly.

&amp;#x200B;

""The General's good. Knows her stuff and doesn't waste time. Got to respect that."" The Jedi General who led him and his men through hell and back did so under direct orders from the Jedi High Council, not because she wanted to. I think the opinion of a certain 501st trooper can sum up Bly's opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

"" Without her iron will, none of us would have come out of that mess with our sanity, or our lives. When her death came, I hope it was quick. She earned that much.""

""When the 501st was finally rotated out of Felucia, Aayla Secura made a point of seeing us off personally, calling us the bravest soldiers she had ever seen. It's a good thing we were wearing helmets, because none of us could bear to look her in the eye.""

\-501st Journal, Star Wars Battlefront II (2005)

&amp;#x200B;

When Bly received Contingency Order 66, there are two possible timelines: In Legends, he had a choice, influenced by years of flash training that told him to obey the Supreme Chancellor. In Canon, his actions were completely controlled by the inhibitor chip.

&amp;#x200B;

But... Were they really? It is quite possible that the foreign bacteria on Felucia messed with the inhibitor chip enough that it's effects were dimmed, and Bly was actually able to cognitively think about what he was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

""It got quiet suddenly… Bly, do you think it's droids?""

""No.""

&amp;#x200B;

I know, I know. Canon is Canon, Legends is Legends, headcanon is headcanon. But if we're debating whether or not the 327th HATED their Jedi General, that involves exploring motives. What did they think of her beforehand, and what did they think of her afterword?

&amp;#x200B;

Picture this: you are a clone commander who is close to your Jedi General. She has led you through thick and thin, you can still remember that time when she made use of your unit's various skills to acquire a tactical droid's head, and how she encouraged everyone. You've fought hundreds of battles with her, and she's always treated you and your's well, to the best of her ability. She may be one of the few Jedi actually qualified to lead a unit of clones.

&amp;#x200B;

Order 66 comes down the line. She must die. If you do not eliminate this supposed traitor to the Republic, someone else has to. They might give her a slow, painful death, depending on how circumstances turn out. There is no certainty it will be quick, or painless, unless you carry it out.

&amp;#x200B;

You knock her down with a blaster bolt to the back, she feels it. There is now a gaping, burning hole in her. If she's left alive more than a couple of seconds longer, if that blast doesn't kill her outright, she will have time to realize that her soldiers, her friends, have turned on her.

&amp;#x200B;

So you and the entire squad unleash a volley upon her, immediately frying her nerves so that she feels nothing, and putting enough holes in her that the Force cannot possibly ensure she survives. As she was merciful in your life, you were merciful in her death.

2872,"For someone who hasn't enjoyed the ""conclusion"" of Han, Luke, and Leia... would the new canon books/comics help?","So, I'm not here to debate whether or not the new trilogy has provided satisfactory characterization and conclusion to the three heroes of the OT. Some of you really liked it, some of us really didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I do keep in mind about the trilogy, though, is that the rather unhappy situations those characters find themselves in are relatively new developments in their lives. Han and Leia were a family for longer than they weren't. Luke was a Jedi Master long before he was a recluse in self-imposed exile. While I'll never really like seeing those characters die off for the advancement of characters and a plot that I haven't entirely bought into, if I had a history of their heroics while still in their prime... establishing peace in the galaxy and warding off remnants of the empire... I feel like I may accept their character arcs in the new trilogy a little more and probably enjoy the series more than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, some people agree with my opinion about the new trilogy and others don't. This is not a post trying to incite that argument, nor is it something I want fans of the new trilogy to shut me down over (inb4: ""If you don't like it too bad just go read Legends and stay in the corner""). I'm asking people from both camps if the supporting material provides stories that would make a dejected fan a little more optimistic about the new canon.

2874,Just got back from seeing Solo for the first time. Here are my thoughts.,"# What I thought:

* Visuals. Looked good. Looked like Star Wars. No complaints. CGI was decent, liked the practical effects/props.
* Stormtroopers/Empire. I liked their look, they weren't in it much but when they were the empire looked and had the tone of the Empire.
* Locations: Nice variety in locations, all seemed interesting.
* Han: Liked the portrayal of Han, very cocky and confident, definitely well done. Good handling of love interest.
* Qi'ara: Again, well acted. I liked the evolution from teenage girlfriend to confident crime syndicate lifestyle. I like how she is a pragmatist who understand how the game works.
* Beckett?: Loved this dude, was like a farther-son relationship with Han. The betrayal hurt, but was well suited to the story. Well done.
* The other crew members seemed fine, fit their role well for the short while they were around.
* Chewie! Loved how he was introduced and his friendship with Han developing. Really feels like they did a good job setting the scene for why they are BFFs, and a nice touch seeing Chewie meet the wookies.
* L-3. This is an example of when a political theme can work really well in Star Wars! (take notes TLJ) It was simple, a robot wanting robot rights, and being zealous in her pursuit. Great comedy. Sad ending :( Well handled.
* Lando: Very very well done, felt exactly like Lando, I like how he had great concern for himself and his possessions and was a true swindler. Great to see how Han got the Falcon, it felt very appropriate to see him loose that Sabbak game, you just knew if had to end that way haha.
* Vision. Loved the sadistic humor/charming evil dude portrayal. Well handled.
* That pirate person who turned out to be just a kid. Liked them at first during the train hiest scene. Hated the reveal of them being some poor down trodden people. Didn't need the whole ""crime syndicates hurt people, \*sniff\*"" thing, I already got enough by seeing how Qi'ara was being forced into her relationship with Vision (which btw felt fine, it was a nice portrayal of how peopel are treated as property by the crime families). So yeah, handled poorly.
* The Kessel run. Ehh, I'm not sure, I was expecting something different, I thought getting to Kessel would be difficult in of itself; it seemed fine, like they just followed those beacons and they got there, heck even the fat ISD could do it. Could have been a lot better, though the Maw scene was exciting.
* Back story for young Han trying to get off Kessel and separated from Qi'ara, all really good and compelling.
* Serving in the Empire and meeting the crew, meeting Chewie, the train hesit, all good.
* Meeting Lando and the Kessel segment, all good, run could have been better.
* Refining planet, good conclusion, liked Han's plan, Beckett's ultimate lesson, and how Qi'ara moved on with her situation.
* Mauls' CGI looking fucking dreadful lol.

Yeah, overall, a solid 7.5/10. Zero major complaints, couple things I would have done differently. Visuals were good, acting was very good, film was tonally good, felt like a Star Was movie, no pushing of political agendas, great characters, friendships and development.

2902,I'd love to see Episode 9 go in this direction,"I had a feeling with the ending of Last Jedi, galaxy commoners would come to the aid of the resistance, after seeing that little kid use the force on the broom.  The galaxy is inspired by (luke? rey? someone?) to truly vanquish the Order.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats probably whats going to happen considering an entire solar system was wiped out in Awaken, I mean how the fuck would anyone else in the galaxy act like they'll stand for that like they did by submitting to the Empire.  Last Jedi should've shown the galaxies' reaction/plan to deal with this threat.  But everyone in the casino hell, that whole planet, felt contempt and fine with it.  I suppose they were under the Orders good graces because of the weapon fiasco but STILL, I'm fairly certain a good portion if not the whole galaxy witnessed the Order obliterating an ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM yet its like the only people who care at all is the very small and pretty much (at this point) insignificant Rebel...Resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly hope Episode 9 plays out that way, the galaxy joining forces to overthrow their new oppressors. Giving actual weight to the plot.  It pretty much has to go that way considering the entire resistance is reduced to 12 people lol. I mean SERIOUSLY where is everyone, with this new trilogy we've gotten (4..?) new planets and barely anyone lives on them.  This would be a great opportunity to recognize the prequels as well. This last film MUST acknowledge the prequels in someway to tie it all together considering this is it, the ending to star wars (hopefully haha).  Maybe show various species/factions we saw in the prequels joining forces (yes even Gungans...).  Although I have a feeling we'll only be seeing forces we saw in the OT such as Hutt clans and Landos connections to various crime syndicates come to the aid of the Rebels.  Yet if that IS that case I still feel thats very cheap and a cop-out to still avoid anything to do with the prequels because whether you like them (which I do) or not, They are still star wars and will always be a vital part to the overall story we have and they need to not be ignored in Episode 9.

2909,How the ending of The Last Jedi should have been...,"The Last Jedi was disappointing for a Star Wars movie because it doesn't have the one thing all movies of the saga should have... a lightsaber duel.

If the movie was directed properly, it wouldn't be such a bad movie. The scene on Crait would be different but the end wouldn't change much... 

On Ach-to, Luke would lift his X-wing (just like how Yoda did in TESB), get his green lightsaber and actually go to Crait instead of projecting himself. Kylo and the First  Order's troops would see the X-wing then Kylo would order every gun they have to fire on that ship. All shots would miss, or even hit other AT-M6s because Like would trip one of them with a cord, like what he did in TESB. Kylo, seeing that shooting the ship has no effect, would go down challenging Luke duel him. Luke jumps off his X-wing without landing it (making it crash on an AT-M6), and ignite his saber. While Luke and Kylo are down, Hux is in the ship, he orders an 3 AT-M6s to shoot Luke, Luke reflects 2 shots while stopping 1 with the force (Like what Kylo did in TFA) then he moves to the side and let's go of the laser. The laser would hit the ground. Kylo turns on his saber. The fight will have same dialogue except, they're having a real duel, something worth watching. At the end of the duel, Luke would look at the resistance troopers leaving while Leia is at the end, still watching the fight. The see each other, the camera focuses on Leia, then on Luke. He closes his eyes, then sacrifices himself exactly like how Kenobi did in ANH. He would lift his lightsaber then vanish right before Kylo's saber hits him. On top of his robe we will see not just his lightsaber, but also Han's dice. He was holding it in his other hand the whole time. Kylo picks up the dice, stares at it, then throws it away while shouting. He would get Luke's saber then keep it with him, which would reappear in Episode IX. The events after that would remain the same.

The only difference is that Kylo has Luke's lightsaber at the end and of course, the movie's ratings would've been better.",StarWars,1535974296,PillarofDeception,1,0,True,2018-09-03

2923,I finally got around to watching The Last Jedi [Spoilers],"Overall it wasn’t the best Star Wars movie, when Poe went up to The First Orders Star Destroyer and pulled a “hello can you here me?” Joke I knew this wasn’t going to be good. Star Wars in my opinion held a fine line on an Action/Drama with a sprinkle of comedy mixed into it, let’s say about a 60:30:10 ratio. When I watched something like The Last Jedi it felt more on the lines of a 40:20:40, I even compared it to something of trying to be a Marvel movie. They tried to add way to much story into the movie also, from the weird sea lizard in the background at Luke’s Island to the stuff like the ice cats how they just showed up and now they are just a thing.

The plot was hard to follow with I think 3 different stories all together? I was lost, especially during Finn and Roses scenes, they decided it would make sense that instead of going to the master code breaker to trust Benicio Del Toro because he was able to break out of a jail cell with a card. And then to use his character to bring in a “war is for money” thing which I didn’t care about. 

And one of the biggest complaints I had was Rose, before I start I am pro women I’m not one of those sexist people that doesn’t want women protagonists in my Star Wars. I just think that Rose was just kind of annoying, she was trying to do too much good to the point where you’d almost stop watching the movie. I feel like they could’ve done a better job with her character and she would’ve been much more lovable, but honestly I didn’t like her.

With that talent and experience under his belt, I'd feel he'd do a great job branching off into other voice acting roles. Maybe he could voice a villain in a future Star Wars movie.

2931,Rian Johnson subverted the expectations of mathematics.,"Holdo says there are 400 people left across three ships after Kylo's attack. These people eventually all get consolidated on the Raddus. There are 30 transports launched from the Raddus, and only 6 of them make it to Crait. Each transport can hold up to [60 passengers plus 3 crew spots] (https://i.imgur.com/c9Th7gM.jpg). So at most you would need 7 transports to evacuate every Resistance member on the Raddus.

The problem is two-fold: the first issue is fuel scarcity. Poe is alarmed when he sees that Holdo is fueling up the transports. There's a finite amount remaining and it's really weird to divide it 30 ways versus 7. Less transports equals less prep time, less fuel(or more fuel per transport) and less logistics. And then the second big issue is secrecy. If the great plan Holdo came up with is to sneak off the Raddus in plain sight of the Supremacy and merely hope they won't be paying attention, it seems far better and sneakier to use fewer transports. With 30 transports you are far more likely to be spotted. Forget ""stealth"" tech... did Holdo forget that these ion engines light up blue against space, like 30 fireflies heading to Crait?

So if we assume an equal distribution of Resistance among the transports, it's roughly 12 passengers each and a skeleton crew of a single pilot. Besides the fact that sending under-loaded transports doesn't make sense, this would only leave 78 Resistance members on Crait. That doesn't wash with the numbers on the scene in the battle. Both the [rear trenches] (https://i.imgur.com/9AM2khG.jpg) and [forward trenches] (https://i.imgur.com/MI4jDK6.jpg) are packed, plus 3 people on each big turret.

2939,Can someone please help me find this Star Wars fan-film?,"I remember all the details, just not the name.

So this live-action film (pretty short, maybe 10 minutes or less) starts with a bunch of Jedi getting killed by Sith troopers. The main Jedi guy remembers his girlfriend, who is being kidnapped by the Sith and put on a shuttle. 

The Jedi grabs his lightsaber and tears his way through the Sith troopers, until eventually he gets to the Shuttle where he fights off  against the Sith, who sends the shuttle away while he fights with the Jedi.

 It's worthwhile to note that they both kind of look alike, they are both white guys with brown hair, but the Sith guy wears black robes and paint on his face. 

They fight for a while, going back and forth. Eventually, the fight ends, but at first, it's left ambiguous as to who wins. 

The shuttle comes back, and standing in the field is a figure wearing black robes, his back turned towards the camera and his face shrouded by a hood. 

The camera pans to his face and it's revealed to be the Jedi, disguised as the Sith.

2953,"I really don't like the Bloodline novel, and here's why.","I've repeatedly expressed my opinion of it on SW discord, but it's tiresome to write down my arguments every time, so I'll keep it in one place here.

Bloodline is Claudia Grey's novel focusing on Princess Leia and her decision to form the Resistance. On paper it sounds like a solid premise, and Claudia's Lost Stars book is deservingly praised as one of the best books in new canon, despite (or maybe because of) being a young adult novel. So what could go wrong? Well, in part it's my subjective perception of course, and some I feel is a bit of mishandling of central premise. Let's take a closer look at it.

Ah, right. Spoiler warning for Bloodline. I'll leave it unmarked, since it's been a long time since the book came out and I don't want to have the rest of the post blanked out.

The central conflict in Bloodline is a split in New Republic senate. One faction of Centrists want to institute a Chancellor in the senate with power to break ties and get shit done, as well as keeping the military fleet, while other faction of Populists, to which Princess Leia belongs, want to decentralize the New Republic and ultimately had their sights on disbanding the fleet.

To put it mildly, I disagree with Leia's faction position here. The plot itself is kicked off by Ryloth requesting assistance and investigation from the Senate, because twi'leks get raided by the pirates, and Ryloth position is pretty much exactly example of what Populist faction wanted to implement - mostly self-governed world, looking out for itself with ties to galactic society. And, well, now it needs protection from the Senate and New Republic Fleet, because they're getting raided. This position, if taken to the extreme, is essentially tantamount to breaking up the Republic into confederacy with every planet-state pulling the blanket to itself. Quite frankly, it's medieval way of governing things, just waiting for an Empire to pick systems one by one. And considering that Senate *already* can't agree on anything, getting the senate to coordinate this mess would flat out impossible.

It doesn't help that the position of Centrists - having a Head of State, or ""First Senator"" as they've put it, and keeping robust military is essentially mirrors the structure of New Republic in old Expanded Universe.

So that's one point, but it's not big enough to write a wall of text about, right? Right. Let's continue and see how these factions are portrayed.

The Populists are basically ineffectual. Their only position is ""We won't be like Empire"", and they stick to it to an absurd degree. In their mind having a chancellor with a tiebreaker vote is tantamount to setting up a new Emperor, just because Palpatine weaseled in getting more and more emergency powers. For this they're pretty much committed to just oppose Centrists regardless of what Centrists actually say, since from their point of view a Centrist senate = Empire.

And here comes my main issue with the book.

The Centrists are basically portrayed as the Empire. A token #notallcentrists secondary protagonist collects imperial memorabilia, admires the effective management. But then he comes to realize how many of his colleagues in the party are nostalgic for the Empire and basically think that maybe Palpatine wasn't such a bad chap. Oh, and by the way, the raids on Ryloth? A plot by Centrist sympathisers. Oh, and by the way - Centrists are infiltrated and manipulated by the First Order. So they're Literally The Empire.

The message of Leia being disenchanted in politics somewhat falls flat when it basically boils down to ""Look, our prejudice against Centrists is justified! They All Really Are Imperials!""

And what makes it personal to me, is that this treatment is given to the side that espoused most reasonable way of governing the galactic government and the way it worked in Legends continuity. That to be honest reads as an insult. What am I supposed to conclude from this? That being reasonable is equal to being an evil Imperial or preferring Legends is equal to being an evil Imperial?

I must admit, it's jarring to go from excellent Lost Stars to such a mess of a story in Bloodline. I'm hesitant to pick up Leia Princess of Alderaan now, because I don't know what kind of Claudia Grey is in there.

Now I've heard counter-arguments, sure. Like Populists just want to be like Old Republic... but well, they're not Old Republic, and Old Republic system proved it's flaws already by transforming into Empire. And they're living in a very different galaxy from the Old Republic too. The one where pirates get their hands on Super Star Destroyers. And of course there's subjective issue of being insulted, which won't go away with logic arguments.

So here we are. I don't like Bloodline. I think it's political conflict is mishandled, and since this conflict is major part of the book, it hurts the whole novel by extension.",StarWars,1536051076,Kyle_Dornez,48,14,True,2018-09-04

Probably, yes. But it will manifest as the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. The IP will walk on for a while, seemingly unharmed, then collapse. But the blame should be shared at least as much by JJ Abrams and “The Force Awakens”.
Goodwill towards the IP has been damaged heavily among the core fans. (I don’t consider myself one of them, although I liked the series a lot as a kid, but I see what they write, the videos they post on YouTube etc.) Johnson, Kennedy and others have displayed contempt for this subset of fans, essentially dismissing them as a “basket of deplorables”. This is terrible PR, and it also shows an unwillingness to face up to the very real problems Disney have had with the IP.
Here is a section from investment website “Seeking Alpha” focusing on the absence of any guiding creative vision (comparing the Lucasfilm division with Kevin Feige’s team at Marvel):
“With Star Wars, Disney took a very different approach. Kathleen Kennedy, the head of Lucasfilm, seemed to prefer treating each film in the new trilogy separately, rather than as a single narrative. Thus, the first film was led by director JJ Abrams, but the next film in the trilogy fell to Rian Johnson. Johnson’s decision to scrap many of the narrative threads spun by Abrams proved to be one of the most controversial aspects of The Last Jedi.
When crafting a film that will, virtually of necessity, have considerable cultural importance, changing leadership willy-nilly with little thought to past entries is a recipe for disaster. The original Star Wars films were, for better or worse, guided by a single vision. For investors, thinking about narrative and vision may be a somewhat esoteric subject. But it matters a great deal when those narratives are the bedrock of incredibly valuable IP.”
A common argument dismissing concerns about The Last Jedi is, “The prequels were awful but the IP survived anyway”. Well, the prequels WERE a bit lame, but in a very different way. Their sins were ones of execution, most obviously dialogue and performances. Everything felt stiff, and the romance thread between Anakin and Padme felt very unconvincing. Yet at no point was the core story ever problematic. You could take the core scripts of the prequels, apply a little polish, reshoot some key scenes, and end up with a perfectly respectable trilogy. You can’t really do that with episodes 7 and 8 because the problems run through the scripts at a conceptual level.
The plots don’t make sense as sequel stories to the first six chapters. The single biggest problem is that they retcon the SW narrative universe as one in which good and evil take turns running the galaxy in a never-ending cycle. This is expedient for the setup of Force Awakens, and gets embraced as the core of the plot to Last Jedi. Yet this does not actually correspond with the SW galaxy at all. Palpatine’s rise to power should be seen as the Great Aberration after thousands of years of peace safeguarded by the Jedi. Episode VI was intended to be the point at which the Republic was restored and the aberration is over. Yet this is potentially problematic for making a rip-roaring sequel to Return of the Jedi.
Any plausible story needs to start out in a restored Republic with a new Jedi order in existence. But where do you go from there? Have a story of a new threat growing within the Republic? Imperial loyalists? A new Sith threat? Dark Jedi? Could work, but the feel would probably be rather similar to the prequels. And the prequels are a slightly peculiar beast. They aren’t really about “star wars” very much. Rather, it’s an action-packed mystery story about an invisible threat subverting the Republic from within. Quite ambitious and unusual, but very different in feel from the original trilogy.
So how DO you get back to the feel of the OT? Well, as in the joke about the Irishman giving directions, “I wouldn’t start from here”. So Abrams doesn’t. He simply retcons it and hopes you won’t really notice or care, because you’re enjoying the action, the snappy dialogue and the jokes. The setup for TFA makes very little sense as a continuation of the Star Wars story, because it snaps us back to the functional analogue of the beginning of Episode IV with almost no explanation. The victory in Return of the Jedi was essentially all for nothing. Jakku seems like a worse place to live than anywhere under the Empire (with the possible exception of Alderaan; would have sucked to live there). Luke’s Jedi academy was a failure and he’s a broken man. Somehow the Empire live on with greater weaponry than they ever had before.
For the first time in Star Wars, there is no joined-up thinking. This doesn’t feel like a story written by people thinking about lore, mechanics and continuity. This feels like a story written by people who understand what Star Wars looks like on the surface but none of its internals and complexities. This is a film designed by a focus group. Lucas’s prequels felt clunky but authentic. The sequels feel snappy and vibrant but inauthentic. They don’t really fit the SW universe. And that’s a big problem.
Last Jedi is an over-correction to some of the issues that TFA had. TFA felt like it was designed specifically to retread old ground with old tropes. (This was arguably the first time the series had ever done this; “Jedi” obviously gives us a second Death Star but the plot is very different from that of the original “Star Wars”). Last Jedi wants to go SO far in the other direction that it throws the baby out with the bathwater. It feels like it’s designed to be everything that Star Wars fans DIDN’T want, almost for its own sake, to make a point. You can call this bold, but you can also call it arrogant and self-indulgent. It would be forgivable if Johnson set up a whole slew of interesting new plot threads and ideas, but he doesn’t. In fact, he seems to abandon his iconoclastic mission during the scene aboard Supremacy where Ren simply reverts to type, being an oddly motiveless angry kid, and we get an utterly traditional showdown battle.
And then nothing is set up for the final chapter. No interesting questions, no cliffhangers, nothing unresolved. Other than the aforementioned question of what on earth Kylo Ren actually wants. Are we rooting for him to die? To be saved? What’s at stake? What’s motivating me to see Episode IX?
Finally: Star Wars is a somewhat formulaic franchise. The formula is what makes it successful. It would certainly be bold and subversive for Coca-Cola to start shipping apple juice in their cans, but we should not necessarily applaud them for doing so. And if I were Coca-Cola I would be very wary of dismissing the complaints of Coke fans as coming from people who don’t understand bold visionary moves.

2961,I think it's beautiful how the rift in Star Wars fandom echoes the civil war of the prequel films,"There are heroes on both sides.  The Separatists (Lucas Loyalists) find the Star Wars water well to be poisoned and they wish to bring this to everyone's attention and find freedom and independence from the new era of Star Wars.  The Republic (Disney Devotees) love the classic and/or prequel trilogy as well as the sequel movies.  They are trying to encourage everyone to keep an open mind to the sequels.  They wish to maintain order in the galaxy by defending Star Wars as it currently is.  Even if puts them at odds with long loyal fans who have become disenchanted with the corporate heavy-handedness the series now is (from a certain point of view).


We are literally LARPing (live action role-playing) the civil war of the Republic from the prequel trilogy.  Is this not beautiful?

2963,Finn storyline [SPOILERS],"Finn in TFA and TLJ was in my opinion, a wasted oppurtunity. Finn has such an intriguing backstory and something that we've never seen in Star Wars a bad guy that left the First Order and doesn't want to join the good guys.

In both films Finn repeatedly says that he doesn't want to join the rebellion but ends up joining amyways why he does this idk. Also Finn seems to be a little psychotic, in TFA it is revealed the first order storm troopers are brain washed and not truly evil, but shortly after Finn returns from the massacre he instantly starts to murder his well... practically his brothers and he seems to be utterly remorseless it would have been cool in my opinion if he didn't join the rebellion and would try and rescue other storms troopers.

That's my thoughts on Finn, also it is kind of sad now that I think about it when the resistance kills storm troopers now because they are all brainwashed what do you guys think?",StarWars,1536075599,Hurtfulfriend0,23,16,True,2018-09-04

2969,An interesting thought I had while rewatching the prequels that I haven't seen many people discuss before.,"Much of the prequel movies feel like I'm watching a live play rather than a movie. The dialogue is more regal in the prequels and the acting feels like something you'd see in a play rather than a film. This was a deliberate choice by George (in the BTS docs of the prequels he often says how galaxy at the time of the prequel-era was more Shakespearean) but his awkward scripts and the sometimes weak chemistry between actors really reinforce this, so in a weird way, George's weaknesses helped him achieve his goal.

Even the way the movies are shot feels very thespian, especially during talking scenes. The cameras are almost always stationary and never move around exploring the sets, and the variety of camera shots George uses is quite limited. I guess most of the sets being on a green-screen really limited how creative George could get with his camera angles and movements, turning locations into simple backdrops for the actors to perform against, just like a set in a play.

Anyone else ever noticed this? The talking scenes definitely feel like something you see in a theatre and there could be a live audience just behind the camera.",StarWars,1536091561,Mamsies,43,26,True,2018-09-04

In TFA, the First Order is a new Imperial regime, but they're not controlling everything.  They successfully plunge the galaxy into a chaotic state by atomizing the New Republic's capital system, but they're not the dominant regime at the beginning of the film.  And in TLJ, they are in the process of conquering the galaxy, but their ability to actually RULE the galaxy is called into question because they have a lunatic in charge (Kylo Ren), and they have to deal with a galaxy that is ready to fight back (because of Luke's heroic sacrifice).  So they aren't going to be sitting in power for decades like the Empire did. 

The way I see it, in the end, the ST will be about how the galaxy ALMOST descended back into tyrannical rule, but it was prevented because new heroes -- heroes who were inspired by the OT heroes -- rose up and protected what the OT heroes fought for.",StarWars,1536157306,TheFiveStarMan,67,2,True,2018-09-05

In that teaser, Luke talks about his family having the force - the only dialogue we get from Mark Hamill for TFA: 

""The force is strong in my family. My father has it, I have it, my sister has it. You have that power too.""

Why else would Rian Johnson go out of his way to do this, if not to make Rey a Skywalker on the sly?

So having just read the [Darth Jar Jar theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/duplicates/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/), I feel like I should just share what I believe would be a great way to reveal Darth Jar Jar to the audience. I noticed the Darth Jar Jar concept is VERY similar to a character from a show I recently got into, the anime Naruto Shippuden. Yes it's an anime but bear with me. 

So the character that mirrors Jar Jar Binks is named Tobi, another bumbling, seemingly weak and inconsequential fool amongst a strong organisation. [Here's an example of that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYB6YjMQT8g) The character is then later revealed to be one of the strongest and most influential figure in the history of the series. [Here is the scene reveal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q0it0ELaIo) Just imagine the orange hair dude as Palpatine, discussing with a mysterious hooded figure with dark voice and articulate speech, then to only slowly be revealed to be none other than Jar Jar Binks! The audience is eased in to the reveal and it somehow makes it feel less of an asspull than a sudden reveal.

I just think that the concept of these two characters are too similar and the way the Tobi reveal scene is handled would work really well with Darth Jar Jar in TPM.

Would these books have even been something the PT Jedi didn't even know about because if they did, do you really think they would of the left the books there and not archive them or something like that? but no, this planet that Luke had to search for and hunt down somehow modern information on it?  


That would be like someone finding the lost city of El Dorado and they find a book that talks about 9/11 and the events of war on terrorism and we use that information to dismantle our government since the book shows the Jedi order in a bad light, it must be bad or maybe the books were written by someone who saw the Jedi in a bad way and wanted to make them look bad.

3009,A Droid Movie,"It may sound a bit strange but I would love a film that is centered around a droid in the same format of the film Paulie. Yes the one about the parrot.

It could start sometime in the Prequel era and due to the main character being a droid, take us on a trip though that era to the OT time period all the way into the Sequels. Perhaps have the droid belong to a family or a child and have it try and find it's way back or find them after losing them in the Clone Wars. Maybe have the end be finding the grandchild of the family and taking care of them.

This could be a film that finally takes all elements from every Star Wars film and mixes them all together, connecting everything. I don't want it to be too cute with it though, it doesn't need the droid becoming Star Wars Forrest Gump. We don't need it at every important event in every movie.

But it would be fun to perhaps bump into a few characters here and there and maybe be in the background for one important event.

Not sure what type of droid, probably some new type of droid made up for the movie, but likely not an R2, Protocol droid, or assassin or combat droid.

Heck, this could be a CGI movie. Bring a few people over from Pixar or Disney animation to really give it a quality boost. Maybe even make it a cooperative picture where Disney actually makes the movie.

This would have appeal to kids and adults while also escaping the formula of just making a anthology movie about an established character. It would still have heavy grounding in Star Wars lore though and give people who love all three eras something to enjoy.

3011,[Not a Rant]Thinking about the beginning of Episode VIII,"This doesn't necessarily want to be a ""fix"", it's just a thought that keeps comng up in my head whenever I get to talk about the movie, and since I like talking about Star Wars let me know what do you think about it.  
When Rose's sister falls to the base platform of the bomber, losing the remote for the release of the bombs. What if...  
  
She kicks the metal framework once, twice, the remote seems it's falling down to her hand but, instead of conveniently falling into her grasps it just sits there, out of reach.  
She reaches for her medallion with her left hand, the right one toward the remote. She starts chanting:  
  
""I am one with the Force. The Force is with me.  
I am one with the Force, the Force is with me.""  
  
The remote starts shaking. Her eyes widens. She can't believe it's working and keeps going.  
  
""I am one with the Force, the Force is with me!""  
  
The remote tilts over the ledge and falls to her hand.  
She presses the button.  
The rest unfolds as we know.  
  
I think this would reinforce the tone of the ""Force being again into everybody"" from the get go, and it would raise some questions about the Force as a cult, with the chant Chirrut was repeating to himself in Rogue One.

However, in rebels they look far more similar to eachother, instead looking much closer to Phase 2 helmets; Both of them having the same Phase 2 mouthpieces (despite completely different in CW) and Wolffe completely losing the smooth helmet front his CW counterpart had &amp; shared with BARC troopers.

I get that Rebels has an overall more accurate aesthetic to the movies when it comes to armour (e.g. the Phase 1 helmet looking practically identical to that seen in AOTC), but this can't be due to the aesthetic change from CW to Rebels, because we already saw Phase 2 troopers in CW and we could see how different Rex &amp; Wolffe looked to them.

I was wondering if there's any canon reason for this, or if anybody knows if I'm completely mistaken. These are the kind of nitpicky things that bug me, so I'd love to be directed to some piece of canon that explains the change, or to be completely proven wrong! :D",StarWars,1536182412,RubbishSpeakers,7,0,True,2018-09-05
3014,If Sequel Trilogy was done in the style of the MCU," Here is my hypothetical pitch for the Sequel Trilogy done under a Feige, long plan, MCU style.  Instead of Avengers, there will be “Episodes” 7, 8, and 9, with other smaller focused films that tie into the Episodes, which will be called “Stand Alones.”  This is meant to be a fun thought experiment and not meant to criticize the franchise in anyway.  This was inspired by the San Diego Sabers Podcast about Star Wars and the MCU.

**Stand Alone #1** **- Finn and the First Order** \- Finn origin story that coincides with character development for Hux, Phasma, and the other troopers.  Genre - psychological thriller based on Finn slowly discovering the “dark side” behind the First Order.  End Credit - Kylo Ren and Snoke introduced

**Stand Alone #2 - Poe and the Rebellion** \- Poe origin story that coincides with galactic politics and the rising threat of the First Order.  Audience is updated to Leia and Han’s current situation. Genre - Action packed battles and high stakes politics. End Credit #1 - Rey End Credit #2 - Luke.

**Episode 7 - Force Awakens** \- This would follow much of the Force Awakens, with the exception that it ends with horrific genocide and destruction from the First Order (who is still finalizing Star Killer Base). Genre - Classic Star Wars. End Credit - Rey hears Luke’s voice.

**Stand Alone #3 - Rey** \- This would be Rey’s quest to find Luke.  She would start with friends but due to threats from the first order and other fun evil dangers, she would have to face the worst perils alone on her quest to find Luke.  She gets to Luke and begins her training. Genre - Buddy Quest/Mythic Quest. End Credit - Snoke’s plans/or origins.

**Stand Alone #4 - Kylo** \- This would be a mix of Kylo’s current struggles with identity and meaning along with flashbacks of his training and falling out with Luke. Daddy and Mommy issues galore. Genre - Suspense and Paranoia. End Credit - Ahsoka.

**Episode 8 - Last Jedi** \- Rey is almost done with her training, but force skypes with Kylo so rushes to go turn him to the light.  Finn and the Rebels, including Rose start to win some small battles and plan on destroying the StarKiller Base.  They face some betrayal from allies/spies etc.  Rey ends up defeating Kylo, Snoke is dead, and Rey and the rebels destroy Starkiller Base. Genre - Star Wars End Credit - Ahsoka.

**Stand Alone #5 - Finn and Rose** \- They need to get some information or spy or hacker or whatever, and go on a mission to a Coruscant and Canto Byte to get what they need.  All the while, Rose goes off on social inequality and injustice and Finn slowly learns to agree with her and fall in love.  They also discover other force sensitives who like clean floors. Genre - Romance. End Credit - Outer Regions.

**Stand Alone #6 - Rey and Poe** \- They both have different visions of finishing off the First Order - they both have pros and cons.  They both struggle to be a leader without trying to take the full responsibility of the Rebellion.  The Rebellion is stronger and seems to have the First Order Running, but they struggle with Snoke’s previously laid traps, manipulations, and scheming that keeps setting them back. Genre - Buddy / Action. End Credit - Kylo is losing his shit trying to run the First Order.

**Episode 8** \- Snoke had a heretofore unknown alien warlike civilization from the Outer Regions or another galaxy or something on the backburner this whole time and Kylo discovers them and shit goes down for the Rebellion.  Rey begs Luke, he refuses to help, she discovers Ahsoka, they fight hard and win - killing Kylo - with the help of Luke’s Force Projection who taunts Kylo like a mean uncle.  Luke becomes one with the force.  Genre - Star Wars. End Credit #1 - Finn and Rose get married and adopt broom boy. End Credit #2 - Poe becomes leader of the new Senate or Space Force or something. End Credit #3 - Rey and Ahsoka create a new Grayish Jedi Temple that is Sith Friendly.

**Network Television Show Throughout -** **Agents of the Rebellion** \- Starring Carrie Fisher’s Daughter, BB8, Ackbar, and other sundry rebels.

**Netflix Shows:**

**Cantobyte** \- Gangster Genre with bounty hunters, crime lords, and war profiteers. 

**Droids** \- A.I. Thriller on a planet struggling to stay neutral in the current star war.

**Force Sensitives** \- A small planet in the outer regions has a connection to the force, and the inhabitants are starting to discover amazing powers that disrupt their current way of life and cause fear in those who don’t have the powers (ala X-Men).

**Stars and Struggles** \- Bring all three Netflix shows together in one complicated trade/runaway/betrayal story.

3015,"Theory: Ben ""Lies""","One of the repeating patterns in Star Wars could easily be that a character named ""Ben"" will lie about the protagonist's parentage. 

Kylo Ren AKA ""Ben Solo"" is most likely somewhat lying about Rey's parentage. Later, he'll probably say something along the lines of ""it's true from a certain point of view"". 

If Disney intends to reveal a twist in episode 9 , then it would make sense to mislead the audience beforehand in order to help that twist register with a majority of the audience. 

In a lot of ways, The Last Jedi was a red herring for what is to come. Rian Johnson knew he would most likely be hated by many of the fans because he was kinda hired to do that exact thing and it clearly influenced his decision making during the making of TLJ.

3017,What do people mean when they say Legends has a complicated and hard to follow timeline?,"This one majorly confuses me. For starters at the front of every novel is a nice two page spread that has the timeline of books from back in the Old Republic era all the way to Fate. And if its a newer reprint of the book it will even have a updated timeline of the books. So you just have to look at that timeline to see where the book falls in the Star Wars universe. Just like you do in the new books. 

Same for the comics (in fact that comics in Legends are a bit more specific about the date than the NEU is) which has a nice timeline starting all the way back in the old Dark Horse stuff showing you where it goes. 

Plus now we have something that I didn't have untill HS which is wookieepedia and its nice timeline of both legends and canon books and comics that people can look at. 

So how it that a complicated or hard to follow timeline?

If people are saying this when they really just mean that their are to many books for them to read then they better already be caught up to the NEU books because their are already about 30 novels not counting some things like Join the Resistance. 

Or do they mean its confusing going into a series and accidentally picking up the second book and reading it first? Becuase I have done that despite it saying ""Book 2 of the Black Fleet Crisis"" on front of my copy of Shield of Lies",StarWars,1536186665,roninjedi,23,2,True,2018-09-05
3018,Padme and Galactic Conflicts,"I do not know if it would have mattered or not, but it seems to me that Padme was  the catalyst for causing the Palpatines acension into the chancellorship and the indirect cause of the clone wars and said escalation. If we look we see that it was her proposal for a vote of no confidence that elevated palpatine. Her quest for a peace also allowed for an escalation during the Separatist Crisis as her attempted assassination due to her vocal opinions on the mattee that led to the Jedi discovering the clone army which then allowed the republic to further militarize. And do not forget during the Clone Wars in which she attempted to open peace talks with Mina Bonteri the discovery of which led to Bonteri's death at the hand of Dooku's henchmen which crushed any attempt for peace and made things worse. It was also her loyalist committee and petition of systems to the chancellor which allowed the seeds of rebellion to sowed in the waning days of the republic. 

I just feel like had Padme not been such a pacifist or selfish about her people and had thought about the larger ramifications of what she was doing maybe things would not have progressed so quickly as they did or escalated to such levels.

3029,How I would fix the First Order,"At the moment we have no idea how the First Order came to be, who Snoke was and what their intentions really are. For my own sanity watching the sequels, this is how I would fix some of the bigger holes. 

So to begin.... The First Order was not always an army. It began as an organisation which specialised in healing or repairing dying planets. This organisation was created and run by Snoke, who being force sensitive, has similar gifts as Anakin Skywalker in terms of building/creating technology. 
The labour force behind Snokes “planet repair” company would be child slaves, like Finn, taken and brainwashed to perform manual labour. Although the Galaxy would not agree with this method, they overlook it because Snoke is saving the homes of billions of species. (and as we know from TLJ, there’s a lot of child slave labour in the Galaxy).

Snoke, although incredibly force sensitive, doesn’t really know what the force is. That is until he meets Ben Solo, who now hates the Jedi, and tells Snoke all about the dark side and the Old Empire. Snoke already has immense wealth and power from his organisation and now that Ben has romanticised the dark side, he starts to crave more. Together they begin to turn the labour force into an army to emulate the old empire. 
Snoke uses his existing planet repair technology to turn a dead, unused planet into Star Killer base where they recruit Hux to oversee the conversion of slaves from labour to army. 

As this army is new and hasn’t really done anything to consider itself a threat to the republic so they have no real opposition. 
Leia senses the dark side building so hurriedly puts together a rebel alliance. She can’t get that many allies as no one is really convinced that the First Order is anything to worry about. 

This, to me, would explain how the First Order is so rich but so disorganised and clumsy. It would also explain why they’re so similar to the Old Empire and why there’s such a small rebel army. 

Anyway, that’s just the back story I created to be able to enjoy the sequels. It doesn’t fill every hole, but a few of the main ones. I’d be interested to know how you would fix it, or if you even think it needs fixing.

What if the Nebulon B's we see the rebels using in Episode 6 and elsewhere are severely stripped down? It's often been observed that the thin spine of the Nebulon B frigate seems like a glaring weak spot. What if the Nebulon B is really just the ""spine"" of a modular warship system? Maybe weapon and hangar modules are supposed to go around the spine and behind the ""hatchet"" section? Maybe the plating seen on the sides of the ""hatchet"" section are the remnants of armor plating which has been stripped away? Perhaps some Nebulon B's owned by the Empire were stripped down, decommissioned, then sold to civilians? The rebels would still want to get their hands on a ship with over-built military grade navigation and power systems. As with the Y-Wings, perhaps the greater speed and maneuverability of the  stripped-down configuration actually suited the rebel's hit and run tactics even better?",StarWars,1536203053,stcredzero,3,1,True,2018-09-05

Plus in Solo, Maul runs Crimson Dawn. While in SWR, he pretty much has nothing as result of ""the Sith"", saying they ""took everything"" from him. This could be him *just* refrencing what happened in TCW but more than likely also his authority over the criminal underworld as well.

My theory is that the Empire finds out about Maul so the Emperor sends Vader in to take care of him. I believe Vader will find and annihilate both Maul and his entire criminal faction. This inevitably leaves Maul stranded on Malachor somehow.

Continuing the theme of ""rag tag and deniable"" their starfighter compliment is a hand full of X-wings and one A-wing, wouldn't it have been more efficient and ""logical"" to stick with something along the lines of the B-Wing as the Resistance bombers.

When the insects swarm Vader he could simply force push them away, easy mode, instead he gets covered in the stone stuff and nearly incapacitated. 

I’m genuinely confused as to why Vader seems like a tactical fool and why he seems weak.

There is one part of the book where Vader questions if the Emperor has told Thrawn who he is and he decides that the Emperor would not do him dirty. Why would Vader have any cause to trusts Palps, he’s a Sith Lord and on top of that is always testing Vader and putting him in dangerous situations.

3057,Ashoka's Duel with Maul Better be Good,"With anyone who doesn't already know, the TV show Starwars: The Clone Wars is being brought back for another season. In this season, it's been revealed that it will take place directly before the events of Revenge of the Sith, and that there will be more storyline surrounding Ashoka and Maul. From the two characters' first interaction in Starwars: Rebels, Ashoka and Maul have some history, which is expected to be expanded upon in this last season. Part of their history is going to include a climactic duel towards the end of the series. This post is going to detail my hopes for how their duel is going to go down. As a disclaimer, I'm not a profession by any means, just a fan that wishes for the best.

First and foremost, the fight should resemble the duel between Obiwan and Quigon against Maul in The Phantom Menace. This includes the entirety of (or atleast most of) the fight being isolated from the rest of the battle. That way, there are no distractions and no one can be miraculously saved from being finished (even though the audience already knows that neither will die in this battle). Another item that this duel should have that was a part the duel from The Phantom Menace should be the acrobatics, considering that we have two of the fastest, most nimble force wielders in the entirety of starwars duking it out. Also, the music score to this duel should be very, very reminiscent of the Duel of the Fates, as I would say this duel as almost as much relevance. 

The second big thing with this fight should be the cinematography. I'm fully aware that Dave Filoni (the director) and the rest of the crew is fully capable of making not only an entertaining scene, but also a beautiful one; these are just other desires that I have when it comes to this fight. There should be a combination of locations that are close quarters and open spaces. By this I mean there should be areas that the camera shot is close to the characters, like in a hallway, with their sabers hitting the sides of the walls creating millions of sparks, and also shots that are wide, showing the entirety of the space around Ashoka and Maul. 

Thirdly, the action. As mentioned before, there should be lots of acrobatic stunts and the fight as a whole should be fast paced. Preferably, there would be sequences in which Ashoka and Maul would have to trade some punches, as they're not only acrobat aficionados but also professional martial artists. Also, even though Ashoka is very capable in combat for her age, it should still be shown how formidable Maul is, considering the fact that hes been able to slay Quigon and Pre Visla. The scene could do this by showing Ashoka being on the defense for much of the duel, in the same way that Obiwan was mostly moving away from Anakin during their Mustafar fight. I don't have a preference who ""wins"" the duel, as I love both characters to the bone and they will both survive anyway. Actually, it should be more unclear who won, to give the sense that it is unfinished, and that their meeting in Rebels finishes it.

However this duel between Ashoka and Maul turns out, it will be one of the most memorable scenes in all of this franchise, and will be one of my favorite Starwars moments. Everything mentioned is only what I would like to see in this duel and I'm sure that Dave and the crew will do a fantastic job regardless.

3058,Dr. Evil As The Real Death Star Creator?,"(bare with me and fake laugh if you have to)

So in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Dr. Evil was planning on putting a ""laser"" on the moon or as he called it, his ""Death Star"". Funny, but then I remembered something. At that time of the planning of his ""Death Star"", he was in 1969. A New Hope didn't come out until 1977. Soooooo.....I got to thinking:

Was George Lucas one of Dr. Evil minions that got out the game and took this idea to make a movie?

Or did Dr. Evil really created the ""Death Star"" and it's a shared universe?

He's finally defeated Dooku and is now being told that he has a seat on the Jedi council, but is a not a master. Anakin's biggest and most obvious flaw was his anger, and general expression of emotions really. If Anakin had remained calm, both mentally and physically (so essentially if he clearly wasn't enraged)  what are the chances that he would have been made a master right there on the spot? With everything he's done in the war he clearly posses the skills of a master the only thing he's missing is the emotional maturity. So what better finale test to give him than possibly the ultimate insult. If calmer Anakin prevailed would he have been made a master? Thoughts?

3070,Can we take a moment to appreciate Lucasfilm for making sure Solo was fully realized despite the fact that it was shot twice.,"I just wanted to acknowledge that a movie like Solo which despite being basically shot twice did not have it’s quality compromised. Everything that could go wrong with this movie did go wrong and yet Lucasfilm did not throw in the towel and release a version which they knew would be unfaithful to the character. They instead put a stop to production, even if it was late in the schedule, decided to reverse course and were willing to put in as much work as needed to create a film that would live up to Lucas’ legacy.

They went back to practical locations like Vandor, instead of shooting those scenes on a green screen. A lot of studios see there vision failing and decide to half-ass the rest to deliver something that barely passes off as a film. Take Justice League for example, I was so excited for that film and WB made the switch to Whedon and reshot half of it. But the difference was they completely destroyed any cohesiveness the film may have had. Some shots were filmed practically whereas the reshoots were clearly on a green screen. Tonally it kept shifting between Whedon’s light romp to Snyder’s darker aesthetic. And they did this all so they could meet a deadline and deliver a product which would give the producers short-term gains to their pocketbooks while ignoring the long-term impact on the brand.

Everyone has differing opinions on these new Star Wars films, as they should, but one thing I think we can agree on is that Lucasfilm will not allow the vision they set forth to be compromised and be half-assed. From the production troubles particularly on Rogue One and Solo we have gotten films which only add to the Star Wars saga. There’s a reason Lucas was willing to pass on the torch to the current leadership group at Lucasfilm, because he knew they would always respect and revere the property. He handpicked the people in charge and despite production issues they have had behind the scenes and reception to some films do to choices they felt were right, they have always shown respect for the brand and are unwilling to let it be compromised like other studios have with their properties.

3077,How much training a Jedi needs.,The prequel era Jedi trained for years so they could control the force they tried to possess it.   That is what Luke is talking about in the last jedi. The first words of jedi training Luke heard from Obi wan are the most important in understanding the force “you must let go your conscious self and act on instinct.” Yoda and Obi wan know the Jedi order was wrong and they don’t train luke the same way they trained padawans. Nearly everything yoda tries to teach Luke contradicts the Jedi training of the prequel era.  Every lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader is just as much a mental fight as it is a physical one. It’s only when Vader gets into his head and forgets to let the force flow through him that he begins to fail. The truest Jedi is only a conduit of the force allowing the will of the force to act through them. Qui Gon is the example  we get of the truest Jedi in the movies.  Rey is able  let go of her conscious self very easily because like Kylo says she is nothing and her time alone on Jakku has forced her to act on instinct to survive. When she lets the force in she is able to do miraculous things. The force guides your actions through instinct if you let it. ,StarWars,1533391838,Mediocre_Scott,54,43,True,2018-08-04

I'm talking about the scene where they all go to the Imperial Research Base to rescue Jyn's father,he dies,and the Rebels blown everything up. Does this scene seem out of place to anyone else? And unnecessary? We JUST had the(much better)scene of Jyn and her father's hologram on Jedha....they had already said all they needed to say and...then we get a repeat of that exact scene? Granted,it offers some plot development when we see that Cassian is planning to assassinate Jyn's father,but we already knew he was a morally compromised agent for the rebellion by the way he killed his contact in the opening scene. 

I dont know...I feel like that whole bit might have worked better if the Rebels had headed for the Rebel base after Jedha and tried to get support for the raid on Scariff. Meanwhile,they could have shown Krennic assassinating the other scientists until Galen cracked and admitted what he had done,and then had Krennic assassinate him and head for Scariff to intercept the Rebels.

Why do I prefer the prequels over the trilogy and new trilogy? 

Well the new trilogy is y'know. 

So why do I prefer it over the trilogy? 

Because it brought life into the series.

See the original trilogy panned luke as the ""last jedi"" and made him seem like some kind of superhero rather then the Jedi shown in the prequels. 

I love the (two) prequels (I didn't like phantom) because they made the universe feel big, they made the Jedi out to be some sort of Police Monk order, rather then superpowered beings. I liked the idea that anybody can be a Jedi and that they were in this never-ending battle against evil that's lasted centuries and you had Betrayal and tragedy 
But you had all these planets to explore too. Whereas the original trilogy doesn't really capture that. 
instead it focuses on luke and his story. Whereas I mentioned the prequels focus on the whole Jedi order, it's not about obi-wan or anakin, (the third movie technically is) but the prequels made the Jedi into something more then what the original trilogy did. 
it gave obi-wan a backstory, it made us see the downfall of anakin. 

Furthermore, In the original trilogy we barely got to see any other race but human, but in the prequels we saw tons of alien races. 
and it really made the Feeling of being a Jedi more special. Albeit it less unique but still special nonetheless. 

And as the tv shows set during the galactic republic era have proven, the setting works. Why? Because the universe is full of life! Whereas in the original trilogy it all feels dead or the sith rule everything. 

I don't understand all the hate AOTC  and Revenge of the sith get. (I totally get phantom). The stories are excellent and cinematography is top notch.

3098,Seeking ideas on finding a new home for my EU book collection,"Hello all. I’m presently facing a dilemma, and I’d like to seek your collective opinion on the best way to solve it.

(For the record, even though I’ve been reading Reddit for years, this is the first time I’ve ever posted anything. Please go easy on me if I’ve overlooked something important!)

Anyway, during my twenties I began a collection of paperback novels from the old EU. In time, it grew to include nearly every single published adult Star Wars novel, as well as all of the published short story compendiums.

This month, though, I’ll be moving, and in the process of packing I’ve decided to shed a number of belongings which I no longer actively use. One of the things I’ve decided to let go of is – you guessed it – the aforementioned collection.

My original idea was to sell them to a local shop, but given the affection I feel for these books that seems like a horribly impersonal thing to do. (Not to mention that the return would be abysmal anyway.) I know that I could just donate them to one of the libraries in the area, but that again seems like a way too ignominious end for something that I spent the greater part of a decade building.

What I’d really like to do is gift them to some young Star Wars fan, both to ensure that they find a good home and to encourage a future generation of fans to enjoy what I’ve come to love so much. I’ve asked around amongst my friends and colleagues, and there have been no takers.

That’s where you all come in. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to give away these novels while still “protecting the Light,” so to speak? I’m not looking for money here – I’d be perfectly happy to send them anywhere for just the cost of shipping.

Please let me know what you think. All ideas are welcome!

By the way, here’s some info on what’s included:

-130 paperback books total, all in excellent condition
-124 full-length novels (too many to list)
-2 novel compilations (The Han Solo Adventures, The Lando Calrissian Adventures)
-4 short story compendiums (Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, Tales from Jabba’s Palace, Tales from the Empire)

Not included are the most recently published EU works (Dawn of the Jedi, the Lost Tribe of the Sith collection, Maul: Lockdown, Kenobi, the Empire and Rebellion duology, and Crucible), the Old Republic game tie-in novels (Revan, Deceived, Fatal Alliance, and Annihilation), the Darth Bane trilogy, the Episode III novelization, and the Thrawn trilogy.",StarWars,1533409526,theschwartzofcourse,3,1,True,2018-08-04

3101,[TLJ spoilers] What I think about the hyperspeed scene,"Generally I've seen quite a few points made about how the scene in TLJ breaks hyperspace in the in-universe and the consistency, and wonder how hyperspace was not weaponized beforehand. 

But here's what I think happened; Hyperspace has a buildup of speed before the wormhole or whatever is opened up. There's also a certain distance a ship moves before being transported to a different location.

So the sheep ramming into the first order vessel was actually just going at a really fuckin fast speed and not going at hyperspace. Basically a giant missile.
The reason this wasn't done before was;
The lack of easy to hit targets; How do you hit a medium sized ship doing weird manouvres with a mid sized ship going at 2000km an hour? Also you're very vulnerable to being destroyed as you take aim.

All of these point to why hyperspace was not used, and why ramming at high speeds is quite rare.

In Episode 2, Anakin's journey, so to speak is interesting that never took notice until now.

The darkside wasn't his fall, but the loss, worrying, and most importantly, his emotions/ feelings toward his mother was.

I can't imagine how Anakin must of felt for not seeing his mother for a long time. Yet, being training to be a Jedi. 

Wado though, kind of unfortunate for him to sell Anakin's mom due to debts he had to pay.

Few times during the movie, the music mimicks Darth Vader music. Which I never took notice of it. Not until now.

I appreciate any suggestions and feedback.

-Doctor friend continues to care for him and keep his identity a secret, as news comes to light that Mace Windu is the most wanted man on the planet.

-Eventually, clones storm the hospital because they've had an anonymous tip off.

-The doctor friend manages to secure Mace Windu an escape off of the planet, with a change of clothes and a little bit of money. He is rushed out of the hospital from the back door, barely escaping at the last moment and just about avoids capture. He still also only has one hand.

-A very injured Mace Windu finds himself staying on a remote, mountainous, snowy planet, where locals live in caves.

-He tries to make contact with the jedi, with many failed attempts.

-Eventually, he discovers that all of the jedi have been killed and are now an enemy of the republic

3123,I'd love to see Joel McNeely come back to Star Wars and score a film,"I absolutely loved the soundtrack to Solo. It felt fresh and modern, while pulling from Williams enough to make it feel part of the family. I absolutely enjoyed the themes in it, and the way Powell arranged William's Han theme was fantastic. Rogue One was a really good soundtrack, we even got a brand new theme for the damn Imperials. How cool is that?? 

People seem to like Gordy Haab, the composer for the most recent Battlefront games. While the orchestration is completely on point, there's a lot of color and thematic structure missing. It's hard to put my finger on it, but after awhile I got tired of the music and put my own Star War spotify music on in the background. It's really well done, but it's also \*very\* safe and I think that hurts the overall quality keeps it from being evergreen. 

To me, McNeely is the one composer that has just gotten it perfectly \*right\* though. Shadows of the Empire is an incredible soundtrack that expands on the  Star Warsian sound in a way that completely nails the atmosphere. It's weird, it's bright, it's snapping at the seems with themes and motifs to feed your Star Wars hunger. McNeely was personally recommended to Lucasfilm to do the soundtrack for the series, and I believe he is the only composer to be recommended by the maestro in such a way. He's still working to this day, and it would make me so happy for him to get his own movie, considering how the Star Wars brand needs to a new composer to lead the charge into the post-Skywalker era of Star Wars. I definitely wouldn't mind to see Powell and Giacchinno come back either, because I think they've earned it. What do you guys think?

3159,You don’t want a Stand Alone Obiwan film with Ewan Mcgregor!,"You don’t want a Stand Alone Obiwan Film and here’s why. 

Let me start by saying that Obi-wan is my favorite Star Wars character. Ever since Ewan Mcgregor had a voice line in the force awakens, I had hope for him to do a stand alone film. Personally I have enjoyed the anthology films more than the sequel Skywalker saga movies (is it even about the skywalkers anymore? Only Ben solo is left). Anyways I began to do what any fan does, create story options that I would love to see. That’s where I ran into issues. If Ewan McGregor is to stay Obiwan (No one else should even think about getting the role), his age now would be best used as Obiwan after ROTS. Except what kind of story is even there? Obiwan can’t leave Tatooine, let alone engage in some adventures while on the planet. He is in exile with the sole purpose of protecting Luke, what he believes to be the last hope for the Jedi. There’s NOTHING else more important to him than that, so he wouldn’t just abandon Luke even temporarily to go do something else. 

Well with that idea out, I thought about a clone wars live movie, well there’s already a good TV show during that time coming back, and a live action movie with Obiwan during then without Anakin seems pretty odd, and adding any familiar characters from that area would make it “Episode 2.5” 

The last idea I had was young Obiwan, maybe like the recent Han Solo film. But that wouldn’t work either, because Ewan has aged since he’s done episode one, and again we can’t have anyone else play Obiwan! If Qui Gönn was in the story, they would have to get a new actor for him as well. I don’t think Liam Neeson would want to act, as he said he has given up acting in action movies. So overall I think Disney and Lucasfilm is stuck as far as making an Obiwan film. As much as I want a movie about my favorite character, I don’t want something forced and am willing to just let Obiwan’s story be as it is. ",StarWars,1533486811,MountainMan7B,0,1,True,2018-08-05

As someone who considers himself somewhat of a classical liberal, technically on the right, I responded to it, but the post gave me and idea.

Talking strictly about the politics of the movie, not the ideolgies any particular person involved in it, people mostly seem to complain about a few points when they say that the movie is too political: Holdo's treatment of Poe, Rey's ""win"" over Luke in their little fight, the Canto Bight talk about the ""evil rich war-mongers"" and the animal rights thing with the horses. No matter what you think of those points, they obviously are something that resonates with people in this political climate.

But then I imagined ANH being released today. Try to think about it and ignore anything you know about Star Wars now. It's a movie about basically a group of terrorists that are working on overthrowing the goverment, that are portrayed as the good guys despite killing millions in the DS attack. There is also the fact that a very few women play in it.

Also, things that would resonate with people today. Do you thing if the movie was released today, would the more ""extreme"" parts of the spectrum complain about it being ""too political"" to the extend people critised the suppossed political agenda of TLJ?

I'm asking this from a politically neutral perspective and don't mean to comment on the suppossed politics of TLJ, I'm just interested in your opinion on the idea of ANH being released today.

It has been a massive part of my life ever since I was a child, and coming to this point has been tough for me in recent months. With my own opinions on the current state of things and the negativity in the fanbase, I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels some kind of frustration right now. We all have been, in some way.

So I ask you all: say something you love about Star Wars, and without mentioning TLJ. You can hate it, you can love it... but we're a fanbase divided because of it, and for the worst. Instead, I want to focus on why we loved Star Wars to begin with: a sequence, a camera shot, a piece of music, the character, the themes, even the fanbase... tell me something here so we can all remember those things!

For me: I love the effect Star Wars has had on not just modern movies, but in audiences returning to classic films and other works that influenced it. Movies like Seven Samurai and The Hidden Fortress have become some of my favorites as I've grown older, and even having Star Wars being a topical discussion in my classes while reading The Hero of a Thousand Faces is incredible!

Thrawn is next on my list. I've read all these in about 4 months which is completely out of the ordinary for me!

Part of the reason I thought i would enjoy reading was that it would fill in gaps in the stories, but I've kept reading for much more. The universe is so captivating and finding intricate details about characters is so intriguing. I can't get enough! I'm to the point now where I'm legitimately concerned with running out of material in a year or so. I'm considering diving into the legends at that point for some fun stories.

3192,[Thrawn: Alliances Spoilers] I believe Snoke is the threat from the unknown regions revealed in Alliances.,"This threat of course is the Grysk species, I just didn't want to put spoilers in the title. I know it's not actually against any rule, just thought I would be courteous since the book just released recently.

In Alliances, Thrawn and Vader are sent to the edge of the unknown regions to investigate a new ""disturbance in the Force"" which was sensed by Palpatine. Over the course of the book they discover a previously undocumented (by the Empire) species named the Grysk, which are revealed to be a warmongering species hellbent on domination of others.  Previously, they have stuck to the Unknown Regions, though they do have an apparent desire to invade Republic space. Several hints were dropped by Zahn during the book as to what they have been up to over the course of the saga, and I believe some of these things line up with what we know of Snoke. 

Here is what we know of the Grysk:

They have been observing the Republic and Empire since sometime before the Clone Wars. 

They possibly know that  Palpatine manipulated both sides of the war in the Clone Wars, since they gave cortosis to Dooku and watched him build both Clone armor suits and Battle Droids with it. 

They could be nomadic. Thrawn doesn’t believe it, but either way it still tells us that the Grysk likely travel in vast fleets, even if their home planet exists somewhere. 

Like I stated before, they have a clear desire to invade Imperial space. Thrawn delays them after the battle over Mokivj and that apparently prompts them to invade the Chiss Ascendancy first. This would push their invasion of Imperial space back until well into the New Republic era.

Now how does Supreme Leader Snoke fit in? In the TFA novelization, he says that he watched the rise and Fall of the Empire, as well as the birth of the New Republic. Also, if we assume this theory is true, and Snoke IS a Grysk, their species will have made contact with Vader and seen him in action. This combined with dutiful observation could be the reason for Snoke (and Kylo’s) obsession with Vader. In TLJ, Snoke is angry at Kylo because he trained him to be a successor to Vader, yet Kylo has failed him after the events of TLJ. A lot of people ask why Snoke observed for so long without making a move, and him being a Grysk would also partially offer an explanation. The Grysk DID make a move (two actually). The first one was when they tried to turn Dooku and the Seperatists into a puppet of theirs in the Clone Wars. This was thwarted by Anakin when he destroyed their Cortosis mines on Mokjiv. The second move was the “Now” section of Thrawn: Alliances, when they were about to start spreading into Imperial space but were again thwarted by Vader and Thrawn.  

After their failure to influence the Separatists in the Clone Wars, it is possible that they learned of Palpatine and his true intentions. Thrawn had an idea of what was going on after simply seeing a few sets of Clone armor in a Separatist base, so it is totally within the realm of possibility that the Grysk also learned of this. If they did, and Snoke is affiliated with them, that could also explain how he knew of the Emperor’s plan in such apparent detail. 

Thrawn remarks about how the Grysk are rumored to be nomadic. He eventually states that he believes it is only a rumor, but it still details an important aspect of Grysk culture. There is a reason that this rumor exists. I believe it is because they DO travel in large fleets, possibly as a smokescreen to conceal their true home to the species they invade. Supreme Leader Snoke chose to make his command center a GIANT ship that dwarfs almost anything we have seen in Star Wars to date. He travels around with a massive fleet as well, just as the Grysk are rumored to do. I think it is interesting that rather than making his capital on Starkiller Base, which appears to be the FO’s greatest investment, he diverts resources to his sprawling mobile command center. 

This brings us to the physical appearance of the Grysk. In the novel they are described as a species with deep-set eyes, angled brow ridges, wide shoulders, and a tapered skull. Now I know this doesn’t particularly sound like Snoke, but there are similarities. We also should keep in mind that Snoke is heavily deformed. He his eyes ARE deep set in his skull, and his brow ridges kind of angle into his strange melon head. His shoulders aren’t particularly wide, but he could be a genetic anomaly. His skull can be interpreted as tapered if you look at it upside down. His melon head tapers into a skinny little chin. Vader and Thrawn also only meet a small group of Grysk, so their physical description could be specific to this group. Either way, seeing as how this one line description is all we hear on their physical appearance in a 300 page novel, I think Lucasfilm asked Zahn to keep it vague for a reason. 

If Snoke is canonized as a Grysk, I’m really interested as to how they are going to implement him. Snoke has heavy ties to the main saga cast, while the Grysk are likely going to be a major antagonist in the story of Thrawn and Ezra as it continues. Maybe they are planning on tying together their animated properties and expanded universe stuff through showing the Grysk in a future film, or maybe Snoke in the Rebels sequel (maybe even both?). Me personally, I would love to see Episode 9 explain that the FO is actually a Grysk puppet state, and when Kylo killed Snoke he pissed them off by taking the order for himself. But anyway, thanks for reading this LONG theory if you stuck it out this far. I would love to hear your thoughts!

Is it really possible that the movie will be able to somehow deal with Rey's non existent story arc, or conclude kylo's (in my opinion) superb story arc in a way that doesn't just treat him as another villian. 

This is all in response to the awful script rumors that I desperately hope aren't true that leaked somewhat recently. For those that don't know the leaks basically went something like this:
Rey and Rose travel the galaxy freeing slaves to resist against the first order. The movie cumulates with Kylo fighting and losing in a battle with Rey. He fights back one last time by shooting at her, but instead hits Star killer base 2's reactor, destroying it.

The sequels make everything feel so small and contained to me but the prequels opened everything up to new material that may even be happening in the background as evidenced by stuff like the Clone Wars tv show. 

So really for me it comes down to the fact that the prequels and sequels are opposites in that the prequels weren’t great as movies but good as Star Wars movies and the sequels were pretty good movies overall but not good Star Wars movies.

Only in this universe their is no disgraced fire prince to take her on a life changing journey. Their is however a Jedi master who has been down the same road before and a handsome pilot from Thrawn's hand. 

I didn't remember much about this book going in. I remembered Jaina being called after the trickster goddess and using tricks to get the vong ships to shoot at each other but I don't remember much else. 

Jaina in this book goes well into the darkside. I mean using force lighting on a friend, wiping another friends memory, kidnapping and human experimentation....She finally comes to her senses at the end of the book but it feels like she should have been punished more. Though I guess that will come from how she treated all of her friends. 

I felt really sorry for Jag the whole book. It was a bad time to finally reconnect and try to make nice with Jaina but I liked his relationship with Jaina in this book and just knowing what will happen in the future. Also it was funny seeing Kyp try and push them together. 

Speaking of Kyp I know he was gung-ho to do what ever was needed to kill the vong but with his dislike of the darkside due to his own experiences he could have tried a little bit harder to course correct jaina in the book. 

Since it was on Hapes the book was filled with one of my favorite things, politics. No I'm not being sarcastic I liked the backstabbing and manuvering and all of that in this book. 

I would have loved more Tenel Ka in this book (since it was her home planet and all but she is spending most of it mourning Jacen and her mom so shes not up to much except the sweet ninja moves when saving her dad) but she has some good parts like the coronation. 

Everyone else was ok in the book. Nothing really amazing happend with them. The two vong we follow, a high preist and the son of the warmaster, were interesting in their parts of it. I really liked seeing the high priest and his thoughts (though what is it with a lot of fiction having the high preists/cardinals/etc not acctually believe. Its like its own trope at this point). Didn't care much for the young warrior though. He was much to hotheadded and violent which I think was why he had been sent to the priest to begin wtih. 

It seems that most of the single books between the two book sereis are more of a breather where not a lot happens and characters mostly get to rest. This one is a lot more exciting than the migrant situation on Duro. 

The next series is one I have been looking forward for a long time. The Enemy Lines sereis by Aaron Allston. I'll be honest and mention right now that their is a secret project the heroes are working on in those books to trick the vong and the first time I read it I was tricked as well. 

Anyways it was a good book. I don't know if I will read its little Epub that goes with it. I have it but I don't know if I will get around to reading it.

3216,Watched Episode 1-8 of Star Wars Recently For The First Time And I Have An Unpopular Opinion,"# Greetings.

Hi there. This is my first time using Reddit and this Sub-Reddit. I've decided to write on this Sub-Reddit because, I just wanted to share my opinions with someone. Before I start describing my journey and opinions, I just would like to clarify that my intention isn't to hurt anyone's feelings and if I did, I apologise.

# What Lead Me There?

So, I didn't really care about Star Wars until The Last Jedi (TLJ) came out back in December of 2017. This, without doubt, has to be the most divisive movie ever and me being the YouTube addict I am, I've watched TONS of videos where they either defend or destroy TLJ. Then very recently about 2 weeks ago, I went to my cousin, Harison's birthday party where he and my other cousin Sanjay were talking about TLJ for almost 20-30 mins or it at-least felt that long. That moment, I had an epiphany. I've watched so many ""Why The Last Jedi SUCKS!"" videos but not the movie or any other episode for myself to make my own opinion on the movie.

So to get to Episode 8, You obviously need to go through the first 7 episodes. I would be lying if I didn't previously say that I haven't attempted to watch Star Wars episode 1 before but, I always found it hard to get past the first 20 mins or so. (I'll get onto the later). Therefore, this time around I was serious about finishing Star Wars and making my own opinion. So I began to watch

# Prequel Trilogy.

As I have mentioned before previously, I tried watching it back in 2017 or 2016 and I was unable to get through past the first 20 minutes of episode 1 and how awful it was. So I decided this time around, to stay committed to finishing my goal. The good news is, I managed to finish the trilogy. The bad news is, I was depressed while I was watching it because of how awful it is. I don't like watching bad movies even if it's hilarious to watch so because I see it as a waste of time and having to watch the prequel I just hated it. The dialogues were awkward, the CGI was off, I didn't like the acting and as a result I found it generally boring. Don't get my wrong. There are important and good moments in all 3 movies and Episode 3 was above average which is a huge positive in comparison to the other 2 but, I just can't help feeling that only 1 film was all that was needed to tell the interesting story of rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker which could have had the same run-time as The Godfather Part II (3 hours 22 mins). If not 1 movie, 2 movies could have done the job but I'm almost certain that a genius like George Lucas could have done it with 1 movie. I've not done my research but I hope there is a fan edit of all the important scenes taken from all 3 movies to create 1 movie.

After I watched Episode 3, I felt like a huge weight was lifted from my shoulder. I thought to myself, ""Finally. Now that I have got the pretty-bad prequel trilogy out of the way, I could go watch the original trilogy. The one that started it all. The one that has a really high IMDb score and even my favourite movie critic, Chris Stuckmann gave a highly positive review for."" But, when I decided to watch it, a twist happened.

# Original Trilogy.

I was really excited to finally watch the original trilogy and as I watched episode 4 I realised something. I was starting to feel really underwhelmed by the movie and felt that the movie and the series was slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong. The original trilogy is a MASSIVE improvement over the prequels but, I just felt that the movie didn't hold up as well as people say they do. The dialogue is off, everyone acts really goofy, the film felt drawn out and long at points and most importantly for me, Darth Vader wasn't intimidating at all and if anything, Grand Moff Tarkin was more intimidating because he was the one giving out orders to Vader not vice versa. Personally, for me, I don't care how much impact the movie had in cinema history. It just doesn't hold up well in my unpopular opinion. That being said, I would be lying if I didn't admit that the movie got me interested into the whole mythology of Star Wars and what happened for example in the Clone Wars. In a way, I feel like no-one, including George Lucas didn't expect the film to do this well or else, I'm sure that he would have paid just as much attention as he did with the other 2 movies.

After feeling a bit underwhelmed by the first movie, I was sort of excited for the second movie because it was said to be one of the best movie in the trilogy and ever according to some people but I did not share the same opinion at all. Once again, I watched it and thought it was a GREAT improvement over the Episode 4. You could tell that, George Lucas and his team spent those 3 years planning not only for Episode 5 but 6 as well. Darth Vader seemed more menacing even though he was still in control and I absolutely loved every scene with Luke Skywalker in it and every scene after Luke doesn't listen to Yoda is terrific. I still think that the dialogues are a bit off and me finding 80-90% of Han Solo and Leia's presence more boring and less invested in comparison to Luke Skywalker and his character arc. The only 20-10% that I liked of Han Solo and Leia is towards the 3rd act when things are going down and everything feels like it's at brisk pace reaching for the BRILLIANT twist which re-contextualises the entire film when watching for the second time and introduces the perfect philosophical moral dilemma for Luke on what to do with his father in the next movie,

Unlike most people, I really loved episode 6. It was my favourite out of the original trilogy. There was this constant suspense of how Luke is going to deal with his father and every scene revolving him was brilliant. I would be wrong if I didn't say that the Ewok scene and the Jabba the Hunt scene felt silly and too long and Han Solo/Leia felt more interesting than in Episode 5 but not as interesting it still doesn't defeat my love for how the writers and director approached the father and son relationship and the eventual climax where Luke forgives instead show vengeance and his father saves his child then destroy him and I couldn't have asked for a better last shot myself. It was a great.

However in conclusion, I thought the original trilogy is overrated but was JUST about good.

# Sequel Dualogy (As Of Now)

After I was done with original trilogy, I found surprisingly pumped and excited to watch Episode 7 and when I finished watching it, I was finally happy watching a star wars for the first time. Of course the movie has it flaws. The humour fell flat, Rey was quite overpowered, Kylo Ren was less menacing with the mask off and overall the film was a soft remake Episode 4. But I still was happy to watch it because it was much more of an improvement over episode 4 across most departments aside from explaining the whole Star Wars Lore that episode 4 famously set up and the brisk pace of episode 7 helped a lot to keep me pumped and excited. I really couldn't catch a break as every scene was important as the other.

I finally got onto the most divisive movie ever and I loved it quite a bit. Honestly, I could see a future where kids born this minute will grow up and see the TLJ and think, ""Damn. That's a good movie."" Of course it had it's issues. I didn't like the Canto Blight scene or the purple hair lady or the whole Finn-Rose arc. When Rose kissed Finn, he looked like he wanted to go on twitter and type #MeToo. Also, I hated that purple hair lady. I was so happy and relieved when she died because I know she won't be plaguing Episode 9. But I loved this movie for how original it is in comparison to TFA which was essentially a soft reboot of Episode 4. I'm glad that the director Rian Johnson came on board and basically said, ""What the hell did you do JJ? Why did you just remake Episode 4?. Screw you. We are taking this Star Wars in new directions."" I loved Snoke's death scene because, one of the reason I'll never see Darth Vader as a great villain because at the end of the day he wasn't the master, It was the emporer. Here, Kylo Ren straight up murdered snoke and as a result I know am more invested into what Kylo Ren would do next in episode 9 now that he is his own man. I felt Kylo Ren's motivation's to be something I can 100% agree on and to a certain degree I felt like Luke Skywalker was the villain here for creating his own monster when he made his split second decision. I do feel a bit mixed about Luke just pulling out a lightsaber out of nowhere to Ben Solo instead of talking about it with Leia and Han but to some degree I guess he knew that it was inevitable. His death scene, was completely warranted for since he had to pay the price for creating his own monster.

I have to appreciate the theme of ""killing the past"" Personally for me, I didn't like most of the goofy, poorly acted, slightly poor paced past so killing it was no problem for me and I can deeply appreciate for the new and upcoming star wars fan base. The fact that there were no lightsaber on lightsaber fights really speaks for how Rian Johnson is making honest attempts to change the tiresome Star Wars formula and introduces a psychological battle which is more interesting than any fight whatsoever. I'm honesty waitng for Rian Johnson's new trilogy to see how he opens up the Star Wars universe even further.

# In Conclusion.

In conclusion, the star wars universe is over-hyped and overrated with the amount of hatred directed towards TLJ is frankly fucking moronic. It's fine to have negative opinions towards a movie, but to harass the director on Twitter is just stupid and honestly, I hope people who do that just get permanently disconnected from the internet or die before the Queen of England does. Star War movies are overall just decent action flicks or good and should be left at that. While movies like taxi driver, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Back to the future, The Breakfast Club still hold up till this very day, I just don't think that the so called original trilogy does anymore and neither does the prequel trilogy. For me, the sequel trilogy has to be the best trilogy so far even though it had it's own problems hence why I would call them decent action flicks and nothing more.

Thank you for reading all of this. I know I became rude towards the end but I just wanted to vent my frustrations towards the toxic fan base. Apart from that one bit, everything else I said was with a mature, calm tone. Feel free to share your opinions. I'm more than willing to admit anything I think I've said wrong and I think is wrong.

3234,Balance of the Force,"In Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi', many of the lines of dialogue give the impression that the Force has two sides, the light and the dark. Two sides which are in constant battle with each other, two sides that you need both of to have a balance. Below are a few quotes which back this up.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Snoke:** ""Darkness rises and light to meet it.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Rey:** ""Light. Darkness. A balance.""

&amp;nbsp;

And here's a little exchange between Luke and Rey;
&amp;nbsp; 

**Rey:** ""The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.""

**Luke Skywalker:** ""And between it all?""

**Rey:** ""Balance and energy. A force.""

&amp;nbsp; 

By this logic we can assume that no matter what out heroes do, it is for naught. Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest of the Rebellion took down the Empire and ushered in a new age of [democracy](https://i.imgflip.com/1wle02.jpg) for the galaxy. But it doesn't matter because sooner or later the Force will disrupt the order again and the galaxy will be plunged back into chaos.

&amp;nbsp; 

But that's not the worst part about the description of the Force in the film, on Wookiepedia, under the Canon section, it states Anakin brought back the balance to the Force; 

[*""Ultimately, it was Anakin Skywalker who restored balance to the Force by destroying both himself and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious""*](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chosen_One#Prophecy_fulfilled)

&amp;nbsp; 

The Dark Side of the Force is a corruption of the Force. It's taking the natural entity of moulding and manipulated in an unnatural way. It's why in the old-canon the Sith created artificial kyber crystals to go into their lightsabers, because the dark side of the Force isn't natural. And it's also why in the new-canon, the Sith/Dark-side users have to corrupt a pre-existing crystal.

&amp;nbsp; 

Now I'm not going to entirely blame RJ for this. JJ is the one that created this new universe in which we are put back into the Empire vs Rebels scenario. But in TLJ, RJ's representation of what the force is and the two sides is completely wrong, and undermines any actions any of our characters will ever face.

And watching this again after a few months passing has changed my thoughts on the film slightly. It's still very good and has a lot of great elements. Kylo Ren's arc and character in general was extremely compelling. Adam Driver killed it. The conflict inside him is the thing keeping me invested in this trilogy. Also the first scene with him and Snoke was incredible.

Rey is a much better character in this film, she actually feels like a person as opposed to in TFA, when she was just having things happen to her. I'm glad they added some conflict and depth to her. Her parents being nobodies has never bothered me, it's just the fact that it was set up to be this big thing by J.J. 

My issue with the lack of through-line between these films is too big an issue to discuss here.

Luke should not have died in this film. Honestly, his arc from cynical back to optimist was great. But I think it would've been good to get the ""classic"" hopeful Luke in Episode 9 and then kill him off. This may sound fanboyish and that's not my aim here but you really get settled with Luke once his arc is complete so you're just sort of left with the bitter Luke, which isn't a great way to end a character as iconic as him.

And finally, the pacing during the second act was pretty awful, they could've easily cut out some of the chase with the animals and the monologue from Rose, along with a few other bits and pieces.

So, we see from the wide shot moments during Kylo and Luke's conversation that there is all red ground, no snow is left.   There are no white patches that footprints can be left in.

Kylo and Luke verbally spar for a bit, and at 2:12:55, we switch to Finn and Poe, who are realizing they need to escape while Luke causes his distraction.   Off camera, Kylo and Luke presumably continue to stare at each other across the red salt. 

At 2:15:12 we return to Kylo and Luke, the wide shot shows the area is now completely COVERED in snow.  It's all white.  There is hardly any red showing.

Kylo doesn't act like a 30 year old man who has been training and learning all his life. For the most part, he seems like a whiney kid who doesn't understand why he can't have his way. His temper tantrums in TFA were sort of annoying to me and I'm glad they ditched them in TLJ, but the whining and acting like a kid still shone through in his personality. Luke and Anakin both were younger when they were on their journeys so it's a bit more realistic to me when they have their whiney moments (Tosche Station anyone?). It just seems that as a fully grown adult Kylo should act a bit more mature.

3264,The Jedi are idiots,"In Attack of the Clones, Obi-Wan tracks Jango Fett to Kamino, where he finds Jango is the template for a Clone Army secretly bred for the Republic. Jango tells Obi-Wan that he was hired by a man named Tyrannus. He then follows Jango to Geonosis where he openly associates with Dooku and the Separatists, the people the Clone Army is supposed to fight. Later, Dooku tells Obi-Wan that the Republic is under the control of a Sith Lord. 

At this point, the Jedi have enough information to know something fishy going on. However, I think it still makes sense that they might endorse the Clone Army. They were stuck between a rock and a hard place. The fact that Jango worked with both sides is odd, but he is a mercenary so it can be easily rationalized. It also makes sense that Obi-Wan would dismiss Dooku's claims as an attempt at manipulation.  

However, in the Clone Wars the Jedi Council discovers that Dooku and Tyrannus are the same person. At this point, the Jedi should have withdrawn as generals in the Grand Army of the Republic and presented their findings to the senate. I mean, the army they are using to fight the Sith led Confederacy was created by the Sith, their enemy who is sworn to destroy them. Instead they keep this to themselves because the Clones are honorable soldiers and it would undermine the war effort. But this information alone shows that the entire war effort is a sham. Their behavior doesn't make any sense. 

 But it doesn't end there. Also in the Clone Wars the Jedi discover that the Clones have a biochip that compels one Clone to murder a Jedi leader. They also discover that these chips are in all of the Clones. Now granted the Jedi never uncover the full details about the biochips, and the Kaminoans insist that they're just inhibitor chips, but given the previous information they should have been highly suspicious. But no, they decide to just sweep it under the rug. 

Even if the Jedi never discover that Palpatine is a Sith Lord, they still had all the information they needed to suspect that the Clone Army was a Sith plot to destroy them. Had they been more proactive they could have easily prevented their own demise. Simply withdrawing from the Clone Army would have negated almost all of the advantages Palpatine had over the Jedi. But no, they decided to do nothing with this information and got themselves killed. ",StarWars,1533584358,LukeChickenwalker,36,11,True,2018-08-06

3279,Rey's lineage possible theory that still allows all Ep. VII and VIII statements and actions to be true,"So this theory came to me during a discussion about various theories most of which require either some retconning or just assumptions like Kylo is lying about her parents in TLJ.

This theory allows all of what was said and the various actions of other people to be true and for Rey to still be the child of nobodies as Kylo said. 

Things that need to be true for the theory to not require something tricky with canon:
1.	Should be the child of ""nobodies"" who had her and/or left her on Jakku.
2.	Should be potentially somebody that Han would know about and potentially Leia.
3.	Should be the right age for her parents and they should be dead.
4.	Should be someone Kylo would know about as well – he knew her past – and perhaps have an innate connection to via the force.
5.	Should make sense with Rey’s vision of being left on Jakku and the ship departing.
6.	And should make some sense as to why she was left under Unkar Plutt’s care.
7.	JJ Abrams said her parents were not in TFA so that should also be true.
8.	Lucasfilm Story Group pegged her age as 19 in TFA/TLJ. And Kylo as 29 or 30.
9.	Should not be a Skywalker or Kenobi or any other relation to a force powerful family.
10.	Needs to allow for the idea that anyone can be powerful in the force that it does not depend on lineage.

Basic theory – Rey is the grandchild of Han solo and Qi’ra from the Solo movie – his first love.

Qi’ra could have had a child within 10 years after Han Solo movie which occurred 13 BBY-10BBY. So anywhere from 9 BBY to say 0 ABY. That person would be between 34 and 43 years old at the time of TFA/TLJ (in 34 ABY) if they lived. More importantly that person would be between 15 and 24 years older than Rey (who was 19 in TFA/TLJ as confirmed by Lucasfilm Story Group) which works for the age of a parent to her.

So in this theory Qi’ra and Han Solo had a child around 4BBY let’s say– which may or may not be known to Han but I speculate he does know. That’s long before meeting Leia which works for not having to make Han a cheater for example.  But for whatever reason (maybe her dark side ties and debts owed to Maul, etc.) the child is never raised by Han but by Qi’ra. The child grows up and ends up settling on Jakku and becomes a trader for whatever reason – perhaps Ki’ra would not expose the child to the dark side. Or perhaps that is where the child ended up later as an adult. As an adult this person was a junk trader and married some other lowlife Jakku trader. They then had a child in 15 ABY (Rey) but at some point, they sold her for drinking money and later died. Qi’ra finding out about her adult child’s death comes back to Jakku but will not take the child Rey with her because of her dark side ties; but instead leaves her with Unkar Plutt and pays him off to protect her but keep her from being able to escape (just poor enough). 

Now when Rey grows up and escapes she runs into Han Solo – by fate/force or just plain dumb luck. But it’s Star Wars so the universe is small despite being huge and of course they run into each other. Han hears her name ""Rey"" and assuming the version where he knows about Qi’ras kid with him and Jakku he figures out she must be his grandchild. Hence all the pseudo father-figure way he treats her and likely what he tells Maz when she asks about the girl. It sort of explains Leia’s reaction to her (sympathetic hug) if Leia knows the story too – it predated their relationship but maybe Han told her. And while she might bear a grudge for Qi'ra she likely would not for her child and Han's long lost grandchild.  And even Kylo may know of her and that’s why he knows about her parents who were nobodies (but he doesn’t mention her grandparents) or maybe he finds out after meeting her and feeling the connection. but he is being honest with her when he tells her that her parents were nobodies and buried on Jakku, etc.

This meets all the criteria:

1.	She is a child of “nobodies” who are dead and buried on Jakku and were junk traders.
2.	Han and Leia might know of her but not know her directly and be sympathetic to her life and fate.
3.	She would be the right age for a grandchild to young Han Solo and Qi’ra
4.	She could be someone Kylo knows about and has a connection to via the force as they are related.
5.	It makes sense with her being left behind on Jakku by her family (Qi’ra) and all she remembers is the ship leaving her there. Perhaps she was to young to remember her parents much. We also don’t know how much time elapsed between their deaths and the ship leaving with Qi’ra. She could have been very young when they died.
6.	It is a scenario in which leaving her with Unkar is better than taking her to the dark side.
7.	Her parents would not have been in TFA then.
8.	The ages work for Rey and Kylo and even Han.
9.	She is not a Skywalker or Kenobi but she is a Solo (not a historic “force” family)
10.	Still meets the idea that anyone can be powerful in the force.

Well, what do you think? If this has been alluded to before well... I had not heard it personally. I often heard Luke, Han (even with Qi'ra), Obi Wan or someone else like Vader or Dooku or Palpatine theories. But I've never heard this one.

3281,"Is your favorite Star Wars movie also the one you'd think is the 'objectively best one'? If not, why not?","Asking this because I've realized that, in all honesty...Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars movie. It's not the best one by far - I can't defend the awkward dialogue, sometimes iffy fight scenes, and a bunch of other things.

But when it comes down to it...well, I just have more fun watching it than the other movies in the series. I like the cheesy dialogue, and gf and I will get the same kind of slightly self-aware hype we get from watching a WWE match when Obi Wan fights Anakin. It's just super fun to me and I love it dearly. 

It's like, if someone asks me if the sequel trilogy is 'better' than the prequels I'd probably be like ""Yea."" But if they asked me which one I wanted to rewatch for fun, I'd be like 'WE'RE POD RACING LIKE IDIOTS BRO.'(I love the dumb, shitty prequels.

I think the best movie is probably one of the OT - I flip flop between all 3 of them to be honest haha. They are all really good in their own way and they all have their slight failings, but they are the best overall packages in the series I think.

Still, yeah. I actually legit enjoy Revenge of the Sith more than the rest of the series, but I'd never go as far as arguing that it's the *best.* Wondering if people feel similarly like this.

3283,My idea for Episode 9 opening scene,"I've thought about how episode 9 could start as well as how it could end, here's my idea of how it could start:

""Like what you see Luke?"" says a voice behind him

Luke turns around to see who it is, his eyes swell with tears as they jolt up and down at the figure of Obi Wan Kenobi, it had been years since he saw him or even heard his voice

""Obi Wan...wher-"" but Kenobi stops him: ""Don't be confused Luke, you are in the neatherworld of the force, this is the destination of a Jedi's spirit when they perish in the real world, it's beautiful isn't it?""

""Truly beautiful"" replies Luke. 

""You showed great courage Luke, I am more proud of you then I could ever say, what you did was a very brave act, but your time is not over yet...""

""What do you mean Ben?"" asked Luke

""Rey, she still requires training to become a Jedi, you have started her on a path that you must observe and finish, she is the galaxy's last hope""

Luke turned away and looked at the sun, it was not a normal one: it's colour changed from white to purple and to blue and a selection of other colours, he then asked:

""How do I get back to the real world?""

""I will show you"" Obi wan replies, ""just like old times, come with me, I have quite the knowledge to train you""

Obi Wan began to walk up the hill behind them, Luke followed him, no idea what to expect but ready to get back to business...

The premise for this story involved a villain called Atha Prime, who commanded a battalion of Clones from the Clone Wars. Luke and Han would battle both them and a surviving Grand Moff Tarkin and his imperial remnant.

Obviously the idea never took hold, but some of these concepts found their way into other Star Wars media later on.

3298,My simple take on the Rey's vision in the Dark-Side Cave in TLJ,"Rey asks the mirror to show her parents to her. She see's two shadowy figures that become one, and then that one figure turns into her. I think that the two shadowy figures are 'nobodies', and when they become one, it symbolizes the act of having a child (become one flesh yada yada baby making). That one shadow is still shadowy, also a 'nobody', which is revealed to be Rey - Rey is a nobody.

This conclusion is further enforced by Kylo when he tells Rey her parents were nobodies, and that she is also a nobody.

Like with Lukes Dark Side cave experience, where he sees himself as Darth Vader, the cave merely shows the force user their insecurities. Luke feared falling to the dark, and Rey feared being a person of no value. The cave doesn't tell the force user the truth, so Rey's parents may end up being Yoda and Padme or whoever.

It's a simple take but I think it is correct. I don't get the deal with the line of Rey's, sorry.. also, forgive me if this was obvious and everyone figured it out earlier, but I didn't really get it until re-watching it today and I wanted to share my interpretation.",StarWars,1530753871,jewelsteel,47,37,True,2018-07-04

They then get handed back after they meet up and Han expresses his joy at finding her again. That makes the dice seem more like a metaphorical promise or a vow. Mixing that with the Last Jedi scene, that makes the dice being handed to Leia seems a bit weird and confusing. It can't mean Han will come back since he now dead. It can't mean anything special to Leia or Luke when he placed them in her hand.

3306,Love it or hate it; Disney needs to do something about The Last Jedi's reception.,"Whether you loved the film or hated it, it seems Disney and LucasFilm are only concerned with the good things being said about their movies. On Twitter, you'll often see Rian Johnson, Mark Hamill, and other Star Wars team members liking and retweeting positive responses toward TLJ, while simultaneously giving snide remarks and insults to people complaining about it. 

I believe everyone's voices should be heard when it comes to the things they are passionate about, and treating that halfof the fanbase like they aren't as good or important as the other half doesn't seem very fair or professional. 

Yes, Star Wars fans can be childish, even cruel, and that behavior is unacceptable. However, not every fan who loved The Last Jedi should be treated as a ""real fan"", and not every fan who hated The Last Jedi should be treated as a ""whiny baby"".

With Solo's poor box office performance, Disney and LucasFilm have put a halt on further Star Wars spinoff films and have chosen to focus on Episode IX. They should realize, however, that Solo didn't perform poorly simply because it's a spinoff film. It performed poorly because it was released at the wrong time, and with the fanbase divided more than ever.

3311,My thoughts on why Luke didn't try to save Ben like he did Vader in TLJ.,"There is some debate about why Luke didn't save Ben (or Kylo Ren) like he did Vader when they 'duelled' on Krait. The argument is often: ""He managed to save a Sith Lord who killed thousands, but not a emo teen with daddy issues"". I do agree that Vader would seem harder to persuade than Ben, but it was the tactic Luke used which turned Vader to his side in ROTJ.

In ROTJ, Luke's main goal was to save Vader. He probably spent a long time thinking up different ways of doing so. In the end, he used his relationship as a son to Vader to save him. In ROTS, Palp convinced Anakin that he killed his wife and his child. With Luke's survival, Vader began to doubt the Emperor. Luke used this distrust to sow doubts in Vader's mind. He also opened his mind to Vader during their duel to show that Luke also had a sister, Leia. That was when Vader's mind snapped. His trust in the Emperor had faded and he was just about betray him, all he needed was an opportunity. Later, when the Emperor was torturing Luke with force lightning, Vader acted out. Seeing his son in pain, all he wanted to do was save him. This lead to Vader throwing the Emperor into a never ending pit, killing him. That was the moment Vader returned to the light as Anakin Skywalker, all with the aid of his son who used their relationship to return him.

This is a tactic Luke uses a lot. He sows doubt into the minds of his enemies to change their affiliation entirely. In the BF2 campaign, Luke managed to convert Del Meeko from the Empire to the New Republic. Luke sensed doubt in Del's mind, who was beginning to think whether or not the Empire was as powerful as he thought. He used that doubt and expanded it on it, saying something (can't remember what) which made Del think long and hard about his loyalties, later leading to his defection.
Why didn't Luke use this on Ben? Because he couldn't. Last time they met, Luke was just about to kill Ben in his sleep. Of course he decided not to in the end, but Ben saw Luke with his ignited saber standing over him and thought differently. His trust in his old master eroded away and he turned fully to the dark side. After that moment, Luke went into exile because of his failures.

When Ben and Luke's force projection duelled on Krait, Luke knew there was no way to save him using his old tactic of sowing doubt into his mind. Ben was full of hate. He just killed his master and he was hell bent on killing Luke. Vader on the other hand already had doubts in the Dark Side which Luke used to turn him to the light, doubts Ben didn't have.

3318,"Looking at some old threads, lots of people wanted Luke to use dark side powers and kill people in VIII. How is that truer to his character than TLJ?","“A Jedi uses the force for defense, never for attack”

I went back and looked at tons of threads about what people wanted from Luke pre TLJ. The general consensus was ass kicking and him murdering all the knights of Ren, and force choking Kylo. There’s honestly tons of threads about it, ever since MSW reported he might fight the KoR (which was false).

3332,The Last Jedi: Forceful Consequences,"This is a long, long post, so be warned. TL;DR – I try to keep the good stuff and take out the parts you don’t like.

Maybe it’s because I have a Master’s thesis to work on and job searching to do, but I’ve taken it upon myself to do what no one has asked of me – I’m going to try and fix The Last Jedi. I know there’s that remake idea going around, and I want to be clear that I’m not associated with that and wrote this before that all started. I’m calling it “The Last Jedi: Forceful Consequences” because I love Arrested Development and because it doesn’t matter what I call it because the movie is what it is. I just want to offer those interested an alternative vision.

Like so many others, I felt conflicted after watching the movie. I saw the IMAX double-feature with TFA and TLJ on opening day with my girlfriend, driving an hour and a half to do so. I’ve read most of the old EU books (I actually liked the NJO series, for instance, but I also know the EU had a lot of hot garbage), I stan Thrawn and Timothy Zahn, KotOR is my favorite SW game and one of my favorite old-Bioware RPGs (KotOR 2 + Restored Content mod is a perfect sequel). Basically, I’m a SW geek and hardcore fan. I’ve written \[bad\] fan fiction and while I’ve gotten rusty over the years due to real life, for a time I was like a walking Wookiepedia.

As soon as I watched Poe play an SNL mom-joke prank on Hux, I was concerned. I didn’t have a huge problem with the Mary Poppins thing, and I loved the development of Kylo Ren. I abhor Canto Bight so much I keep typing and erasing my diatribe against it. I’ll save that for later. My point is: While TFA was far too safe, it did *feel* like Star Wars to me, and I took it as a kind of “proof of concept” for Disney. They demonstrated they could capture the gestalt of Star Wars, after which they would go in inventive directions. Rogue One was dope, and I was surprised when I really enjoyed Solo.

The Last Jedi, as I said, has a lot of good ideas, lots of well-constructed “rhymes” and homages, and is a visually beautiful film (even if the ST lacks a sense of scale/population). I think RJ is a talented director, had a stroke of genius with Kylo’s development, made interesting and bold choices with the Force projection stuff. TLJ suffers from narrative missteps that feel like they were good enough for a first draft – which I recently discovered is exactly what happened. My impression from the panel in which this was said was that the higher-ups reacted so well to his first draft that it didn’t change much after that. It should have been improved through revision. Not unlike this post!

Finally, I want to say that I love Kelly Marie Tran but do not think Rose is a well-executed character. She’s not in my rework, but that’s because that whole sidequest is gone, so Finn doesn’t need a new character for his buddy mission.

Okay, will that out of the way, let’s do this.

\--------------------------------------------------

**The Force Awakens**: This is something of a preface. I was not impressed with the concept of Starkiller Base all the way around. I didn't like the name; it felt like a fan-fictiony homage. We didn't need Death Star 3.0, and the line in TFA about the relative size of the Death Star and Starkiller indicated some self-consciousness about the similarity on the part of Abrams. I don't like the sub-hyperspace invention for why everyone could see the explosion. I don't like that it's a cross-galaxy sniper rifle for planetary systems. It's a bad idea that only worked because it was destroyed quickly. It also got a pass because the movie functioned as a proof-of-concept that Disney could make Star Wars movie that felt like Star Wars.

A much richer idea would have been to use the Star Forge from KotOR. It also draws on the power of a star, but uses that energy to mass produce ships and weapons and so on. Using the Star Forge would allow for the same plot, but also answer the question of how the First Order was able to produce such a war machine under the nose of the New Republic. It offers Snoke a background story, too (but dear God, whoever thought Snoke was a good name… they should be sent to the gulag along with whoever named that character in *Bloodline* “Ransolm Casterfo”). If he was delving into ancient Force-user secrets, then he could have found reference to the Star Forge, then found it (since we’re just appropriating the EU) and used it to build the First Order. Even the name, First Order, makes little sense to me as-is (can anyone enlighten me on the name?). But if it was predicated on an ancient empire -- one of the first galactic empires, called the Infinite Empire in the game -- then the name functions as a callback. Lastly, a friend of mine suggested that this idea makes Kylo’s mask’ aesthetic homage to Revan more meaningful.

\--------------------------------------

**The Last Jedi**: I share many of the critiques and criticism that others have. Without rehashing them all, and having thought about it for months now, I believe TLJ has two classes of problems.

***One***, it is simply too meta. Star Wars has always been funny, but TLJ is extremely self-conscious, rather than merely demonstrating reflexivity on the part of the creators. It is impossible for me to imagine Hux alongside Imperial officers, or Han Solo brushing his shoulders off or making a mom joke as he tries to get to Endor. Can you imagine the ""rebel scum"" line in the OT? Luke tossing the lightsaber is another example. It isn't that it's unbelievable that he would be dismissive, or even that he would toss it aside. It's jarring because his tossing was a direct, meta response by Rian Johnson and Co. to the cliffhanger at the end of TFA. It works in films, sure, but not in the mythic space opera that Star Wars is. The “subverting expectations” is undeniably overt and in-your-face; that’s why it’s used derisively by TLJ critics and defensively by it’s admirers. I saw a comment around Reddit asking if myths like Star Wars ought to deconstruct themselves. It’s an interesting question, but whatever the answer I maintain the execution and tone being meta was a fundamental mistake.

***Two***, there are narrative decisions that should not have gotten through the first couple drafts. The slow-chase, the animal-rights-but-not-slave-rights hamfist, Holdo's existence. I'm conflicted on Rose because I want to like her character, and I understand her everywoman appeal, but I think her implementation -- like other decent ideas -- was lacking.

I should say that I found Kylo Ren's development in TLJ to be superb. It's so effective that I went from feeling ambivalent to finding him the most appealing Star Wars character in recent memory (including other media, not just film). I can't help but dream of how damn good Adam Driver would have been as Anakin. So his development, and his connection with Rey, are both aspects of the film I like a great deal, and they essentially carry the sequel trilogy. I also liked a lot of ""rhymes"" that RJ put in; Luke saving Leia with a projection vs her asking for help via hologram in ANH; Luke standing over Kylo vs standing over Vader; the tree on Ach-To burning looking like the Jedi symbol; Rey and Kylo’s mirror styles and movements -- all that is beautiful and subtle and deserves due credit.

With that in mind, the only way to tackle a ""fix"" of The Last Jedi is to preserve as much of the structure as possible, but nothing that simply needs to go. This is a fine line to walk and balance, but I think I've managed to do so pretty well. I have kept most characters, general plot points, and overall arc. Rose and Holdo are gone, but Phasma and DJ have larger roles.

\----------------------------------------------------

**The Last Jedi: Forceful Consequences**

NOTE: This is constructed by issue, but is not exhaustive and only roughly chronological.

**1. THE CHASE.** Instead of active hyperspace tracking and the consequential slow-burn chase, we have something closer to the Cylon attacks from the Battlestar Galactica reboot. The Resistance gets to another of their planetary safehouses -- only to have the First Order show up. Each time, the Resistance loses a little more of their own, and it's clear they can't keep this up; they're running out of places to run to. This anticipates the plea for help to their allies in the RJ version, and puts them in a similar situation, but avoids all the hairiness of the slow-chase. It also offers us a lot more time to play with, rather than the few hours the RJ film takes place in. It should be said that I also intend for this change to give Hux more front-and-center screentime and set him up as a shrewd and sadistic rival to Kylo, rather than the caricature he is now.

**2. LEIA AND THE FORCE.** Leia doesn't demonstrate Force powers via surviving a blast into space, but through something akin to Battle Meditation. Battle Meditation is used in various EU media and originated in one of Zahn’s books. In this sense, it’s where a Force-Sensitive person uses their ability to help synchronize their forces in battle. It's subtle, fits Leia’s personality and position, and makes her all that more important to holding the Resistance together as it flees repeated assaults by the FO. She soon realizes that the FO is either tracking them or knows about their various bases. How they know is not too important. It can't be a removable tracker, but could be some mind-probing of Snoke's, old-fashioned intel -- or treachery by DJ, which we'll get to presently.

**3. THE PLAN.** Knowing the above, Leia decides she has to reach out to an old Rebel ally, as she reveals several high-ranking Rebels once split the locations for rebel safehouses amongst themselves in case others were compromised. She explains that this ally, DJ, knows of a safehouse/base that the FO 100&amp;#37; cannot know about. The problem is that she doesn't know how to contact DJ these days, only his general location. Finn is eager to escape because Rey's gone and he doesn't think they'll survive, and Poe knows the region, so they are the ones sent. Poe, it should be noted, has until this point acted like he does in the RJ version -- eager to fight and hating running away. But they've had several skirmishes and keep losing, so his prowess as a pilot is of diminishing relevance, as they simply cannot afford direct engagements, and he wants/needs to feel useful.

**4. LUKE’S PURPOSE.** On Ach-To, Luke doesn't simply toss the saber aside immediately. Whether or not he tosses it aside after a few moments is another story. But it can't be so overtly meta because it messes with immersion and believability, and makes it feel too constructed. Again, Star Wars is mythic and those choices cheapen that. His reason for being there is a bit different. Like in RJ's version, he had a crisis of faith following Ben's corruption and fall, but it’s more general rather than harkening back to one fateful moment as in RJ's version. He isn't dead-set but ambivalent about ending the Jedi, and has sought out the first temple for wisdom, to see where the Jedi lost their way, why the Light and Dark struggle continues -- these kinds of existential questions. He's depressed, disillusioned, and sure, let's say he's cut himself off from the Force such that he doesn't know about Han, or other developments.

**5. SKYWALKER LEGACY.** Luke feels something he hasn’t felt in a long time upon hearing of Han’s death – rage. At least at that level - not since his fight with Vader. He views Kylo as his failing, and takes responsibility for Han’s death. This is complicated because Luke feels guilt both for failing Kyle in the first place and now for *not* acting, thereby allowing his friend’s death to play out. In his emotion, he opens himself up to the Force and connects with Leia. Her first reaction is fear at the immanence of his anger and he retreats, shutting himself off again.

Perhaps because of Luke’s rage or awakening, Rey (who has been in several Ach-To scenes so far) feels the dark side cave calling her and is headed there when Luke notices she’s gone. She gets there before him, and when Luke enters, he doesn’t see her. But as he starts to head inside, he’s greeted by an old friend – Yoda. Yoda being in the Dark Side cave both subverts the idea that the two sides of the Force are simply discrete, and it also rhymes with his cave encounter on Dagobah in ESB. This is where Yoda gives Luke the training pep talk; the difference with RJ’s version is that in mine, Luke actually trains her after the cameo whose existence is ostensibly to give him the confidence to do so.

Luke moves through the DS cave and emerges in front of the Tree, within which is Rey. This is where Luke actually asks “Who are you?” and so on. Luke gives her the spiel about the Jedi and their dogma/arrogance, but agrees to train her to be the first of a New Jedi Order (again). This is as opposed to the way he approached teaching Ben and the other students.

**6. LUKE AND BEN’S HISTORY.** When Rey asks Luke about Ben/Kylo, Luke tells her the general outline – that Snoke had managed to corrupt Ben with visions of his grandfather and legacy, but that by the time Luke realized it, it was too late to prevent the massacre.

The story about Kylo's corruption is different. I'm trimming the *Rashomon*\-style device because I don't think it worked. I don't think that igniting your lightsaber over your sleeping nephew counts as a ""fleeting"" moment. It would be better to have a series of flashbacks where Ben’s acting out, gradually more violently, until he does his frenzy-tantrum thing on another student such that Luke has to intervene. In *that* moment, we have Luke standing over Ben and the callback to standing over Vader. It’s in that moment of déjà vu that Luke sees the man that Snoke has led Ben to see: Kylo Ren, Heir to Vader.

Kylo, of course, doesn’t seem himself as being corrupted, or as evil, but predestined and sees Luke’s déjà vu as aggression, insecurity, and hypocrisy. And, Ben is afraid, but being Ben he is himself insecure and in these few moments, as Luke flashes back to RotJ, Kylo does the opposite of Vader in that scene and rather than surrender, he attacks. Luke is unsuspecting or unwilling to engage and ends up taken out of the fight long enough for the massacre to happen. Or, if you really don’t like Luke losing to teen-Ben or playing Gandhi, maybe Ben defers but takes some other students and burns the training grounds that night.

**7. LS TRAINING.** Then we have our equivalent of the training/Reylo section of the film, broken up as days/nights. The days consist of Luke’s lessons to Rey, less on the goofy side, and more like the scene where Rey encounters the Force via Aronofsky-esque cuts. The nights introduce and involve the Rey and Kylo connection, leading her to ask Luke more about Ben, for her and Ben to bond, and for her to believe he can turn.

**8. DS TRAINING.** Meanwhile, Snoke is actually following through on his TFA plan to complete Kylo’s training. We see less of this than Rey and Luke, but we do see Snoke teaching Kylo how to use his emotion rather than be controlled by it, as well as martial/mental things. I don’t have specifics in mind, but only that it needs to show the Dark Side on its own terms (maybe Kreia-esque, for you KoTOR II fans). These complement the Rey/Luke scenes in that his training takes place in dark areas, and when he sees Rey he’s in brighter rooms/areas.

**9. POE AND FINN BUDDY QUEST.** Across the Galaxy, Poe and Finn are on SOME PLANET finding DJ. It could be Canto Bight, but with an aesthetic far from the Harry-Potter-meets-Hunger-Games look of the film. The planet itself probably doesn’t matter so there’s a lot of latitude here. Simply, Poe and Finn need to have their equivalent of Rose and Finn in RJ’s movie. I would stay away from ham-fisting environmental/animal/moral lessons into the narrative, but it could certainly be a situation that highlights the fact that some sell to both sides. Eventually, they find DJ, who identifies himself as the successor to Leia’s contact (could be familial or not), who is dead or something – this section needs revision/attention -- and confirms he has the info they need. In a holocall with Leia, Poe, and DJ, Finn agrees to go to Crait with DJ to make sure the base is ready to receive the Resistance. Finn, as with his eagerness to take the initial assignment, is still running. Poe, who has the opposite problem, refuses to do anything but return to the fleet.

Poe goes one way, and Finn+DJ go another. As/after they land on Crait, Finn overhears DJ reporting something to someone he recognizes as Hux. The FO traitor confronts the Rebel traitor and they have a brief scuffle that DJ wins via dirty fighting. But as soon as he gets a change, Finn runs away and flees aboard the shuttle, desperate to warn the fleet. Once he’s out of jamming range, he jumps to hyperspace.

**10. FINN’S ARC.** Finn, en route to the fleet, learns that DJ disabled the comm system. Faced with the opportunity to drop out of hyperspace before reaching what is likely the start of the end of the Resistance, Finn bravely continues on and finds the Resistance under attack by Hux, caught by an Interdictor cruiser, and trying to break LOS around the planet and its moon with their sublight drives. It’s only a matter of time before Hux microjumps ahead, receives reinforcements, or they run low on fuel.

Finn reaches the R*addus* right as the battle does, and lands just before Phasma’s boarding party. He gets to the bridge and sends Leia, 3PO, and company to the shuttle, though Ackbar refuses to leave. Finn rallies a handful of un/familiar Resistors as Phasma storms the bridge. He has his boss fight with Phasma and emerges far from unscathed but in triumph. It is, of course, less meta, and less like a fatality in Mortal Kombat. This brave stand affords Ackbar the time to angle at the Interdictor cruiser and ram it, crippling the Interdictor’s shields and field generators, which can pull ships out of hyperspace or prevent them from jumping. This destroys the Raddus, killing Finn and Ackbar who sacrificed themselves for the Resistance (including Poe, who’s been flying around heroically during the battle). The Resistance survivors make the jump to hyperspace, headed to Crait. This is an adaptation of what I *thought* was about to happen in TLJ before Rose saved what she loved so he wouldn’t destroy what they hated (the point has been made that this is exactly what Luke did by sparing Vader, and I can vibe with the sentiment, except that Luke didn’t say it aloud to himself before tossing aside his saber… though comparing Vader to a battering ram cannon is interesting, I guess). Finn’s arc has been completed and his death acts as climax of the FO-Resistance story arc, allowing the threads to converge on Crait.

The Resistance, at this point, is essentially in the same position as in the film. The FO knows they’re going to Crait, and so their only hope is to hold out and call for help. The difference is that their fleet is a little more substantial, so there can be a scene of the FO wrecking their ships after the Resistance has to abandon them for the base.

***Note:*** *The Holdo Maneuver. The novelization’s enumeration aside, the Holdo Maneuver has the Raddus effectively turn into a bullet, or as one Redditor said, into a “big fucking blaster bolt”, before punching a hole clean through the Supremacy, and several Destroyers in its wake. There are threads innumerable, on Reddit and elsewhere, debating whether or not, or to what extent, it’s a one trick pony -- or violation of the universe’s internal logic. A lot of these revolve around scalability, cost, and the physics around the acceleration and impact. But most of these questions about the Maneuver are moot until we resolve an apparent contradiction in the canon.*

*In TLJ, it appears that Holdo collided with Snoke’s ship after initiating the jump to hyperspace but before entering hyperspace. In the canon Timothy Zahn novel,* *Thrawn*\*, reference is made to “pseudomotion”. This term is a carry-over from Zahn’s books in the EU and is described on Wookiepedia (if that counts as a source) as “seeming acceleration”. As I understand, ships in Star Wars do not\* ***accelerate*** to lightspeed, but use magiscience\*\*hypermatter particles to make a jump to hyperspace. Somehow these particles and their pseudomotion get around the in-and-out-of-universe impossibility/infeasibility of having to accelerate relativistically to lightspeed in order to enter hyperspace by simply jumping (in)to it, illustrated by pseudomotion from outside and starlines from inside. All this is to say that what happens in TLJ has to be a result of the interaction between the pseudomotion and/or its path and the Supremacy**\*.\~\~**\~\~\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*I tend to side with those that see no in-universe obstacle to groups like the First Order mass-producing what are essentially droid/smart missiles with hyperdrives, or using the maneuver in other last stands, especially by groups like Sith or Mandalorians. But of that is speculation until there’s more information about pseudomotion – that is, what actually* ***happened***\*. I think it’s inherently hairy, and the fact that the topic is so well-tread is testament to it’s transformity. I think the shot+silence is beautiful, and if I find myself convinced that the whole thing isn’t not universe-breaking after all, that’s great.\*

*In that case, I would want to “nerf” the Maneuver by adding a risk, or a cost. Namely, the possibility of collateral damage. With the instabiltiy of the fuel in Solo in mind, maybe if the hyperdrive is destroyed mid-jump, events unfold like in TLJ, but randomly – several directions, differing amounts of force and distance. Because the matter was in a liminal postion between realspace and hyperspace, some of it enters hyperspace before reentering realspace. When this happens, it can be anywhere within a reasonable distance; in the middle of the nearby moon, off the coast of the third planet’s largest city, the medical frigate – recall in this version the Resistance isn’t down to transports but has some cruisers, etc. Something like that could make it work.*

*For now, there’s too much uncertainty and I’m playing it safe.*

**11. REY MEETS SNOKE.** Around the time Poe and Finn are meeting DJ, Luke walks in on one of Rey and Kylo’s forays in sexual tension and does his thunderclap thing to end it. It is now that Rey confronts Luke with Ben’s side of the story – Luke standing over him threateningly after sparring -- and runs off despite his pleas to wait and his insistence that her visions won’t play out the way she thinks. This, like in the film, is a direct rhyme of ESB.

Not unlike the film, Rey, Kylo and Snoke come together, only not on *Supremacy*, but at Snoke’s sanctum, which could be explicitly named or shown to be a place like Malachor, or somewhere unspecified beyond clearly being Snoke’s bachelor pad. How that’s handled depends on IX (though I guess all this does).

The throne scene plays out essentially as it does in the film, and continues to rhyme with RotJ by having Snoke brag about the FO’s plan to wipe out the Resistance on Crait – the endgame, he calls it – ala Sheev. Then Kylo makes his move, the big fight happens, as does the struggle over the lightsaber (though that saber should have stayed on Bespin). I want to say that whole Reylo throne scene was one of my favorite moments and I got goosebumps in the theater. We see Rey get up first, take Hux’s place in considering killing Kylo, and then rush to Crait. Kylo awakens soon after and also leaves, headed for Hux’s flagship.

**12. ALL ROADS LEAD TO CRAIT.** The retreat to Crait works much like in the film. Kylo takes command of the FO, forcing Hux into submission in homage to Vader’s classic Force Choke. Rey shows up as the FO is assaulting the base and, like in the film, we see a showdown between Luke and Kylo. Spoiler alert: Luke doesn’t brush his shoulder off. Because Luke’s stranded on Ach-To, he does more or less the same Force Projection as in RJ’s version. But unlike in his, in ours Luke doesn’t die. He talks to Leia, interacts with C3PO, and goes out to face down Kylo and the FO. The duel between him and Kylo is a little more eventful but retains its Old Man Ben v Vader vibe. When Luke is revealed to be projecting himself, the film plays out much like it did in the film. While the FO and Hux are stalled by the spectacle and Kylo’s orders, the Resistance escapes mostly onboard the *Falcon* and a couple other small shuttles and transports. Rey and Poe meet and the film ends with that shot in the *Falcon*.",StarWars,1530801204,Wildernaess,0,1,True,2018-07-05
3333,Bombing in space,"Hello there,

I know that not everyone likes episode 8, but want to deeper understand of possibility bombing in space.

In the film, all ships have artificial gravity, so all the bombs in a hanging state have potential energy and when they are detaching from the guides, they fall under their weight down. That why, after going into space according to the law of conservation of energy, their speed does not disappear

3335,The strengths and weaknesses of the films,"For a school project, I need to talk about how Star Wars films have changed since 1977. I'd like to talk about a few points for each film (both production and the films themselves) as well as each trilogy overall.

So far, I have that the OT was focussed mainly on storytelling and practical effects; the PT was world building and CGI; the ST seems to be more focussed on visuals and a balance of CGI and practical effects at the expense of original stories; and the anthology films are a mix of ST and OT style.

Any ideas/suggestions would be a great help while I brainstorm before putting it all together but please don't just give your opinions without a justification as I'd like this to be non-biased. Thanks!",StarWars,1530805287,NedHasWares,5,1,True,2018-07-05
3336,Journey to Last Jedi,"I have been a fan of the STAR WARS saga for about a decade, since I was kid a 7yo kid. When I learnt in 2014 Disney had purchased the franchise to make new films, I was confused since I didn't know why Lucas sold it. The hype for Force Awakens was immense and I enjoyed the film despite Han's death which shattered me. The majority of the fans loved or at least liked the film and the critics received it with relative praise. So everything was good so far with Rebels as well filling the gaps between the films.

Next came the first anthology film. I wasn't particularly interested in that film, so I didn't watch it in the cinema. The fanbase though was relatively satisfied with the film despite its flaws which concerned especially the characters. So, by the end of 2016, Disney/LucasFilm had released two films that succeeded both as SW films for most fans and financially from the company. Of course, some of the core &amp; casual fans didn't like the films or one of them and weren't satisfied, but you cannot make everyone happy. I personally watched Rogue One when it was released on Blu Ray, and although I didn't love it the first time as much as it TFA, I gradually liked more and more, especially Vader and the space and ground battle.

I rejoined again the SW fanbase (I was reading GOT &amp; LOTR in 2016) when the 2017 celebration took place. Then, the first trailer of TLJ came out and fans were hyped about the next instalment. Simultaneously, Rebels was getting better and better, appealing to even more fans since Thrawn &amp; Maul were added to the mix. 

However, with the release of TLJ, although it was initially met by praise by the critics, many fans absolutely hated the film, resulting in (probably) the first big division in the core fanbase. I personally didn't like the film on first watch, but now I have come to like it more. We all know the rest, there is no point in tiring you. Long story short, I loved Solo and the final episodes of Rebels.

My question is why did The Last Jedi cause such a massive split whereas all of the 8 preceding films couldn't do that? Sure, it was quite bold in several of its decisions. But what made it so different in order for so many fans to hate it?",StarWars,1530806359,panmpap,73,0,True,2018-07-05

I'm fine with Johnson, he's a great director and if anything, you can say he's imaginative and has guts. I wonder if the importance he placed on the ancient texts and legacy of the Jedi in TLJ is a wink to where he might be going with a new trilogy. He seemed to enjoy this theme, so I could see him jumping back to the beginning of the Jedi order.

Benioff and Weiss do feudal fantasy so well, I'd love to see them pull something from Tales of the Jedi or KotOR, like the fall of Exar Kun. That might be too cliche or just wishful thinking.",StarWars,1530808528,killedbydinosaurs,3,2,True,2018-07-05

3340,All the Star Wars movies are good. Including Last Jedi," I get it, the fandom is upset with TLJ. Personally, I liked it. I even liked Rose and her storyline, the least popular part according to the fan reviews. But objectively, MOST PEOPLE like all of the Star Wars movies, some more than others, sure, but they all receive generally positive reviews by the general public. 

At one point, the fans ***HATED***  the prequels. Now they love them because it's the (un)popular thing to do. Let us not forget r/prequelmemes started out as an ironic subreddit designed to mock the prequels, and now the prequels are wholly appreciated by the fans as a whole. 

It might be treason, then, but LTJ and the sequels (and the anthology, yes even Solo) are genuinely good movies according to the movie-going population as a whole. And I support that notion.

After the crawl, and standard pan down and reveal the planet Corusaunt, with a First Order Star Destroyer coming in overhead, with nice camerawork to reveal it’s not just a single Star Destroyer, its an entire fleet. 

Then it goes into a montage of what seems to be the First Order seizing military control of the Galaxy. 

Similar instances of Star Destroyers coming out of Hyperspace and First Order landing craft arriving on other planets we’ve come to know over the years. 

Naboo, Utapau, Yavin IV, Endor, Jakku, Takodona, Canto Bight

As crowds of Stormtrooper rush off of the drop ships you expect that it is a hostile invasion of these planet but instead of the people running and screaming in terror.... the troopers are greeted with cheers and applause. 

It is revealed that it have been exactly 3 years since the Battle of Crait, and surprisingly, the new Supreme Leader Kylo Ren has actually been doing a very good job running the galaxy. Crime appears to be down, the citizens actually seem to be alright with the new rule. 

Through some parade exposition about the history of the First Order (aka how we got here to catch the audience up). After Crait the Resistance went into hiding, and Kylo, being the son of a senator, used those skills to negotiate and actually form an alliance with the then recently dismantled New Republic. Taking advantage and putting himself into power (ala Palpatine in the Prequels) 

But this time he’s not actually trying to deceive anyone. He rallies the galaxy behind his entire “Let the past die” mentality. Vowing that the First Order will not be as militaristic and fear based as the Empire, but won’t be as weak and democratic as the New Republic. 

While the expositional dialogue continues, another montage of planets begins... we see more elite Stormtroopers accompanied by officers and a single member of the Knights of Ren, visiting specific locations from the past... the Royal Palace Throne Room in Naboo with the painting of Padme.. the troopers taking it down.. cut to Tatooine, the Lars Homestead troopers gathering around working., a couple troopers standing on the “binary sunset hill” as the sun sets as the commander tells the troops to fall out, as we get one wide look at the homestead when suddenly it explodes... the explosion completely erasing it from existence.. Finally cutting to Jakku.. the Judland Wastes..

There's an even hint to this in the dialogue where Luke says ""I'll always be with you, just like your father.""

3358,[spoilers] Are we to assume the New Republic in the sequel trilogy is a direct copy of the Old Republic?,"One of the major complaints I and many others have had with the sequel trilogy to date is a complete lack of explanation as to the political state of the galaxy in the post Return of the Jedi era. I have often wondered why the First Order is fighting against the Resistance instead of against some official military power of the New Republic. This has been an area of the ST that has bothered me immensely, however I recently re-watched Episodes I and II and a major plot point of those movies is that the Republic has no military force except for the Jedi Council (which they explicitly say is not an army). Padme has multiple scenes in which she implores the senate to use diplomacy instead of military action to achieve peace. Her pleas are ultimately ignored and Palpatine’s manipulation of the whole thing causes the Clone Wars to happen.

But the point is, are we supposed to assume that after the Empire was defeated, a New Republic was formed which decided to revert immediately to its pre-Empire, absolutely no military state? Would no one realize the delicate situation the entire Galaxy would be in and that there would be billions of potential empire sympathizers out there?

3368,Why I disagree with the notion that r/prequelmemes made the prequels more popular,"I love the prequels, and I know a lot of other people here love them too. It's clear that the prequels are generally more liked now than they used to be. I've seen a lot of people say that this is because of the popularity of r/prequelmemes, but I don't think that's true at all. I think the memes are a result of people liking the prequels more, not the cause. I'm sure a lot of people have re-watched the prequels because of the memes and have ended up enjoying them, but I think those people would have still enjoyed re-watching the prequels even if the memes didn't exist.

I think the reason the prequels are more popular is because the sequels have given us a different perspective on them. Personally, the first time I re-watched the prequels was the weekend after TFA came out. My friend and I saw it together, and we liked it, but we were annoyed with how much fanservice there was and how it was so similar to ANH. So that weekend we were like, hey, let's watch the prequels and see how they compare to TFA. (This was before I was aware of prequel memes. I had never seen somebody ironically talk about loving the prequels before.)

My first thought when I started watching The Phantom Menace was how the look and tone of the movie were WAY different than TFA. It's crazy to think that the two movies are even part of the same series. Everything about it (visuals, plot, acting, etc) was completely different from TFA. My friend and I ended up totally digging it. Yes we laughed at the bad dialogue and made fun of it, but there was still lots of stuff in the movie we thought was cool. We were very entertained.

I think TFA is what caused people to view the prequels in a different light, not the memes. In the past, the general consensus was that the OT was ""real"" Star Wars, and the prequels were a failed attempt at replicating it. But now people view it a bit differently. The goal of TFA was to imitate the OT in a modern filmmaking style, and the film definitely succeeded at that. But it turns out that that's not necessarily as interesting as people thought it would be. So now instead of viewing the prequels as ""bad"" Star Wars, it's now easier to view them as simply a different flavor of Star Wars. 

And every flavor of Star Wars has a different appeal. If you want to watch something slick and polished, with tried-and-true plot and characters, then TFA is the way to go. But if you want something weird, crazy and kind of dumb, then that's what the prequels are for. There's room for both.",StarWars,1530824335,WildlifeAnalysis,10,0,True,2018-07-05

3371,The Last Jedi- alternative idea (spoilers),"Ok so after watching The Last Jedi multiple times and talking with my brothers who have dissected every scene. I have a thought on a small change in the story that would have made Luke's arc more convincing. 

So in the movie it's established that Luke ""thought about killing Ben"" because he saw the darkside in him. Which IMO doesn't sound like something Like would do. Also, I think this is a big issue people have with the movie, they feel like  it wasn't a Luke move. 

I think what would have been more convincing would have been Luke seeing the darkside and actually telling Ben to embrace it and bring ""balance to the force"". Luke would hope that this would stop Ben from going completely dark like his father. While this happens Ben snaps because no Jedi had been able to balance it and he sees he can be more powerful with the darkside. Luke feels ashamed of the fact he pushed Ben down that road and more importantly Leia and Han are pissed and push Luke away. 

So in this case Luke is in hiding because he actually did something that caused the down fall of his family and he doesn't want to use the force because he has seen it destroy everyone he loves. 

This to me sounds more reasonable and more convincing.

3372,Fighting Fate - How the Fall of Luke Skywalker Echoes the Fall of Anakin Skywalker,"One thing about TLJ that I haven’t seen discussed much is the way that Luke’s temptation to murder Ben Solo echoes the downfall of his own father, Anakin Skywalker. In fiction and myth there is a long history of men who hear prophecies and, in the attempts to disrupt the prophecy, inadvertently bring the prophecy to fruition. All the way from Oedipus Rex, whose parents sent him away in order to foil a soothsayer’s prediction, right up to Lord Voldemort who tried to kill Harry as a child to disrupt Trelawney’s prophecy, you can find examples of this trope. Star Wars is no exception. 

When Padme becomes pregnant with Anakin‘s child, Anakin begins to suffer from nightmares in which Padme dies in childbirth. He becomes hellbent on finding a way to stop Padme from meeting the same fate as his mother. This desire to do good becomes his rationale for committing evil and, in the end, he is responsible for Padme’s death. (*Ironic*)

Similarly, as Luke stands over Ben he experiences a premonition. He sees Ben as a mass-murdering monster who must be stopped if the galaxy is to remain safe. In his desire to prevent atrocities, he momentarily considers killing his own nephew. But, as we see, this attempt to thwart his vision causes Ben to become the monster he sought to avoid. If Luke had stayed his hand, would Kylo Ren have ever come to be?

When people talk about making the stories feel “connected,” this is the kind of thing I’m interested in: watching the same themes reinterpreted and reimagined to new and interesting ends. I don’t really care about seeing Finn grab Luke’s training drone in TFA, or seeing squash-nose and buttface show up in Rogue One, but I really dig it when filmmakers find interesting ways to draw parallels without becoming redundant.

3382,a TLJ controversy I don't understand,"A lot of people cite ""Luke tried to kill Ben and that's not in his character"" as a reason for disliking TLJ. And that point is defended (rightfully) by people saying it is actually in character.

The whole murder decision and scene was pretty poorly done - we didn't even get to see Luke's vision so that we could understand how he reached that decision, and basing it off a vision in the first place is pretty flimsy. After all, Yoda didn't try to kill Anakin in II when he sensed his darkness. And for that matter, he didn't even see any specifics.

But even that's beside the point. I think people are conflating two issues - Luke trying to kill Ben, and **Luke abandoning his friends, the Republic, and letting his students fall into Snoke's hands to be depressed on an island for nearly a decade.** Now THAT'S what's out-of-character for Luke, and I think that's what actually bothers a lot of people, and they just oversimplify it by making their argument about the actual attempted murder itself.

Luke is prone to darkness but he never gives up. He didn't give up when he discovered Vader was his father, fully realizing the fear of the darkness within him, and he *shouldnt* have given up because of a moment of weakness in the future either.

I really believe TLJ would have much less backlash if, instead of just being depressed on an island, Luke was trying in some way to bring his students back to the light - whether that be searching through history to learn about Anakin's fall, or any other fallen jedi, or even trying to track down the students and talk to them.

3391,Why the critics loved the The last Jedi...and the fans hated it...,"It’s been 6 months since the last Jedi.  So much analysis, YouTube videos, and articles have been written all over social media.  It’s divided the fan base some claim. Here’s my take in a few words. 

I saw trailers for the last Jedi expecting to see Luke fight again with a lightsaber for the first time since rotj.  I never read the EU but it seemed safe to assume he would become a wise Jedi grand master. 

But Rian Johnson correctly understood that for there to be any passing of the torch from one generation to the next there had to be some flaw that Jedi could not overcome.  If you go back to the original trilogy the Jedi failed to stop the rise of the Sith Lord Vader and emperor Palestine.  That’s why obI wan and yoda went into hiding. And that’s why they neEded  Luke to become a Jedi.  Now with the rebels he took down the empire. But the age old Jedi versus Sith battle wasn’t fully dealt with. 

In comes Ben Kylo Ren solo.  Luke has a midlife crisis realizing that it’s all happening again. Should he murder Kylo before he becomes even worse than Vader or should he fight his nephew and snoke and cause even further bloodshed? He chooses the Buddhist Pacifist way.  He wants to Get out of the endless  cycle and meditate on it all.  He chooses to “opt out”.  

In comes rey. She shows him there is still light in the world. And it should be fought for. And finally Luke re-emerges one last time to correct and make up for his earlier mistake. Finally in the end he comes to realize that the fight between good and evil is eternal. The force he realizes will remain eternal and he must play his part in it.  

Perhaps Johnson thought of Luke as being overconfident. Has he really faced a loss as big as accidentally turning Kylo to the dark side ? It must have ruined his confidence and his core beliefs about the entire balance of the universe. 

Now is this a perfect way to send off Luke Skywalker? Could we have had at least a few battles with him against Kylo and snoke ? Maybe , maybe not.  What I do believe is correct is that a new interpretation of what the force (light and dark sides) was needed desperately to keep the franchise moving forward.  I for one loved it after repeated viewings. Because I finally understood what rian was trying to say. The beauty of the force is that it’s not genetic and it’s not held by only a special few Sith or Jedi. It’s in ALL LIVING THINGS as yoda once said. 

When I try to understand the last Jedi in this regard I love it. It’s about balance and the end of dogma. It is genius.

I want to start with the best of the best, so can you recommend me your favorite (or some of the most well-liked) ones?

To give you an idea of what I personally like in a Star Wars story (I would really appreciate it if you could keep this in mind when giving your recommendation):

\- **The force, jedi vs. sith, lightsaber fights, powerful characters, touching stories (deaths etc.), great lore**! If I should compare this to the movies I would say all 6 first episodes satisfy these points.  


What I'm a bit less interested in (what I probably don't want the main storyline in the book to be about):

\- **Politics, space battles, non-force wielding characters (ordinary people)**. I would say Rogue One is the movie that best satisfies these points, and even though I think it was a great movie I would prefer a book with a strong focus on the Force and siths.

But there’s one thing I don’t want to see, I don’t want Revan coming back into canon using a cross guard saber. I don’t know how the plan on handling the Old Republic in the future. But the Jedi and Sith will be the main thing to watch when it comes to that and I’m sure crossguard lightsabers will appear. 

Personally I think they need to make the crossguard sabers even older than Revan. Cause when they bring all the Old Republic stuff back Revan should not have a red and purple crossguard saber. If they bring back Darth Malgus and Satele Shan they should have the same lightsabers they used in legends. Make the crossguard saber an extremely early design before all the well known stuff from legends get reintroduced to the new canon

3446,First time viewing TLJ,"I am in love with the OT, didn't like the PT and didn't care much for TFA. So I wouldn't consider myself a ""hardcore"" fan. But I loved the OT as just great fantasy films with lovable characters etc etc. Just a little background.

I don't want to regurgitate what everyone else has already said on both sides of the fence about TLJ. But I finally watched (for free online) after all the internet noise by myself and give my 2 cents. I'll try and keep it brief. 

Luke Skywalker: Wtf? His character became a bubbling, bitter loser?  There were points I seriously felt this was a parody of the character like Space Balls. It was as if the director never saw a SW film before.  Luke to me literally felt like a villain in this film.  

Leia:  I loved the princess in the OT. Such a great lovable lead character. I can't place my finger on it, but I did not like her at all in this movie. I don't know if it was her condescension of Poe (who was completely marginalized as a character in the movie), but I couldn't believe how unlikable she was to me. I really feel bad saying that after Cary passed (RIP). 

Yoda: Shoe-horned in the movie and felt out of place, acted like gonzo Yoda and talked to Luke like he was a dipshit. It weakened Luke's credibility the way he laughed at him. 

Rose:  Literally felt like a fan fiction character. I was trying to understand her purpose in the movie. She did show me her love for furry creatures and animal rights stance, but other than that? She didn't further the plot in any meaningful way. 

SJW Effect:  My suspension of disbelief was broken constantly throughout because the blatant (and very heavily) shoehorning of unconvincing female characters in leadership roles. I'm not saying I don't want a woman as a leader anywhere in the film, but when you think of military operations in real life, do we see female generals/commanders at every level of the USA, or any other country for that matter?  It just stands out in a bad way I became focused on it. 

Holdo:  Why was she even there?  Why the stupid purple hair?  If she's put in the movie to belittle/set Poe straight, you (the director) need to buildup and establish credibility for her as a leader beforehand to allow this character to talk down to a battle tested pilot with a drive and a plan to save his friends. 

I could go on and on and on. But overall, this film is an absolute mess in my own opinion.  I don't know what else to say about it, but it's really really bad as a Star Wars film.

3448,Why just TLJ?,"This has been in my head for some time, thought I'd pose the question to this sub. As we all know, TLJ has faced controversy, in particular for its treatment of legacy characters and its lack of explaining certain things/refusal to explain them.

But why does this criticism center wholly around TLJ? 

Not that it doesn't do those things for some, but why isn't TFA included here? Why do people take issue with Luke and his death, but not so much with TFA Han, who abandons his family and dies without much redemption for them other than some sympathy for his son? Why is Rian Johnson now responsible for putting Luke in uncharacteristic exhile, when it was Abrams and co who put Luke there, and turned him into a macguffin? Johnson has said in extras on the blu ray that he was trying to find a way for Luke to be on the island ""without being a coward"" ('Balance of the Force' special feature), does this imply the original plan was Luke fleeing in cowardess? 

Are fans equally as irritated in retrospect by TFA now? As an observer it seemed that on release, TFA was generally loved, then in lead up to TLJ it was reassessed as more lukewarm, then after TLJ it's treated with less anger, second only to Rogue One as least hated. Is TFA not to blame for the resetting of the rebel/empire status quo, thus nullifying the events of the OT?

Just wondering, not because I'm trying to defend TLJ, but because I'm legitimately interested in whether I'm seeing this wrong. Are fans annoyed with the sequel trilogy in general, or is TLJ wholly to blame? Or did TLJ only exaggerate issues, but to the point where many give it so much blame they don't acknowledge the clear input TFA had?",StarWars,1530908589,tomatowens,192,52,True,2018-07-06
3449,Has this sub forgotten about how TFA was hated by tons of fans and kept being trashed as a remake? Why is it suddenly being praised and treated as if TLJ was the issue?,"People keep saying “TFA wasn’t treated this way”. Fuck yes it was. Go look at threads from the entirety of 2016. 

All about how TFA was an unoriginal reboot, how it trashed the OT characters, how it was “ANH 2.0”, etc.

And leading up to ep VIII everyone said “just don’t make it a carbon copy of ESB please”. I don’t recall anyone loving Snoke after TFA, rather people thought he was a stupid Emperor 2.0 for the sake of having one. 

Why has this sub forgotten all the huge backlash from TFA and are currently treated TLJ like it ruined everything? 

I like both movies but most of my complaints with the ST stem from TFA, as do most of the common complaints I hear about TLJ.

Rebels vs Empire 2.0 = TFA

Luke a failure that goes into exile = TFA

No big 3 = TFA

The fact that Star Wars already doesn't follow Newtonian-physics not withstanding....

1) We know that ships in Star Wars have some kind of internal gravity, because people aren't floating around in their ships.

2) We know that ""open holes"" to the outside of bay doors are somehow environmentally shielded, as evidenced by Tie Fighters flying into Star Destroyers without sucking people out into space and because people aren't wearing space suits and oxygen masks on the deck.

Given these facts, when Paige drops the bombs, they would fall ""down"" within the ship (just like we saw the detonator fall, as well as Paige herself).  Then, once those bombs cleared the invisible barrier of the bay door, they would be in space and would continue in their direction of travel.

3462,Clearing the air. Actors vs Social Media,"I very recently made a very unpopular comment on a thread in this sub. I commented that I felt that the bullying of Star Wars cast members on social media was wrong, but that I felt they should learn to ignore/block the fringe crazies, because as sure as the sun doth shine, they’ll always be there. This spawned a thread that condemned me of victim blaming and downplaying cyber/bullying. I stuck to my guns and got more and more entrenched in the argument. Eventually it devolved as do most threads of that type. I was personally insulted and attacked.

That didn’t bother me. Mostly I was disturbed by the interpretation to my original comment and that it was being applied to all those that were and are bullied, despite the reference in the post being to actors who make their living from being in the public view.
I find it regrettable that actors of this beloved franchise feel they have to leave social media to avoid an overwhelming tide of vitriol and hatred. I feel that any personal attack on social media is wrong and only speaks to a person’s insecurity or lack of definable argument. I also feel that threatening or defaming a person ought to be condemned and punished.

However, I also believe very strongly that ignoring the vast majority of detractors is a wise way to live. Excepting threats of violence, damage to property and defamation of character, it is my experience that bullies just want attention. I can support a celebrity’s desire to leave social media due to this constant barrage of bilge from the vocal minority (made up even less of those that desire harm to the person). 

I do get tire of being reminded how much the fanbase of which I am apart has trodden down the creator’s/actors in the franchise. I have no problem with people quitting social media over legitimate harassment. I just feel there are a lot of us out there that get hammered when we critique a character or story with references to actors quitting social media because we express displeasure with creative decisions or an actor’s portrayal. 

You may agree or disagree with these sentiments, either way, may the force be with you.

TLDR; Bullying is bad. Punish/stop it where possible. Try to learn to ignore the crazies and you’ll find life more enjoyable. I didn’t personally attack any actors, but I have criticized creative decisions and performances and that’s okay.

I grew up with the franchise, purchased and received hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise. Seen all the movies in theaters (except Solo) this Franchise is very dear to me, but I don’t think I can support it any longer for multiple reasons. 
1. I don’t like Disney’s control of the property and the people running it, 
1A. I do like TFA, Rogue One and Rebels however.
2. I don’t like how they scrapped all the (legends) when they could have easily made movies and shows on them and would have IMO been much more successful.
3. All the Hate and Toxicity towards the Actors from the fanbase( I myself have had some shots thrown in towards the movies and the Runners of it Especially Kathleen Kennedy) but I understand they wanted to take it in a new direction, sadly I feel that direction is bad and to busy driving today’s society home. 
4. The amount of movies we are getting we aren’t getting a break in between, at least the MCU movies are different and actually make you want more I have SW Fatigue 
5. I hear a lot it’s aimed at Children, since when? It wasn’t always sure they have shows and toys for kids but it’s for everyone.

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
There is no passion, there is serenity.
There is no chaos, there is harmony.
There is no death, there is the Force.

Luke failed to live up to this code when he thought about preventing Kylo from destroying everything he loved,  and that backfired on him instantly. So maybe part of his thought process was that,  ""fine, I'll follow the stupid code, but I'm not happy about it."" And during this internal crisis he went searching for answers from the Jedi texts because it all felt so wrong.  It was clear he was still struggling these ideas,  because he was reluctant to burn the tree.  

Ultimately, if not for Luke leaving,  BB8 would never have ran into Rey.  Luke reluctantly followed the Jedi code,  and the force brought the Resistance Rey. ",StarWars,1530955539,I__Jedi,46,26,True,2018-07-07

Meanwhile, Rey will be continuing her training under the guidance of Luke. She will be visiting a few key locations from the previous trilogies. Kylo’s motto is to kill the past, while Rey will be embracing it. 

The climax of the film will take place on Tatooine, where it all began. Kylo will find Rey on Tatooine and he’ll think that he has finally cornered her. But in reality, she was waiting for him. She lead him to the place where he’d have to confront his family’s legacy.

Sometimes Star Wars is truly the only thing that makes me happy. Basically my life has been revolving around Star Wars. It defines me, if you will. It's the thing I loved most in the world. I was so worried about not getting opening night tickets that it was stressing me out, but I did. 

I spent so much time reading rumors and theories on StarWarsNews.net. Counting the days down from 2014 to December 2015. At the time I was a college graduate working a retail job at a K-Mart, and not too happy about it. But this new movie would give me hope for my life! It would be amazing! And for the most part, it was the first time in the theater. Then all of that starts to wear off. And has worn off over three years. 

Somehow I thought teaching was the right career path for me and I got into graduate school. But I was so worried it would be too much work and I'd miss the opening night of Rogue One that I deferred one year. You can only do that once. Then the next year I withdrew again because I thought I wouldn't be able to make the premiere for The Last Jedi if I had graduate level courses. I might miss opening night if I had class, or when tickets went on sale if I had class or an assignment. It might sound crazy, but that was my reasoning. Nothing was more important than Star Wars. And that first night? I did love TLJ! And the few times after.

But now the more I read about it online on Reddit, I realize how awful it truly is. And the sequel trilogy as a whole. Everyone is to blame: JJ, KK, Lucasfilm, Disney, and RJ. These films were rushed, and relied heavily on our nostalgia to give us the illusion of great films that will stand the test of time. They won't. It's awful what they did to Luke's character because JJ and Kasdan couldn't fit him in the script. And Rian took it one step further. Luke could have been reluctantly training her, seeking ancient wisdom, constantly meditating and trying to figure things out...the possibilities are limitless! But look at what we got!!!!

This is the last time we will EVER see Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in our lifetimes again, and this was the best and most creative they could gives us? It's utter crap. I love the man. All I want in my life is to meet Mark Hamill and talk to the man, because he is who I look up to, not the ST Luke. I also do look up to the OT Luke. I wasn't a person who agreed with ""they destroyed his character!"" at first. I loved TLJ. Saw it five times in theaters and didn't see a single flaw. I was wrong. It's going to be very sad once Mark and Harrison pass away, and these films didn't do their legacies justice, or their characters'. I dread that day. More care should have been put into the narrative. I stay up late at night and can't sleep because I'm thinking about how the entire sequel trilogy could have gone, and how robbed we've been. It honestly makes me cry, and I'm not afraid to admit it. It's something that would always get me out of a dark hole (Star Wars), but now it's not. Now I'm depressed because it could have been greater. The ST was the time to expand on the OT. It just demolishes it instead. I'm sitting at home with no summer job, no vacation plans, no friends, and just miserable that the greatest story every told by George Lucas wasn't given the care it deserved.

3500,My analysis of TLJ and some things I would have changed (not a hate-filled rant),"I disliked TLJ for a multitude of reasons:

1. Luke's character change, instead of broken or angry about the tragedy he appeared to be disinterested in the whole thing. The trailers presented a grim image of the future with the whole ""its time for the Jedi to end"" thing which they could have taken in a myriad of different directions and it appeared, at least to me, that they took the easy route.

2. Snoke, you build this guy up as being this trilogy's Palpatine, and he just gets axed pretty much off-screen. which was a giant misstep in my opinion. 

3. I like Rey, I think she's a great character, but I feel she was underutilized in this film. This was the training and learning section of the series for her and she didn't have some major fight with the main villain but rather his henchmen and then lifted a few rocks at the end.

4. Rose, not a fan, dialogue seemed forced and unnecessary at times, and I think all the press about her being this new great character hurt her overall approval because it just wasn't like she did all that much in the grand scheme of things. 

5.  The whole ""mind connection"" thing between Rey and Kylo was just odd to me. Didn't make sense that they were throwing this like sexual tension between two people who should definitely hate one another considering how episode 7 ended. 

6. Leia's space flight. was an odd scene as she was only ever hinted as to have some sensitivity to the force and now she's flying through space. Honestly, I think it would have had a bigger impact if she had done the self-sacrifice and jump to lightspeed through Snoke's ship as a last act of heroism.

7. Finn's Independence Day moment getting thwarted. Definitely some potential for a ""hello boys. IM BAAAAAACK"" sorta moment that would have had some real impact with the crowd and could have had a major impact on Rey's character development.

8. Kylo Ren as a character, to me, seems too whiny. In seven it made sense as he was having a major emotional battle within himself, but in eight after killing his father his character didn't appear to change vastly. I feel like it would've been better for him to become more deranged and emotional, yet he became somewhat more sheepish. although I think the aim was to have him appear this way, it just didn't come off that way to me. 

9. The Kylo/Luke storyline was not a great one. Seemed like a ""cop out"" sort of story. their battle at the end also seemed a little too much like a ""step up"" dance battle rather than a life or death fight. Say what you will about the prequels, but the choreography for the lightsaber duels was impressive as hell. With the technology filmmakers have now I'd imagine they could do even more. 

10. Benicio Del Toro's character felt like a forced add-in of an accomplished actor. Feel like with his talents more could have been done there. In the same vein, Gwendoline Christie's ""Captain Phasma"" just reappears with no explanation and then dies via fall damage. Brianne of Tarth deserved a more badass going out, but who knows maybe she survived this too somehow.  

11. Poe Dameron's character also took a hit for some reason. He's presented as this badass pilot, and then in eight, he's irrational and somewhat like an ""idiot flyboy"" i.e. tom cruise in top gun.

Overall do I think it was some cinematic travesty? no. I had really high expectations going in and came out disappointed, but that happens. I saw it a couple times to try and figure some things out and these 11 things really got at me in my thinking about the film. ",StarWars,1530983645,NYRangers1993,4,1,True,2018-07-07

3510,What would you change and keep about The Last Jedi?,"I had a loooong discussion with my film critic friend and while we disagreed on some points we agreed on many others. About things wrong withe movie.

It's waaaay to long given the narrative . I don't remember how long phantom menace was but it's narrative was escape the planet, regroup, return and retake the planet. TLJ was ""We're being chased""

No CGI just for CGI i.e the casino scenes.

Rose is my favorite character and I've still not seen TFA that said an argument between her and someone older with her like ""You have no heart all you care about is logic and tactics"" and someone calling her out that heart and feelings are the spark but without thinking to follow through it dies. "" Those Animals will be recaptured. Those child slaves will be beaten for the escape. You only made yourself feel better."" And again she's my favorite character but all heart has it's drawbacks.

Holdo attacking the fleet immediately instead of  standing on the bridge wishing someone invented autopilot. Also telling her plans ahead of time since not once did anyone raise the idea of a more in their midst.

A less ineffective ginger Draco Malfoy

Snoke not being a Howard Hughes knockoff

Getting some actual comedy writers for the humor and not Seth MacFarlane for the holding for general hugs thing. 

My friend said Finn and Rey had more personality in TFA I'll take his word for it IMO their purpose is for guys watching to imagine they're Finn and Women to Imagine they're Rey. Like tbe protagonist of s video game is vanilla so you can give your own motivation and personality to them. We disagree on that.

The significance of the dice we came to a conclusion that most characters have a symbol. Luke's saber, Chewies bandolier, Rose's necklace, etc Hans blaster was gone so the fuzzy dice being symbolic was ok even if it was kinda forced.

My friend wondered where Luke's robot hand went

If the Casino scene was necessary do not have it when the Villains are tailgating you ( that's the term when a car is right on your ass right?) If the rebellion was stuck in space and the first order was scouring the Galaxy for them that'd be a different story. But if they're clise enough to wave at don't take off for an casino.

Don't make the protagonists actions pointless. If Finn and Rose hadn't gone to the casino Holdo still would have battering rammed and saved the day.

The skeevy guy and the gambler mislead were unnecessary in general. Could have used anyone else imagine if even an unnamed rebellion soldier had been the traitor and not even for money but because they were afraid of rebellion was doomed. 

Although he says Rey became a badass after a couple lessons  I remember her basically struggling to survive while Kylo did the real work. So to me that was the equivalent of Luke leaving dagobah after a few lessons and getting his ass kicked.

Still love Rose's character even if she was a bit dumb.

My friend says ackbar should have made holdos sacrifice instead of introducing then killing a new character without character building. And Leia should have died so Kylo could grow. He also felt Kylo talking about no more sith or Jedi was undermined by immediately acting like a sith and trying to kill the rebels. I'll defer to his expertise.

3514,(Solo spoilers) Rogue One vs SOLO. Their strengths and what they can improve. Would love to hear some thoughts.,"I’ve been thinking a lot about Solo and Rogue One, 2 movies which I really enjoyed, but didn’t think were perfect.

I re-watched Rogue One the other day, and I totally get those concerns with pacing and characterization. I don’t know why, I don’t know what it was, but it really is hard for me to care about the characters. Jyn I care about to an extent because she’s our protagonist, but even she seems a bit lacking for some reason. Honestly, the character I cared about most was Galen Urso, and I think it’s because the actor was just great whenever he was on screen. I liked the other characters, but something just felt off about the characterization in rogue one.

That being said, I love LOVE the plot of rogue one and how it’s executed. It’s weird, even though I didn’t care too much about the characters, to me it feels like one of the most high stake Star Wars movies. I get such a feeling of nervousness, dread, and excitement whenever I watch it. I get sad at every death. Rogue one just always keeps me on edge, especially those last 3 minutes. I think about how important it was to the trilogy and it just matters and feels so high stakes.

Solo, on the other hand, was the opposite. Where Solo absolutely shined, especially in contrast to Rogue One, was the characters. I found myself loving Beckett, Qira, Vos, Han, Lando, and I even loved the minor characters like Thandie Newton’s character and the 4 armed alien. I genuinely gave a shit about all of them and their backstories, and it made the movie more enjoyable. However my biggest issue with solo is that the plot didn’t feel high stakes enough for me. And I know that’s kind of what they were going for, and I get the idea it was just supposed to a be a fun Star Wars action movie, and I genuinely enjoyed it and I rank it highly for that. But I still left the movie kind of feeling “man that was an enjoyable film, but it does feel like it didn’t matter much i the grand scheme.” I hope I don’t receive too much flack for that because I genuinely enjoy it and think it’s a great film, rivaling Rogue One.

Anyways, I guess my point is I loved both movies. They both did an amazing job world building, they were both beautiful films, they both had minor pacing issues, and they both had their own strengths and weaknesses.  

Which do you prefer? How do you think Rogue One could have improved the characters/characterization? How do you think Solo could have made the story feel more “important”, if at all?

3521,Cobra Kai- A Lesson For Star Wars,"Obviously there’s a lot of opposing and equally valid opinions about how the sequel trilogy has fared in treating the classic characters while introducing new ones that take our adventure forward in an exciting way. Comparison isn’t always a healthy way to look at life and art, but it can be useful in learning how to do things better. 

I think Cobra Kai, the sequel to the Karate Kid series, nailed every aspect of what continuing a 30 year old franchise should be like. 

The tone is perfectly updated, while keeping its heart and soul the same. The legacy characters get amazing stories and actual interactions with each other with great call backs and some surprising twists. It takes their characters in new more interesting directions but it all makes perfect sense to who the characters are. Nothing feels out of place for where our classic hero and villain are, AND they turn their dynamic on its head.

Then they add new characters, that carry the story forward to new places, but again with a familiar heart and soul. You end up loving the new characters just as much as the originals. Its tied together so perfectly with little bits of nostalgia peppered throughout. And most impressively of all, the series succeeds without its most rich and popular character, Mr. Miyagi. They pay homepage to him powerfully and the character is missed, but you never feel the emptiness of his absence. 

It’s just perfect and it really shows that continuing a dated franchise, with old and new characters can be done with great success.(Success being defined as everyone pretty much loves it).

Each was a set of short stories about some known but mostly unknown characters set somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy dealing with some troublesome situation.

3532,"I know I'm not the first to say it, but the (canon) Star Wars comics character Dr. Aphra would be a great lead in a movie for both in universe and real world reasons","So for those unfamiliar with the character, this is her [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1570/4597/products/dr_aphra_color.jpg?v=1527227724). Shes a character who was introduced in either the Darth Vader series (highly recommend this series btw) or the main Star Wars comics and was quickly given her own solo series. 

She's an Indiana Jones esque character in that her plots tend to revolve around the hunt for artifacts, but unlike Jones it isn't for a love of preserving the past. Instead it's for profit. She hunts down these artifacts to sell them on the black market.

So let's go with real world reasons why I think she would be good:

1) Diversity. 

Look, personally I'm not someone who typically cares about this either way, but if Disney wants to expands the representation in these films then an Asian female lead would be a good place to start. 

2) Her movies could give us something we haven't really seen before in Star Wars as well as shake up the Indiana Jones film formula a bit. 

Instead of the movie just being the hunt for the artifact and final action scene against he antagonist to claim it, imagine a movie that instead has a third act where the artifact is brought in to an underworld auction house to be sold off, and we then get to see Aphra and her crew try and turn the situation around to end up with both the artifact and the money. Or hell maybe end up losing both. You wouldn't need to do the normal Star Wars formula of ""THE GALAXY IS AT STAKE AND THERE IS A BIG ORB OF DEEEEEEATH"". This could not only be fun in itself, but also help keep the star wars films from feeling to same-y
3) You wouldn't have to tie her into the main saga movies at all. Like the extent of it would be ""Stormtroopers might show up"" or something like that. 

And 4): She would be a great gateway into something that alot of fans have been asking for: The Old Repubilic

For the uninitiated, the Old Republic is the time period 10,000 years before the films and was the setting for some very loved video games and books. So why would Dr. Aphra fit this? Well she IS an archeologist. Who better to introduce audiences to the history of a galaxy far far away? If you did a movie or two with her trying to acquire (and sell) an artifact from something like the Jedi-Mandalorian War or anything tied into Revan or anything like that to get casual audiences at least curious or to know that there was a separate time called The Old Republic, and then do a movie that ties into the origin of that artifact.

Now as far as in universe reasons, this one is a bit:

Her and her supporting cast are just fun. A Wookie bounty hunter with a control chip in his head, a murderous and manipulative protocol droid, and Aphra herself. This might sound dumb, but I can't think of another way to word it. She's kinda a prick, but in a fun way.

Though I like almost all SW movies, I will admit that other than R1 I haven't found a single one of them special.   
TFA was decent start, but in itself it did nothing new and just banked on the brand name.  
TLJ did a LOT of new, but almost nothing stick.   Solo is a decent summer blockbuster, but it's a waste as a SW movie. It have no reason to exists other than banking in the 'Solo' name one last time. You can replace the title with some other generic action movie and it wouldn't really matter. 

So, for me, neither the quality or the box office of the Disney Star Wars has been redeeming. 

The last and final job of the president is to find directors that are on the same page and have a consistent vision (a little MCU crossover for you!) for the franchise. Not only had she had major director problems with almost every movie but they have also completely failed to have a consistent plan for the franchise.

Kennedy has failed on every single aspect a president has responsibility for. I have respect for her as a producer but it's time SW have a new creative head that have a better grasp of where the franchise is going and where it needs to go. ",StarWars,1528176000,RedditZacuzzi,58,0,True,2018-06-05

3542,"Solo isnt a failure, and its okay","So i was very underwhelmed with it. The story was okay. The scenes were okay. The acting was okay. For a movie that the director was fired, they had to rewrite it, and reshoot scenes, this is a success. Howard did a fine job. He stuck to the formula which you cant really go wrong with. It was an okay movie. 7/10 all things considered. 

Now where it sucked. I didnt care about the characters. Lots of scenes seemed shoehorned in. But again, all things considered. I didnt feel like it was enough build up to any of the characters. I was expecting something more adult and maybe dark, but didnt get that. They regurgitated a lot of star wars things, like Chewy being in the pit with Solo. It was predictable, like when the girl stabbed the guy instead of solo. I was bored for the first 20 mins. The war scenes were very underwhelming and was surprised as some guy posted this long winded whatever on how amazing they were. I guess as a war movie guy i was very underwhelmed. The story seemed to drag on a bit. The action was kind of weak. In all honesty the film deserves a 6, maybe a 7, but star wars, and they banged out a decent movie. 7/10 Rogue one was better.",StarWars,1528177173,AnthonyDLC,15,0,True,2018-06-05
3543,(Spoilers) It's possible for THAT character to appear in the Kenobi movie.,"Maul.

Personally, I don't care that much for Rebels (why prevent a sequel to an epic fight just because of an animated TV show?) and I wouldn't mind if *Kenobi* ended up being a Maul vs. Obi-Wan revenge story (with Qui-gon as a force ghost?). That sounds awesome to me. But there's one thing that we desperately **NEED** in these new movies, and that's a good lightsaber fight. What better characters are there currently than Obi and Maul for this?

While I don't care that much about Rebels, it's still possible to have another live-action Obi-Wan and Maul duel without Obi killing him; just make it an encounter that takes place before the one in Rebels.

I sincerely wish to convey that it is the character of Rose that is the problem and not you.

That sentiment has come to be after the dust has settled and people are more open about the movie. I feel like Kelly Marie Tran has gotten the short end of the stick by being cast in this abysmal role. As far as I can tell, the Rose character is the only thing fans can talk about and reasonably agree on in the movie as being awful. Poorly written, poorly executed, and totally unnecessary. It doesnt help that some fans take it to the absolute extremes by posting honestly just some vile stuff online. There are videos from interviews with her where she is a fan just like us, got to live out our dream of being in a movie, and in reality this whole experience has probably sullied it for her.

All in all, of course there will be fans who push the envelope on franchise abuse but especially in this case I think its fair to say this in this case. Rose is bad, and is an indicator of poor writing at Disney, KMT isnt.",StarWars,1528178439,NiceGuyPreston,8,2,True,2018-06-05

The current narrative of the media seems to be that people who are boycotting, or at least REFUSING to watch Star Wars, are only a fringe minority. Yet every single comment section of every internet article that even mentions Star Wars is lined from top to bottom with fans crapping over anything from The Last Jedi onwards (Solo and every upcoming movie).

So I want to know, just how big is this Anti-Star Wars movement? The internet pundits say they’re very small, yet every comment I’ve seen since TLJ on the internet seems to be the equivalent of a middle finger towards Disney and LucasArts.

Its then revealed that he sold the resistance out. DJ was alongside Finn and Rose since Canto Bight, and he was with BB-8 securing the yacht so they could flee.

3559,I actually think the Solo movie is the best Star Wars movie since the original triology,"I am not sure why, but I found myself pretty amazed when I watched it last night. I loved it to bits.

Perfect “flow” no boring moments etc. 

I loved how the actor that played Han Solo played. I have no clue who he is etc but I kinda felt that he “IS” Han Solo and how I want Han Solo to be. 

Part of me has always felt that Harrison Ford was to “distant” and maybe he came across to me as someone who did not really give a shit. I never really liked Han Solo before the movie last night but now he is my Hero! A character that’s deep down an extremely good guy without being fanatic like most of the jedi are. 

I also loved how the friendship between solo and Chewbacca seems soo true and sincere, something I kinda never got from the “Harrison Ford” version of solo. It actually got me all teared up cause I felt it was soo well played. 

I also loved how Han killed the “white man cant jump actor” in the end, and then rushed over and you could see how deeply saddened he was that he had to do it. Jesus Christ that’s a true hero right there. 

Han Solo came across as someone I look up to. Someone I would have been a best mate with. Someone I would have been proud to know in real life. 

So more of him please Disney!!!

And the movie as a whole I also loved. Sooo many interesting characters with good actors. 

And I know I piss on some folks feet when I say this and I am sorry it’s just how I have always felt......I actually don’t like light sabers. I dunno why but I have always felt it as something silly. And the whole Jedi “theme” is something that makes me cringe as something fanatic and dangerous.

3560,A potential Cost-Benefit Analysis for Disney,"As an analyst myself I would imagine someone in Disney did a cost\-benefit analysis on the amount they would typically spend on marketing a movie like Solo, the amount of BO they would lose by cutting the marketing budget, the amount they may lose on their other big tentpole movies \(TLJ, Black Panther, Infinity War\) if Solo was sufficiently hyped vs gains by not hyping it, and it came out more beneficial to spend what they spent and take the losses. The damage to the brand is minimal I think, especially because the movie is generally well received quality\-wise, which if they favored marketing over reshoot costs and delivered a turkey may have hurt the brand a lot more in the long\-run since its only Disneys 4th SW movie in 3 years.

I would guess they cut the marketing budget by as much as 50&amp;#37; \(reusing assets for posters, billboards and trailers, shrinking the marketing window\) to limit costs and help the BO of other movies \(mainly TLJ and IW\). For the sake of argument, lets assume a scenario where Solo spent the usual budget for marketing \(300 million\), and the hype was high. Could this have reduced interest in TLJ? Possibly marginally. Theyre both Star Wars movies after all. For Black Panther? Doubtful, due to differences in release dates and subject matters. Infinity War? Most likely, due to the closeness in the release schedule, and the prominence of the franchises. Lets just assume a modest decline in the BO returns for TLJ and Infinity War

TLJ: Budget\+Marketing: \-550

Solo: Budget\+Marketing: \-550

Infinity War: Budget\+Marketing: \-600

Total Cost: \-1.7 billion

In this scenario, people are sold on Alden as Han, and interest in the movie builds months before even TLJ is released. Some are more interested in Solo than TLJ, and have it more on their radar than TLJ, some limit rewatches to wait for Solo, and some don´t change their habits. Same thing for Infinity War: some are perhaps more excited for Solo than IW, and and adjust their theater budget accordingly. These are potential returns for the films

TLJ: 1.2 billion \(\~10&amp;#37; less than actual\)

IW: 1.8 billion \(\~10&amp;#37; less than actual\)

Solo: 800 million \(\~50&amp;#37; higher than projected BO\)

Gross Benefit: 3.8 billion

Net Benefit: 3.8 \- 1.7 = 2.1 billion

In this case, however, Solo still has competition from Deadpool 2, and Incredibles 2 and Jurassic World 2 are still on the horizon, so it opens big but has modest legs, yet still earns around 300 million more than in our current situation. However, that 300 million ""bonus"" as it were in BO and profit only comes at the expense of a higher marketing budget, and modest but still noteworthy lost returns in TLJ and IW \(around 350 million in my example\). 

Solo: Budget\+Marketing: \-450

Total Cost: \-1.6 billion

Box Office:

TLJ: 1.33 billion 

IW: 2.05 billion 

Solo: 500 million 

Gross Benefit: 3.88 billion

Net Benefit: 3.88 \- 1.6 = 2.28 billion \(180 million higher than in hypothetical\).

Say they spent more money and time in the Solo marketing, the opportunity cost in the modest losses in other movies´ BO probably outweighed the worst case\-scenario for Solo in a number of hypotheticals. In my example they gained 180 million dollars by marketing the way they did for all three movies, and once the media discussion cycle moves on to how great Incredibles 2 is but how it still doesnt quite live up to the original, or how Jurassic World 2 is the worst of the franchise, etc, Episode IX  and all their other SW projects will make Solo look like a modest disappointment in the long run.

Look, you can think want you want about The Last Jedi and the direction they went, I'm not here for that. I'm just here to say that; Rey absolutely DID NOT beat Luke in that fight. Don't believe me? Watch it. Watch how he handles the fight, 2 handed staff against an antenna, and easily disarms her. He stumbles back when she gets the lightsaber, because it's a fucking lightsaber! There's stairs behind him and he trips, but catches himself mid fall to be sure he's ready to continue fighting. Then once she lowers the lightsaber and calms down, he also lowers himself down because the conflict is over. He never intended to hurt her, he was just defending himself against someone he knew didn't mean what they were doing.

Imagine a little kid was mad and punching at you, and you were blocking them, pushing them back ect. They're a little kid, you have no intention of laying them out on the floor. And then they grab a knife, you're going to back off too. Does that mean the kid beat the shit out of you? No! It just means the kid brought a knife to what was barely a fistfight.

3577,Why I now like The Last Jedi more than The Force Awakens,"Yesterday I had a Star Wars movie marathon. This gave me a chance to re-watch The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi back to back. 

What really surprised me is that I enjoyed The Force Awakens the least in this marathon (which didn't include TPM or AOTC). I also found that I now enjoy The Last Jedi way more. I've actually been enjoying Force Awakens less the last few times I watch it, and now I love The Last Jedi the way I did when I first saw it in theaters. So why the change?

To answer that here are a few reasons why I now like The Last Jedi more than The Force Awakens:

1) TLJ looks and feels more like Star Wars - The Force Awakens certainly captured the fun, pacing, and tropes of a Star Wars movie, but I realized that it feels out of place compared to George Lucas' movies. It's kind of like the 2009 Star Trek reboot. It's a great movie, but it's not a Star Trek movie, it's J.J. Abrams' version of a Star Trek movie. It's the same with Force Awakens. It's a good movie, but it's really Abrams' version of a Star Wars movie. This would be okay if it were a stand-alone movie or a full reboot, but it's part of the Skywalker saga and a direct sequel.

The Last Jedi, to me, looks and feels more like a Star Wars movie, while still being new and having its own unique style. It also takes influence from different philosophies, anime, classical myths, etc to tell a new story, so it actually feels like the kind of movie George Lucas would have made (but still good). So to me it fits with the rest of the saga as a whole. To other people this may not be a good thing, but to me it feels more like Star Wars. 

2) The character are better in The Last Jedi - I just found myself liking how the characters were done in TLJ. Rey's story is more interesting because she has ton learn about the Force and how to control her power, and she has to move on from her past. Her dynamic with Kylo Ren is awesome, who I also liked more in this movie. He seemed more human, but he was also more intimidating. I also like Finn and Rose working together, don't know why, just did. Also, Snoke is way more interesting because he's actually allowed to have a personality. He gets angry, he mocks people, he plays with their emotions, and he does an evil laugh. Now compare that to TFA where all he did was act like a threatening figure and occasionally get mad. Also, his CGI is done so much better in The Last Jedi. We may not know who he is, but at least he was a fun character.

3) The Last Jedi took chances that paid off (in my opinion) - The Last Jedi differs from The Force Awakens in that it does something more original. Not only that, it did quite a few things no one would expect a Star Wars movie to do. Since this post is long enough already, I'll just talk about the big one:
- Luke Skywalker's character: I actually really liked this take on the character. If you think about it, Luke has actually learned his lesson from the OT. He no longer seeks a fight, he uses the force for knowledge and defense, etc. The problem is that he's taken this to an extreme because of what he's been through. People forget that what made Luke so compelling in the OT was that he was the normal person guiding us through the story, but he grew into a better character with each movie. Well, your story doesn't stop when you're young and everything is great. You get old, bad things happen, you lose your way for a while. However, Luke is able to overcome his grief and to save the Resistance and ignite a spark of hope in the galaxy. I also like how the movie sends a message about repeating the past. Luke tried to restart the Jedi Order, but he tried to do the same thing as the old jedi and so he got the same results. Same with the Republic, they tried to go back to the old model and now they're once again being taken over by an evil Empire. So Yoda's speech about failure and how, ""We are what they grow beyond,"" really has a lot of merit.  It's not the Luke we were expecting, and certainly not what I would have done, but I think the movie is stronger because of it.

So those are my ramblings on why I now like The Last Jedi more than The Force Awakens. Not sure if this will make sense to anyone but me, but at least I tried (Yoda: ""Even have to say it, do I?"")

So what do you guys think of the points I made? Do you agree or disagree? Which do you like better? Or do you like them both? (many people seem to forget that you're allowed to do this with new Star Wars movies). Whatever your thoughts, let me know in the comments.

3601,I miss the days of only consuming Star Wars content and not reading about it online (long post),"*Warning: very long post*

I was born in the early 90’s and have been a SW fan from a very young age. 

I grew up watching the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS and I was a huge fan. I played Rogue Squadron on N64 and I’m pretty sure that I watched some of the weird Ewok cartoons.

Then, when I was about 7-8 years old, my dad told me that there was a new Star Wars movie and took me to watch it. It was Phantom Menace, and I had heard nothing about it before. I watched the film and was blown away at everything. A simile thing happened a few years later when Attack of the Clones was released...it was a sudden, unexpected trip to the movies that rocked my world.

It wasn’t until about the time that Revenge of the Sith was coming out that I realized the reviews for the first two prequel movies had been very bad, and I was confused because all five existing SW movies (and lots of video games) had been a huge part of my childhood.

Regardless, I still ended up loving the original and prequel trilogies dearly, and because of the time period that I grew up in, they felt directly intertwined.

Nearly a decade later...
When Force Awakens was getting ready to come out, I was insanely hyped and so was everybody in my circle of friends. The thrill of watching that movie in the theater was amazing, and I was on the edge of my seat for the important scenes. Everybody I talked with in person was equally ecstatic about the film.

And then, as I scoured the internet constantly to discuss the film and anticipate what comes next, I discovered all the complaints about the structure and reused themes of the film. I understood them but I still loved the movie.

And then, on the road to Rogue One, there was all the troubling talk about production issues and reshoots. I ended up loving the movie (one of my all-time favorites of the series) but the hype was stifled by that discussion beforehand.

I was incredibly hyped for Last Jedi and my first time watching that movie in theaters blew me away. And then I got online and discovered all the ways that the film was being picked apart. It became impossible to unsee the criticisms of the movie when I rewatched it, although I still love it more than most.

The road to Solo was fraught with drama, and the box office results have been terrible. This is sad, because my theatrical experience of the movie took me back to the joy I felt watching the prequels in theater as a young kid, but the magic didn’t last long after leaving the movie thanks to all the negative press.

And now, today, there’s the headlines about how toxic fans have bullied Kelly Marie Tran off of instagram. And sadly, she’s not the first person to bear the brunt of this fandom. 

Basically, it seems like ever since some time shortly after TFA, the modern internet era of negativity has really derailed the fun part of being a SW fan. This hasn’t changed my love of the movies at all, but some of the behind-the-scenes magic has disappeared. 

Who else can relate to this?

To recap, the last time we see Maul before Solo (besides his comic series ""Son of Dathomir"") is in Clone Wars. At the end of the Mandalore arc, Sidious confronts Maul and kills Savage Opress. He spares Maul, claiming he has ""other uses"" for him. Could he still be under Palpatines influence in Solo? Qi'ra said ""everyone works for someone else, even Dryden Vos."" She was foreshadowing Vos' allegiance to Maul of course, but it could also apply to Maul still serving Sidious. 

Unfortunately, Clone Wars was canceled before they could finish Mauls arc. But my friend and I were thinking that Sidious still uses Maul as the figurehead of Crimson Dawn to further his own interests; interests outside of the Empire. 

I read another post on r/StarWars recently about someone who noticed Qi'ra was wearing a leather strap on her wrist on Corellia. Was she part of Crimson Dawn the whole time? If so, why?

To make things worse, it’s all justified in some half assed explanation that Kylo’s powers were transferred to her in some sort of mind meld. Which is disappointing because I truly loved having Star Wars be centered around a female lead and feel like it’s a missed opportunity.

I’m not sure if Disney got cold feet with a female protagonist and felt they would get backlash if they made her character naturally flawed but it’s storytelling 101 to have your protagonist faced with problems that aren’t easy to overcome and correlate to said flaws. Instead we got a hero who faces no real consequences, has no real goals, and can defeat everything in her path with abysmal training. 

Which ultimately makes for an extremely uninteresting hero. No hard training, no real consequences, no real flaws and everything is handed to her.


Its pretty clear this film should have centered around Ben Solo and shown his fall to the dark side and destruction of Luke’s temple.

Why do so many people want a Kenobi film?  What is there still left to cover about his life after TPM.  We have the PT, TCW and the comic Anakin and Obi\-Wan.  We have the OT to cover his involvement with Luke and during the in between years, we have a couple of key stories from the Star Wars main comic and we have his very important, yet small role in Rebels.   


Now, I know there is some time to fill in between RoTS and Rebels, but with the two stories from the comics, what more could we want?  I mean, Obi\-Wan survived and so did Luke by Obi\-Wan going unnoticed as a Jedi.  If he has some grand aventure or does something amazing on Tatooine, then that risks the narrative and the idea that he went into hiding.  In the new Darth Vader comic and in the SW main comic, we see that the Empire is doing a pretty good job at following leads and tracking down Jedi.  If Obi\-Wan did somehting that shows he is a Jedi on Tatooine, why wouldn't Jabba sell him out to the Empire?  I just don't see how we can have a good story and a good movie about Kenobi without retconing other canon items or having a story that just makes no sense to the universe that has been established.

You can hate The Last Jedi all you want. But bashing the actors for simply playing the character is wrong. It's not going to get you a better movie, and it's not going to give you what you want. It's not fair to the actors, and it's not fair to Rian to have him harassed on Twitter daily.

The toxic behavior needs to stop, Star Wars is for all ages and it should be for everyone, not just the OT diehards. It's sad to see that a single movie has ripped the fandom in half and it created this massive more ugly side of the fandom. I've been a fan since the prequel trilogy, and I can honestly say the toxic behavior is worse. What I'm trying to say is, be kinder to your fellow fans. Be nice to the actors that do share love for the series, young or old. Don't downvote each other based on which movie you like or dislike. Show the world we are better than THIS.

&gt; Adam Driver: Actually I have not had time yet to fully realize what the fame entails. On two feet, I can tell you that up to a certain point you think your job as an actor is anonymous, harmless like any other, even while people are watching you. 

&gt; Then, suddenly, something changes, they start to stare at you, because they recognize you [from *Star Wars*]. 

&gt; Well, I’m not used to it yet. I do not feel very comfortable off stage or set, or to be the center of attention. At a certain point, you are no longer able to control what happens. You lose a bit of your freedom, and you have to start defending yourself from people, protect your privacy, because they spy on you and feel all authorized to take pictures. [They] take pics, and spy on you, and you you feel powerless in the face of all this. 

&gt; You realize that working in show business involves a continuous invasion by others. I can not talk to you about a real price, because I recognize being lucky, but in a sense...you lose control over your life. [You] become a public domain. 

&gt; I do not think anyone can ever get used to this condition permanently.

Driver also said the following, especially in regards to his ""fame"" from *Star Wars*:

&gt; **Q: Did you expect to have all this success [from 
""Star Wars""]?**

&gt; Adam Driver: No. (Interviwer: *""He stops me even before the question ends.""*)

&gt; My goal when I finished Juilliard was to survive, that is to eat, to allow myself a rent in the city, and pay the bills. To earn enough money to start a family, maybe, but I would not have imagined it even remotely to work with the caliber of artists with whom I managed to collaborate, those that marked my childhood [like Terry Gilliam, Spike Lee, etc...], and for which I then chose to become an actor.

&gt; **Q: Was there a moment when you realized the jump [from anonymity to fame]?**

&gt; Adam Driver: I’m not used to thinking in terms of conquests. What I know is that I’m here [at Cannes], [and] that I did it. 

&gt; There are a lot of things that have happened to me in the meantime. I can tell you that Juilliard was a crucial moment for me [in my life], [and] that I remember the first play on Broadway as an exciting event. I think the *Girls* show was a hit, and I would call Scorsese an incalculable satisfaction, not counting the big titles: *Star Wars* after all, *The Meyerowitz Stories*, *Inside Llewin Davis*. And again, working with Terry or Jim Jarmusch: everything has helped to get where I am.

&gt; **Q: And all this success [from ""Star Wars""], has it changed you? Because you present yourself as a simple person.**

&gt; Adam Driver: Holy Heaven, I hope not! And indeed, thank you, to hear this makes me happy. 

&gt; The problems I had before *Star Wars* are the same as I have even now. It has not solved anything in my life, nor has it made things more or less difficult. The people I met taught me to be malleable, but if you say the word “change”, it gives a negative meaning...I would not define it as my case.

&gt; [...] I always feel like I want to escape from any set. Every time I start shooting a movie, I think I got into a big mess. 

&gt; (Pause, he waits for the reaction, ). Okay, come on, I’m joking. 

&gt; But I’m sure that some days you also go to work  and you think you’ve made the biggest mistake of your life to choose that job. When you’ve got bad habits, you’re out of ideas, or you’ve prepared yourself in the wrong way. I speak in general, not in relation to [my recent filming of] *Don Quixote*. 

&gt; I believe that no film is the result of a miracle, this one is no exception.

&gt; **Q: And was it difficult for you to play the part?**

&gt; Adam Driver: [...] It’s a big challenge, and you can not pretend nothing’s going wrong or it will not impact on what it’s supposed to be make your character. 

&gt; On the other hand, you are not in the real world, and although you are desperately trying to take control of the situation, there is no way to do it. In the end you just have to let yourself go to the circumstances.

&gt; **Q: So [is making a] film stressful?**

&gt; Adam Driver: Of course if you want to do well, but it does not help our work when we feel too much pressure, not only in the case of *Don Quixote*, [but for my other films], this is a rule that is always true: if you feel too forced, you waste energy useful for the success of the interpretation. In that case, it is better that you stop, and take a break.

&gt; **Q: What do you think are the beneficial effects of Cannes on a film?**

&gt; Adam Driver: I cannot tell you that. Nor can I translate it in a mathematical way. 

&gt; I can only sit down like any other person who goes to a festival, and wait for the response that comes from the public and the media. I like the work of the festivals that support projects by directors who, like [Terry Gilliam], encountered many difficulties [in making their movies over the years].

&gt; **Q: Is there a specific method you use as an actor?**

&gt; Adam Driver: No, I do not stick to a method intended as such, if that’s what you want to know. 

&gt; I think the project itself dictates how to set the part. The fundamental thing that I try to do is to go in time with my jokes, so as not to create problems for others, because I know that I am part of a group of people...and that if we do not coordinate, all the cast and crew will suffer. 

&gt; I learned it during the military service that when you are part of a team, it will not work if you are not attuned to others. Complication with all team members then follow necessarily;. If you do not help them do their job, you will also be affected. 

&gt; I try to restrain myself and rebel silently when I need it, so that those around me do not suffer the consequences. Then, you cannot generalize [about things and others]. Every day is different. Maybe you wake up like crap, and you think it will all go wrong, but you’ll be surprised by the result, or you think you have done a great job, and you realize at the end that was a disaster. 

&gt; Every film is really a universe in itself, and the only thing you can do is give your best...beyond that, nothing else.

For those who saw Solo you’d have seen L3-37 who was a droid advocating droids rights throughout the movie. As a Right leaning guy who’s annoyed by feminists as much as the next guy I’d gotta say I thought L3-37 was a great addition to the movie and I found her very funny. Many people say that this ‘SJW’ and ‘Liberal’ agenda is ruining StarWars, and although I strongly disagree with many creative paths Disney has taken I don’t agree with that. In this case I applaud the writers of Solo for bringing in a debatable 2018 idea, with it adding to the plot and entertainment of the viewers, giving purpose, unlike that dumb (in my opinion) casino animal thing in TLJ.

3641,After going to see Solo as second time...," I really loved it.

Solo was a surprisingly fun and satisfying adventure / heist movie. My favorite star wars reviewer describes it as really The Chewbacca Movie.  It captured the mise\-en\-scene of the original trilogy, like Rogue One did, but unlike Rogue One, it managed to make me actually like and care about the characters.  

Some people have criticized Solo film for Han's characterization being slightly off. He didn't emanate his classic ""annoyed by the incompetence around him"" shtick from the original trilogy, but that made sense.  We see a still cocky, but inexperienced, less cynical, and more optimistic Han. Young Han's line from the trailer ""I have a really good feeling about this"" perfectly demonstrates this by contrasting with Original Trilogy Han's frequent utterance of ""I have a bad feeling about this."" It suggests the question, who hurt you Han or what happened to you? Without mentioning spoilers, Solo ends with something of a betrayal that would understandably push Han toward his more cynical self in the OT. The film also ends with a lesson that gets repeated in the original cut of A New Hope and is just perfect. If there is a sequel, and I hope there is, I think we'll see Han becoming the experienced smuggler who Jaba describes as ""the best"" in a reinserted deleted scene in ANH. It would also makes sense for this sequel to introduce Boba Fett and Greedo, so I'm pretty excited about that. I just hope Lawrence Kasdan and his son also write the sequels.",StarWars,1528232294,ALCxKensei,0,1,True,2018-06-05

3646,[Idea] Boba Fett movie: Cad Bane VS Boba Fett as part of a prologue,"I think this would be an awesome way to implement Cad Bane's moment of defeat into the story (since this exact scene did not make it into The Clone Wars TV show \- for those who don't know, it shows how Boba got the dent in his helmet) and immediately give Boba some movie backstory and show general audiences, not just hardcore fans who've followed all of TCW, how Boba climbed up the ladder of the bounty hunter hierarchy. Certain things in the new movies have already shown that they're not shying away from tying the movies to the TV shows, so there's no reason for them not to use Cad Bane in a nice scene (add a Bossk cameo there, too, since he was present) that would then set the stage for Boba's ""origin"" story.",StarWars,1528234374,General_Magma,5,6,True,2018-06-05
3647,What is the Overall Moral/Historical/Mythological Message of the Sequel Trilogy?,"Say what you will about George Lucas, but both the OT and the PT clearly had messages and themes he was trying to get across that tied the films together. In the OT you had George making a modern uplifting mythology for a generation that had seen America's righteousness tarnished by the Vietnam War and didn't have the classic good vs. evil adventures George had grown up on. With the PT he examined how democracies become dictatorships and played off the Hero's Journey beats in different ways to reflect Anakin's Shakespearean tragic fall. 

I'm one of the people who quite liked TLJ and the themes it brought up, but looking at TFA and TLJ together I personally don't see what the connective thematic tissue is yet. What is this trilogy trying to teach the audience beyond what the past films already covered?

Then combined with the western genre, Boba Fett being like Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef in The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly and essentially structure the film around a bounty hunt gone wrong, with Fett’s goal being to hand in a bounty alive, but ultimately getting involved in a plot much bigger then initially imagined - full of other bounty hunters, double crossers, swindlers and a nice R rating.

3655,The Force Doesn't Scale like Physical Strength,"I have seen a bevy of comments about how powerful Rey should be compared to Luke, how powerful Luke is compared to Anakin, about Leia, about Snoke vs. Palpatine, etc etc etc.

No one in Star Wars is asking ""hey bro, what's your max Force Bench Press?"" The Force is not scaled on some numerical metric. When Lucas introduced midichlorians in The Phantom Menace, it was widely derided - the Force has always been a mystical, spiritual power, not one easily understood by a scientific measure. Yes, midichlorians are canon, but they were only in one movie and will probably never show up again. We will never see how many of them Rey has compared to Luke, or Anakin, or anybody else.

A force user demonstrating a force power in a movie is not indicative of their overall strength. Rey lifting a bunch of rocks doesn't mean she's more powerful than Yoda - it means she lifted some rocks. Snoke doing the ForceTime connection doesn't mean he's more powerful than Palpatine, but he might be - we don't know. We just know he initiated ForceTime. 

There is no encyclopedia telling us that Luke doing X requires Y value of Force Strength Units, nor that Rey doing A requires B value of Force Strength Units, and B &gt; Y. We simply do not know.

Really, stop trying to fit the Force into a scale that is easily broken down. It's not. It's a mystical power that holds the universe together. It doesn't matter who your parents are, it doesn't matter where you're from. Anyone can be born with a connection to the force. That has always been the case. Who were Obi-Wan's parents? Who were Palpatine's parents? Who were Ahsoka Tano's parents? Who were Darth Maul's parents? Who were Count Dooku's parents? Are you remembering that familial attachments were heavily discouraged by the Jedi? It's not Jedi having these force-sensitive children, it's random people throughout the galaxy. Luke and Leia and then Ben Solo are not common occurrences of Force-wielding progeny, they're exceptions.

The beauty of the Force is that it isn't a math problem. Just enjoy the movies - nothing Rey does or Snoke does is all that remarkable compared to anything else done by any other character in the PT or OT.",StarWars,1528235854,thirteenpunchman,86,16,True,2018-06-05
3656,Honestly - why do we need an Obi-Wan movie?,"Now, if Lucasfilm formally announces an Obi-Wan movie, with Ewan McGregor in the role, I would be excited. I would speculate abut it, I would turn up opening weekend. Now, I understand that this is all Disney needs of me, and is motivation enough for them to make the film. 

But I often see people complaining that we didn't need a Han Solo movie, and that an Obi-Wan movie would be much better. My question is - why? What would an Obi-Wan story, set during his exile on Tatooine,possibly add to the franchise? What would it tell us that we didn't know before, how would it deepen the mythology and our understanding of the man? We know why he's there. We know who he was before. We know the man he eventually becomes. What else is there to see, really? Would he be fighting off  Tusken Raiders? He's there to protect Luke - would he need to save him somehow? (Remember that the Empire can't ever find out Luke is on Tatooine, and that as far as everyone else knows he's just the young nephew of a moisture farmer. What would annyone want with him? If Obi-Wan has to save Luke, it would be because Luke got himself into some bind either through bad luck or stupidity.) The big, fan-anticipated story of his final showdown with Maul has already been told - and quite well too - on Rebels, and in such a way that makes it clear exactly how Maul tracked him down, tied it to characters on that show, and that Maul wasn't even aware Obi-Wan was alive until shortly before the showdown.  

What new could an Obi-Wan story possibly tell us?

Contrast this with Han Solo, who's movie just came out. He's never been a mysterious character - he arguably has more backstory filled in than Leia or Obi-Wan, and he's a recognizable archetype. Mystery has never been an appeal. But he's someone who is coming off of years of adventures that the movie teases us with, and he was a link to the Star Wars underworld that has been simmering underneath the universe for a while. So a Han Solo movie had the opportunity to fill-out a character's arcs, tell us new things about that character, and explore parts of the universe we hadn't seen before, potentially opening up new stories with new characters. Whether or not it did this well is up to you - but would an Obi-Wan movie offer any of those things, when we've already seen so much of the setting and the man's life?

3660,“Everyone I know had (x) reaction to (x) movie,"Hello, I was reading through the comments on the Rian Johnson tweet post and I came across one that made me think: 

“I'd say maybe 1/8th of the fans hated Rogue one. Totally unscientific but I havent personally ran into anyone that hated it, but saw some flack on here. On the other side, I havent met anyone who actually liked (not tolerated) TLJ. 

My point is, a good star wars movie will be praised and a bad one will not. Especially when you just disregard previously established rules within the universe (ie space fuel/ftl as a weapon etc).

But that's just like... my opinion man.”

Now this was interesting to me because I actually have the exact opposite experience. Almost everyone I’ve talked to things Rogue One is pretty fundamentally flawed as a film, but loves Last Jedi. I think a large part of the issue during online film discussion is that we all think we’re in the majority because the people we know all share our opinions. The problem here is that we’re extrapolating a general truth from a personal bubble. 

For example, the people I discuss film with tend to be my friends, people I have selected because they share similar views/values/tastes. It makes sense that our opinions would align. However, it also makes sense that people with different views/values/tastes would not only have a differing opinion on the film, but also be less likely to discuss said film with me.

In other words, maybe everyone I (or you) know shares the same opinions on x movie not because that is a universally shared opinion, but because I (or you) chose to know them because they are the kind of person who shares my (or your) opinion. 

It’s the same bubble-mindedness that perpetuates homophobia in the South (I say this as someone raised Southern Baptist). For a long time I never even thought of homosexuality as anything but ridiculous because everyone I knew shared the same opinion. I assumed it must be a universally accepted truth because the majority of my bubble believed it. I extrapolated a general “truth” from specific localized experience that proved utterly false. Even using the general consensus of this subreddit is tricky because it’s made up of people with a set of certain similar views/values/tastes.

All this to say, be careful when you use “everyone that I know felt this way” as an argument because maybe the reason that you know them at all is because they’re the kind of person who would feel that way.

3661,The treatment of Kelly Marie Tran is toxic and inexcusable… but don’t let it distract you from the fact that Rose was a terrible character.,"IT’S NOT KELLY’S FAULT. Let’s get that straight. She played the role that was written for her. It’s messed up that many angry fans directed their disdain towards her. Where they SHOULD have directed that was towards Kathleen or Rian. The last thing I’d like to see is have the hatred of her character be brushed off as being a simple brigade from a select few toxic fans. Make no mistake, her character was awful and fans have a right to be upset about the existence of her awful character. Their anger was targeted towards the wrong person though. What I don’t want to see, and what I’m afraid of, is this sub using the belligerent actions of a hateful group of fans to give the writers a pass for creating a terrible character.

STAR WARS ISN’T THE ONLY FANBASE TO CAST OUT A BAD MOVIE.

Look at Leslie Jones in the female Ghostbusters movie. Or Sophia Coppola in Godfather Part 3. It isn’t simply Star War fans being a rude bunch.

3672,"Y'all, there's canonical evidence Greedo is still alive.","I know what you're thinking, but hear me out:

In the infamous scene where Han inarguably shot first, Greedo appears to die; Han fires and Greedo slumps over the table, obviously shot. That Greedo was shot here is indisputable.

However, less than two minutes later, an interesting encounter happens. After selling Luke's speeder, Luke and Obi-Wan head to docking bay 94--and on the way, [they pass someone who looks a little familiar](https://imgur.com/a/LatKYbM). 

That, ladies and gentlemen, is a Rodian who looks *exactly* like [Greedo](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Greedo?file=Greedo.jpg), *wearing Greedo's clothes*.

#####""But what about the smoking hole in his back in the cantina?"" I hear you ask.

To that, I say: ""What about Maul's lower half?"" Maul was ""obviously"" dead, but he survived--with the help of the dark side, true, but Greedo is a Rodian. For us, getting shot in the chest is a one-way ticket to Goodbye Town, but we have no idea what is (or isn't) in a Rodian's chest cavity. It's possible the shot missed any vital organs and, while painful, would result mainly in an inconvenient trip to a medical droid.

#####""But what about this mysterious Rodian's clothes? If this is Greedo and he survived, wouldn't we see the blaster hole in his shirt?""

Not necessarily. Maybe he's strategically covering it with his vest in order to keep the rest of the scum in Mos Eisley from pouncing on him, or maybe he's got it bunched up so you can't tell it's there as easily--or maybe he's just gotten into a fresh shirt.

#####""But why would he change into a fresh shirt after being shot?""

*Because he was planning to fake his own death all along*, that's why! Or it's one option, anyway. I mean, it's risky--how does he know Han won't just shoot him in the head?--but then, for all we know, leaving the hunting business alive would be risky for Greedo for other reasons: Maybe *he* owes somebody, too. We might be witnessing the last-ditch effort of a man to escape a life where he's gotten himself in over his head.

Or maybe it's just a run of bad luck: He never intended to fake his death, but now that Han has soundly humiliated him (in front of a group of patrons in Mos Eisley, no less), he figures he's had enough of bounty hunting and takes the opportunity to let the galaxy think he's dead.

Moreover, if that mysterious Rodian *is* Greedo, let's remember the last place we see him: Passing Luke and Obi-Wan, who are on their way to a *docking bay*. So Greedo is heading...

...*to a docking bay himself*.

It all adds up. 

#####""But what about those Mos Eisley patrons who saw it happen? Wouldn't they see a wounded Greedo get up and leave?""

Yes, but keep in mind this all happened in a spaceport cantina. If Han starts telling everyone he iced Greedo on Tatooine and Greedo (who has gone underground) fails to materialize and debunk his claim, *people will start believing it*--especially with Captain Solo's reputation. Opposing Han's statement (even if you're an eyewitness) would probably just come across as a tall-tale boast; anyone who was actually present for the event is up against a huge bias:

&gt; ""I'm tellin' you, Greedo's alive! I was there--saw the whole thing, then I saw 'im get up and walk outta there myself!""

&gt; ""Sure you did, pal.""

No one is likely to believe a story like that, and more importantly, there's no way to back it up. You think cantinas on Tatooine (or at least in Mos Eisley) keep holos of their customers? I doubt it--bad for business when most of your business consists of outlaws.

So let me address one final question you may have:

#####""Alright, so you've got a theory, but didn't it occur to you that they're just reusing alien costumes for the background extras? It wasn't the highest-budget picture in the world, you know."" 

True, I'm sure they reused the alien costumes for background extras several times in the films... But tell me this: Since we see this background Rodian *one minute and thirty-six seconds after Han's confrontation with Greedo*, why would you as a filmmaker include *Greedo's costume* in a visible shot featuring no other major characters immediately following that character's death? Wouldn't you at least put different clothes on it to differentiate it from the character who just died?

You would, wouldn't you?

*Unless it IS that character.*

Ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case.

3678,Too many Star Wars fans try to justify their hate for the franchise by claiming everyone involved hates it.,"This obviously doesn't apply for everyone who criticises the movies, current or old, as they are not perfect. TLJ had some unnecessary plot points, the prequels have poor dialogue, etc, etc.

But there is a growing amount of people who try to justify not only their criticisms of the new films, but also their outright hatred of them by claiming that everyone involved (Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, etc) hates the fact that these films exist, hates Kathleen Kennedy and hates Disney and quite frankly it's annoying and pathetic.

I was recently recommended a video on YouTube that was a clip of Mark Hamill appearing on The Big Bang Theory and the title claimed that because his shirt poked fun at Disney he clearly hates it and hates the new star wars films, like honestly? How absolutely pathetic is it that you feel the need to justify your dislike of something by looking at minute details of actors clothing or what they say in interviews and twisting it to fit some pointless agenda, just critique the actual films for their poorer aspects and leave the actors out of it, especially when they go on record to say they like the films, which Mark Hamill has done just to be ignored because ""well obviously Disney just made him say that""

And now this small yet vocal section of the fandom is succeeding in ruining peoples lives, just look at Kelly Marie Tran and how the backlash she faced forced her to remove a good portion of her online presence to avoid it. It's just embarrassing at this point to say that I would associate myself with these people and looking at the replies to Ryan Johnson's tweet clearly referencing the situation does not make me feel any better.

But overall, despite the fact that these people cannot be ignored and despite the fact that they try to twist the words and actions of beloved actors, the are in the minority and their presence will fade away as it always does. Please don't take this as me hating on people who dislike some of the new films, they certainly can be criticised, I'm just trying to vent about my disdain for the more toxic and manipulative side of the fandom.

3684,"Don’t Blame Rian, Blame Abrams","Before you break out the pitchforks, hear me out. 

Rian definitely made a lot of mistakes. Casino sucked, closing all of the “mystery boxes” sucked, Carrie Poppins sucked, etc. 

But something that I don’t often see discussed here are the narrative choices made in TFA that may have doomed TLJ’s arc before the script even existed. 

While there are more examples, one major decision stands out: the Luke cliffhanger. 

While the end of TFA was an amazing moment, put yourself in a screenwriters shoes for a second and think of how you would tackle the next film. 

The time skips of past trilogies that allowed off screen character development were never an option here. In order to progress the plot, we NEEDED to understand what led to Luke’s isolation, and that is something you can only do in real time. We couldn’t possibly have fast-forwarded a year or two and had Luke’s downfall and his first interactions with Rey explained after the fact. We left Rey face to face with Luke, and whatever happened next was a pivotal moment that could not be glossed over.

Because of this decision, every single plot line of TLJ was forced to occur at the exact same moment, fifteen minutes after we last left our characters. Consequently, every single plot line besides Rey’s felt forced and lacked impact. 

Think about the second films of previous trilogies. Obi-Wan and Anakin reminisce on the adventures they’ve shared through the elevator conversation. The growing bond between Han and Luke in empire is immediately clear through Han’s rescue efforts, and the “bounty hunter on Ord Mantell” line makes it clear that many adventures have been shared by our main characters. In both cases, the characters have grown and new dynamics have formed between them that weren’t present in the first film of the trilogy. 

Cut to TLJ. Everything is exactly as we left it. RJ is forced to start the film immediately after TFA, and a half assed escape/fleet chase is the best conflict we’ve got for where most of our characters should go. While it may not have been the best choice, you’ve got to wonder what else he possibly could have done to create a real-time conflict that syncs with Rey and Luke’s interaction. 

Imagine if Empire started immediately after the awards ceremony in A New Hope. It would have sucked! Instead, we got a new setting, new conflict, a budding romance, and a new sense of depth to the story. 

You can still blame Rian, but I think it’s fair to acknowledge that Abrams’ cliffhanger was a major constraint for what TLJ could accomplish.

Let’s hope we can close more mystery boxes than we open in IX. ",StarWars,1528245206,GG1126,86,0,True,2018-06-05

3699,Layout for my pre Old Republic Star Wars universe / narrative,"Got bored one night and started writing this from thoughts my imaginations been dwelling on for some time now. I would just like to know if this all sounds good, I’m not particularly interested in changing things as this is just my own head canon really. It’s set in a Star Wars universe where hyperspace travel is a recent discovery, the Jedi and the Sith don’t exist and the republic is in its very early 

The Amalgamate (Or the D.A.P - The Democratic Amalgamate of Planets, which is sometimes called ‘The Republic’ to many free worlds or ‘The Amalgamate’ Among themselves) - This newly formed Democratic government based on Coruscant came about after years of disunity over how the newly spreading influence of the Galactic Centre should be overseen. A Democratic approach was eventually agreed on and implemented after a brief war with The Consort, its ideological opposite.
 
As mentioned prior, this government is the successor to the ‘Galactic Centre’, which had been the central power within the galaxy for hundreds of years, but over the last 100 years there has been constant dispute over how best to administrate the Galactic Centre’s interests. Eventually it was decided by newly elected Prime Minister Alberc that the Galactic Centre should be reformed into a Democratic Republic so that the people would be represented by voted politicians who could bring the people’s word to the ears of the higher ups in order for a more equal and fairly run society and so that the Amalgamate could administrate many worlds by allowing a degree of independence, reducing strain on the stretched resources it requires to manage multiple systems. It’s responsible for the governing of many of Core and Inner rim worlds and also has Sovereign jurisdiction over many worlds in the newly formed ‘Colonies’ which are Protectorates of The Amalgamate. There has been recent expansion into the Inner and Mid Rim, although they are finding it difficult to be accepted with open arms.
 
Despite being a democracy, it has a strict policy of no tolerance towards people known as ‘Malforms’, a rare type of person that seem to be gifted will incredible unexplained skills and supernatural talents such as mind-manipulation and telekinesis which are seen as a threat to the people of The Amalgamate. This has been heightened in recent years after the genocide on Kuat where over 3,000,000 Anti-Malform protestors lives were taken by a group of Malforms calling themselves ‘The Ascendancy’. They’ve not been seen or heard of since the event.
 
The constant venture into new space means that many threats emerge however the Amalgamate suffered heavy military losses during the war and has suffered from a stagnant economy, unable to recover from the costs of battle. It is seen as weak at the moment by its opposing nations throughout the galaxy and is becoming increasingly wary of the Mandalorian’s build up of arms in the Outer Rim.
 
The Partisan Consortium  (Or just ‘The Consort’) -A breakaway faction, opposed to the the idea of the newly formed D.A.P for a more authoritarian nationalistic approach with a single leader controlling all aspects of society and making sure that the Galactic Centre’s interests came first before any other colonised world. They also have a no tolerance policy against Malforms for the same reasons, although are more likely to execute them unlike The Amalgamate who prefer imprisonment for life.
 
They were formed by many high ranking generals, politicians and big business/monopoly owners who believed that the new style of governance was not suited for a power with such a far reach, stating it would be easier to rule many planets through forcible suppression of opposition, keep other worlds in check through intimidation and have complete control of industry and commerce, all of which they stated would lead to ‘smoother integration’ for new colonies. Business owners however were more concerned with the introduction of human rights laws which would significantly affect their workforces and financial restrictions against monopolies meaning local planet based businesses would be able to flourish without the interference of larger corporations whereas military leaders feared that without the existence of a suppressive power many planets would rise up against The Galactic Centre.
 
There was a brief but destructive war simply known as ‘The Galactic War’ between the two factions where The Consort had the upper hand for a while due to the large portion of high ranking military officials siding with them, bringing their resources and soldiers with them. However after a decisive victory at the Battle of Corellia, The Amalgamate all but wiped out the Consorts naval arm, rendering their armed forces inert without a functional fleet to traverse the intergalactic plain. They were last seen fleeing deep into the outer rim territories and setting up camp in the worlds surrounding the Moraband system.
 
A vacuum of power was left in the upper ranks after the war, but recent intelligence reports suggest a lone, unknown individual has gained control over The Consort using his unmatched skills in persuasion - and manipulation.
 
Free Worlds - The name given to these worlds perfectly describes them, worlds independent from the goings on of the main factions. They either have decided to remain neutral in the galaxy, or are undecided about engaging with the larger galactic community, especially with the goings on within The Galactic Centre. Many worlds have small inter-system alliances and trade routes, whereas some are only beginning to explore the possibilities of hyperspace travel, which all in itself is a mystery to many lesser developed planets. Despite being no where near as large as other factions, that’s not to say they don't have some main stayers on the galactic stage. The planet Alderaan is one of these.
 
Run by the Organa monarchy, Alderaan is known to be one of the few pacifist planets within the Galaxy, with a strong economy based around its incredible scientific prowess and highly competitive but successful education system with many young Aldereanians going on to start successful businesses off world or even working as top end scientists, philosophers, authors or artists. One of the many exceptional if not most pivotal discovery made by Alderaan was the discovery and implementation of Hyperspace travel, which has revolutionised the speed of transportation in the galaxy for the past 100 years, meaning even routes like the Kessel run need only take 40 Parsecs to complete!
 
The planet was known during the war for its acceptance and caring of refugee’s, especially of the Bothan species. Despite remaining pacifist, the high spirit of some young Alderaanians means they will not fear to venture off world and abandon their lives in order to fight for whatever cause they seem just. It is seen a distant ally of The Amalgamate but many are hesitant to join the ‘Republic’ for fear of losing what Alderaan is.
 
On the core world of Tython there are rumours of a haven for ‘Malforms’, and many suspect that these planets might be the whereabouts of ‘The Ascendancy’. The Amalgamate has kept a very close eye on on these worlds, with a delegation of ‘officials’ preparing to go and visit this world in order to see if the whispers are true.
 
The Mandalorians (Commonly referred to as ‘Mando’s in conversation within the Core Worlds)- Hailing from the planet Mandalore, they occupy the territory known as ‘Mandalorian Space’. They are a society of feared and cunning Hunter-Warriors; to come across one on the field of battle would be rather unfortunate.
 
They have a strong code and honour that binds the core beliefs of their culture together. The code could be invoked to settle disputes with one-on-one combat that would conclude with the death of one opponent. Mandalorian clan structure was like a pyramid, with the ruler, or Mand’alor, at the top and the Protectors enforcing their rule. Below them were the political factions known as Houses, made up of family clans. They have come to despise and hate the few Malforms they’ve encounter due to their lack of training but incredible use of skill and agility, as Mandalorians spent life times perfecting their talents. To kill a Malform is seen as highly regarded in Mandalorian society and was also viewed as instant initiation into the Protectors.
 
These people are the main stay power in the outer rim territories, which itself is still somewhat having a power vacuum as the Galactic Centre’s influence is weak if not non-existent all the way out there. However most encounters with them have ended in Skirmishes as the Mandalorians aren’t the best at the negotiation table. They have control over many trade routes and often strip worlds of their resources, but never kill unless it is out of necessity, although that tends to happen a lot.
 
They remained neutral during the war, with many seeing it is a ‘petty showdown between two old Mynocks over a crumbling asteroid nest’ (official words of the Mand’alor himself) however many mercenaries from lower houses and families looking for income were said to have been seen fighting alongside Consort soldiers and star-pilots during the final days of the war.
 
With the recent acquisition of advanced Hyperspace technology from an unknown source, The Mand’alor has recently begun a series of Crusades into neighbouring systems and worlds in order to spread the influence of the Mandalorian way and secure new economic ground against the growing counter ideology of The Amalgamate which the Mandalorians often refer to as ‘The Easy Hunt’. This has led to a call to arms and a build up of military equipment and men, it seems a Cold War is imminent, if they can avoid a warm one.

3701,Star Wars REALLY needs an Imperial perspective film. (Galactic Empire Era),"One of my favorite games growing up was TIE Fighter &amp; X-Wing vs TIE Fighter on PC.  It was always refreshing to think about various missions from an Imperial perspective and it added a lot of breadth to the Galaxy.  Rebels really were treated as dangerous to stability and terrorists, as they no doubt would’ve been depending on who you were in a galaxy far far away.  

Right now the only thing we’ve gotten even close to this is from Rogue One (w/ the character build up of Krennic and the Empire’s relationship to Galen Erso) and recently w/ Solo during his brief stint in the Imperial Navy &amp; Infantry. (That recruitment officer who named him seemed like a stand-up fella).  Perhaps kiiiind of when Luke &amp; Biggs talk about the Imperial Academy but yeah that’s basically it.

I’m sure this has been discussed before on the sub, but how bloody cool would it be to follow the story of childhood friends (future love interests) who grow up in a sector loyal to the Empire early on. He’s the only son of a spice trader or some shit who’s fallen on hard times, she’s the second daughter of the regional governor, a [Moff](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Moff/Legends) in the Galactic Empire.  They grew up hearing about terrorist threats, bombings, maybe one of them could have a personal vendetta against the rebellion- but basically they’d join The Navy for their own reasons- one as a pilot, the other in the officer track.  

You could toss in all the cliches like second guessing the morality of missions, giving orders that’ll put your lover at risk, yadi yada.  It’d also be an excellent opportunity to build out some of the more technical aspects of both the Imperial fleet and some of the inner workings we’ve so far only gotten a taste of.  Not to mention the epic [Space battle potential](https://youtu.be/PN_CP4SuoTU).  &lt;——-TIE Fighter anime short most of you have seen.

Anyway, I know this has been discussed at length but it’s bugged me for decades that it hasn’t happened nor been entertained in any substantial way.  Perhaps with the creative leeway being offered to the GoT boys and Rian Johnson we may one day get to see such a film.

During the race, there was several accidents involving Anakin’s POD racer, resulted in a few of the locals being injured or perhaps killed. Authorities were unable to get further details due to the influences from the Hutt’s Leadership or Clan of the Ancients, who tend to keep their activities secret. Watto was unwilling to take his dispute to the Clan and preferred local authorities to handle his complaint.

Anakin and his collaborator left the planet before they could be questioned in connection to the allegations of race fixing, fraud, manipulation of the race outcome. Any further details of the collaborator or his identity is unknown because the spaceship was hidden away from Mos Espa proper, in the nearby desert. By the time authorities were able to locate the hiding place of the ship, it had already left the planet.

Case: Luke Skywalker – Jubba the Hutt: Tatooine Civil Authority (4ABY):

Report: Jabba the Hutt Murder.

Authorities were called to the desert region, near the Great Pit of Carkoon and the home of the Sarlacc, an ancient desert creature, to investigate burning wreckage that was later identified as the remains of Jabba the Hutt’s floating barge. The remains of the barge indicated there was a fight using blasters and at least one lightsaber along with involving a different flying-craft and multiple people. No bodies were found, likely due to the barge’s crash being in close proximity of the Sarlacc nest. The Sarlacc is known to grab the bodies of the injured or health into its mouth when anyone venture too close to its nest.

Authorities went to the Hutt Compound and interviewed Hutt employees. It is there that they found that Luke Skywalker had returned to Tatooine and attempted to steal a prized artifact from the walls of the local leader, Jubba the Hutt. Luke is also known to have killed Jabba the Hutt's beloved pet, the Rancor. The Rancor was a very rare local creature that takes a very long time to grow to maturity. Jabba kept the creature close to him at all times and was a source of protection along with entertainment in the Hutt Compound. Unfortunately, Luke drooped a blast door on the creatures head, killing it.

Jabba the Hutt told his people that they were taking Luke Skywalker and others being held at the Hutt Compound to be chased into the desert for their crimes against Jubba. Luke and others were seen leaving the area quickly on one of Jabba's flying-crafts, away from the burning wreckage. Further inquiries were made but with no one returning from Jubba’s barge or coming forward, it is unknown what lead up to and included the death of Jubba the Hutt.

3722,Rey’s father can be no body and somebody at the same time. Theory [spoilers],"This may have been brought up before, but I haven’t seen it mentioned yet so I’m sorry if this isn’t an original theory. 

I suspect that we have already met Rey’s father in the films, but I don’t think Kylo was entirely wrong about him. He’s a nobody, a drunk that abandoned her for gambling money, but he’s not dead yet. Though, perhaps her mother is. 

I suspect that Rey’s Father is DJ, Benito Del Toro’s character from the Last Jedi. I was trying to think of why this character would be introduced. Obviously we know his function in TLJ, but he never gets his comeuppance. There are no Star Wars villains that don’t eventually get what’s coming, which means DJ must appear in Episode IX. 

The thing is, what purpose would he serve? Obviously the characters know he’s a scoundrel and won’t trust him again, so to have him appear only to be killed and no other reason would be pointless. I suspect he will be captured by the resistance where he will plead for his life, spill his life story, and inadvertently alert Rey that he must be her father. 

I don’t know what the conclusion to this arc would be, whether he will remain a scoundrel and try to betray his daughter to the First Order for money, or if his will redeem himself by finally choosing a side, but regardless, my money is on some version of this taking place.

3727,Just came up with a theory about TLJ,"So, I’ve had a problem with TLJ since I saw it opening weekend. I felt like the story was poorly written, and the characters made odd decisions for no reason. But I think I might have figured out why this is: we aren’t watching the movie as it happens, we’re hearing the story the child at the end is telling!

Follow me on this. The children on Canto Bight probably don’t interact with anyone besides themselves and the people that own them. So when Rose and Finn show up and tell them their story, it’s big news. It’s not out of the realm of possibility to think that they would come up with a big, exciting story based on what little bit of information they have. 
Rose would have talked about the loss of her sister, so she becomes the hero that lets the resistance initially escape the FO. Finn would have talked about Rey, Kylo and Luke, so they have a story crafted around them. And since Finn and Rose are from the resistance, the FO in the story would become incompetent buffoons, similar to how they were in the movie. 

And to help prove this theory, we see the children immediately after the heroes leave Crait, with no obvious passage of time, so there’s no way they could have heard about what happened. How are they able to tell the story? 

I’m not posting this to have a discussion about how I feel about TLJ; I’ve been doing that on here for 6 months and it’s tiring. I’m simply looking for people to either help me prove or disprove this theory. And please keep it civil lol",StarWars,1528258880,Echo12b,3,0,True,2018-06-06

3732,"TLJ Attitudes, A Star Wars Story","Today I posted two infographics on r/starwars, r/starwarsspeculation, and r/starwarsmemes. 

[One was a infographic showing data that The Last Jedi was well received, loved, and financially successful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8ovsxv/tlj_the_worst_movie_of_the_franchise/) The light side argument if you will. 

[The other was an infographic showing data that The Last Jedi was panned, hated, and a flop.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8ox591/the_best_movie_in_the_franchise/) The dark side argument.

[https://imgur.com/a/vIg98pH](https://imgur.com/a/vIg98pH)

It was a ruse to try and gauge the reaction of self\-identified “fans” of the franchise. I wanted to compare the upvote totals, comment amounts, and sentiment of the comments. I believed that if one got more upvotes and positive comments than the other, then this might be yet another way to see how divided the fan base actually is.

After 3 hours on the site for each of the infographics, I think it’s yielded some interesting results:

Between all three subs, the arguments for TLJ received a combined total of 219 upvotes and the arguments against TLJ received a combined total of 1 upvotes.

Seems like a blowout. But not so fast. Out of the 400 comments left on the pro\-TLJ post, the majority were intensely negative. Out of the 28 comments on the anti\-TLJ post, there seemed to be a mix of negative and positive sentiments.

Between the two posts, I think we can infer some assumptions about the fanbase and this movie: The majority of fans liked the movie. (Defining fan as people on the top three SW subs on reddit.) But the minority of fans that don’t like the movie, severely dislike it as opposed to more lukewarm positivity of the majority. In other words, they feel much more strongly about disliking the movie than the group who likes it.

Keep in mind, this is not great quantitive data due to a lot of factors (non\-random, small sample size, and no controls). This is qualitative data intended on driving insights about the fanbase and it’s attitudes about TLJ. 

The great Star Wars fanbase rift of the past 6 months has ignited a culture war among fans. But I think the negative pushback against Disney, Lucasfilm, and Rian Johnson has had overblown impact. This doesn’t mean it’s not a problem. As many have pointed out, Solo might be suffering due to a perception that Star Wars fans don’t like the direction the franchise has taken. But I think Lucasfilm internal polling is telling them the same thing: TLJ pushback is not a majority opinion.

If this is you, you're missing the point. I don't believe anyone who says this means to say that you should harass Rian and Kathy instead, but you're still looking in the wrong place. The lesson we should all be taking away from this is not where your anger is being directed, but how you express it. Anger is, of course, on the path to the dark side.

As far as I'm concerned, you can not separate reality and Star Wars as much as you want, just as long as you be cool about it when something happens that you don't like or agree with. I initially laughed off #boycotsolo, but if you're done with Star Wars than that's a healthy expression, simply don't see it. Talk about your frustrations here or with friends. Write disappointed letters, not hate mail and death threats. I don't know, talk to a therapist if that helps? I don't have the answers, I just hope you can think about what you're saying and feeling, and find a solution that works for you.

3738,So I've been thinking way too much about the Boba Fett movie...,"I've been thinking way too much about the Boba Fett movie, enough that I rambled my way through a Twitter thread outlining some beats on what I'd like to see. 

I thought I'd clean up my rambling a little bit and share it here.

Ever since it was first speculated that there may be a Fett standalone movie, I've always thought its best iteration would be something set between Empire and Return. My dream would be a chase film where the other bounty hunters fight it out with each other and try to catch Fett, steal Han Solo from him, and take the reward from Jabba for themselves. I don't think we need to see an origin story for Fett (we get that in Clone Wars) and placing it between V and VI allows us to, like Rogue One, explore a corner of the saga onscreen in a way we've not seen yet. 

Now two problems I had to overcome in my mind- What is Fett's motivation and how to we remedy the fact that he goes out like a chump in Return? I think I figured it out... (Bear in mind that I'm fully aware I'm probably going to step on the toes of some new canon that I'm unaware of the nuances of since the Disney buyout.)

Open the movie with Fett trying to maintain a secluded life. He's living not in hiding but quietly with his son, paralleling the life Jango and him never got to share. As the story begins, the Fett homestead is besieged by rival bounty hunters trying to collect a price on his head related to some job he had a hand in, maybe have Kanjiklub putting the price on him as a nice tie-in to TFA. Fett takes them down in the brutal style we anticipate him being capable of but he realizes now more than ever that this life is going to separate him and his son in the same way Jango was taken from him. Really drive home the point with Fett having a moment with his armor, we see a spot on his helmet where blaster fire has burned away a spot of green paint to reveal the blue underneath as he's been wearing his father's armor this whole time. 

Let's have this all hinge on a classic trope- The ""One Last Job."" Boba Fett takes up the Empire's job to track down Han Solo (and friends) so he can sell him off to Jabba the Hutt. But he doesn't want credits from Jabba- he wants Jabba to use the Hutt Cartel's influence to get the galaxy to back off, mark Fett as untouchable, let him retire in peace like John Wick tried to. As Fett prepares to leave home he takes a moment with his son. His son is upset but understanding. Fett tells his son that he loves him. His son responds with a somber ""I know.""

SMASH CUT

We see the last look between Han and Leia before Han gets the deep freeze. Fett takes ownership of Han and we're off into space. Fett thinks this is going to be a routine job but it turns into FURY ROAD IN SPACE. 

Zuckuss, 4-LOM, IG-88, Bossk... even Dengar are all after him. One by one Fett evades them before the Slave I is finally, and somewhat surprisingly, critically damaged by Dengar. Fett manages to shoot down Dengar's ship as well and they crashland in proximity to each other on some backwater planet. From there we get Fett and Dengar meeting up in a stand-off before being forced to work together to get off world. Get IG-88 in there with a number of IG-drones hunting Fett on this planet. 

We have Fett and Dengar bond over their time together. Perhaps Dengar is actually somewhat of a Boba Fett fanboy then in a quiet moment Dengar spells it out for Fett that he'll never be able to retire. Does he really think Jabba will let him go? Fett is too valuable of an asset.

So Boba Fett has a plan. Dengar helps him get off world so he can get back to his son, he gives Dengar his armor and lets him go on as  ""Boba Fett."" He never needs to show his face and he gets to be the badass he's always looked up to. Give them a final showdown with IG-88 and get them back into the air. Boba goes home to be with his son, having learned to work with and rely on someone else, and Dengar goes on to... deliver Han to Jabba and get knocked into the Sarlaac pit by a blind guy. 

Thus, we've gotten a badass Boba Fett story, we've retconned his terrible death, and slid a neat little anti-hero story right into existing continuity.

3742,Do you guys completely agree with where the sequel trilogy has taken the general lore of the Star Wars Universe?,"Back in 2015 when I saw TFA in theaters, I was a little disappointed with how the direction of the new trilogy was going in. It felt to me like JJ had set up these new films to take place in the exact same environment as the Original Trilogy. It felt a bit  convoluted as to how the New Republic let the First order build a super\-weapon the size of an entire planet seemingly under their nose. I was never able to understand how a defeated empire which was practically broke somehow had the finances to be able to commission the excavation of an entire planet in roughly 10 years before the events of TFA? 

Why was the Resistance considered an ""underdog"" force when the balance of power was still very clearly in favor the New Republic? Destroying a few key planets that belonged to the NR doesn't automatically mean that the NR is completely out of the fight and the Resistance is all that's left to stop the First Order. Can't the New Republic just raise an actual army to combat the First Order (Kinda like the US in WWI)? Where even was the entire NR fleet when everything was going down?

The Last Jedi also doubled down on the fact that the First Order now controls pretty much the entire galaxy even though the two movies take place minutes apart from one another. In the Beginning of the movie we see the evacuation of the Resistance base with hundreds of small supply ships going up to the the Raddus bucket brigade style. We also see two other support frigates in the movie as well as a fleet of bombers and squads of X\-wing fighters. Near the end of the movie the entire Resistance has been shrunk so small that everyone can fit on the Falcon.

This means they lost the entire crew of the Raddus, a majority of the crew evacuating the Raddus, all of the commanders (except Leia) on the bridge, Both support Frigates, Every single fighter ship on board the Raddus, and nearly every single infantryman and speeder pilot on Crait.

I assume this is why episode 9 is supposedly taking place 5 years after TLJ because I have no idea how they are going to bounce back realistically from these catastrophic losses.

I was personally hoping to see a ship super\-weapon instead of a Death star 3.0. Something along the lines of the Eclipse Class Star Dreadnought from Legends. Something intimidating, more realistic than something the size of a planet, and capable of actually defeating the New Republic. The New Republic would also have updated ship designs akin to the E\-wing fighter and K\-wing bomber as replacements to their X\-wing and Y\-wing counterparts respectively.

This rendition of the First Order could have crushed the combined New Republic Fleet in a huge brawl above the First Order's home planet as the New Republic desperately try to quell this First Order influence before it would spread. General Hux would be an extremely competent (almost Thrawn\-like) commander. This Defeat of the New Republic could throw it onto the defenses and all of our beloved could come out from the woodwork to stop this threat.

What I'm trying to say is I feel like they have missed some really cool opportunities to avoid telling the same general story we've already seen before by changing it up a little yaknowwhatimsayin?

3745,This needs to stop,"My entire life I’ve loved Star Wars. I’ve seen all the movies multiple times, I read the books, and I practically live Star Wars. However, recently, the fan base has turned unbelievably toxic. I really hope it’s a minority, but it’s a very vocal one. The harassment of the people associated with tlj is particularly disgusting. Even if you don’t like the movie, these people are just that, people. They’re just like you and me, and they shouldn’t be harassed because a movie they were in wasn’t exactly what you wanted it to be, and it’s frankly disgusting that something I love so dearly could be twisted so horribly. In fact, ever since Disney bought Star Wars, a part of the fan base has become incredibly xenophobic and toxic. They’re rejecting the new content that Disney is giving us without valid reason. I’m not saying you should love these movies and think they’re the best, but often times the reasons people hate them are shallow and ignorant. They suddenly expect it to be hyper-realistic, and get mad at it for being too political, despite the fact that George Lucas himself created it with politics in mind, wanting to send a message, and handpicked Kathleen Kennedy to take over for him. They ignore key points of the plot and character (especially overlooking the importance of Canto Bight and Snoke’s death). However, I have seen people who just don’t like it, and have their reasons s and preferences, they aren’t perfect movies. In the end, Star Wars if just supposed to be a fun movie to watch and enjoy. This is something that I think Solo hits does really well, and it even has some moments that excited me as a nerd and a fan of the EU. However, because of backlash to tlj some fans are boycotting Solo, despite it being a great movie, whether or not you enjoyed tlj. Disney has given us great and cohesive new Star Wars content and massive amounts of stuff like books comics and movies to enjoy, and we should appreciate this with an open mind, and judge it more objectively, and love Star Wars for what it is.

3747,"I watched the Star Wars movies in the weirdest order possible growing up, not becoming a fan until much later","So I started with Revenge of the Sith, I watched this in the theaters with my cousins and was pretty much following the story without any knowledge but I knew who Vader was. Up until Anakin was named Vader by Sidious I was pretty confused since I was just thrust into this movie not knowing what it was about. But still being vaguely familiar with Star Wars, that was the moment in the movie when I put the pieces together wondering why he wasn't wearing the suit. Until he had his legs cut off and was burned alive, I was ten at the time and my jaw was on the floor.

For some reason i never ended up watching the other movies after that, probably thinking I had seen the best part of the story already. Plus I remember seeing a scene of puppet yoda on my standard definition toshiba tv and being compelled to change the channel. Don't know what was wrong with me lol, I love him a lot more than cgi Yoda now. 

Sometime after watching ROTS, probably a year or so after, I watched Attack of the Clones at a summer camp. As I watched, I remained confused by the film, with others around me referencing the other films. All I remember from the film when I first watched it is all the scenes with Kenobi on Kamino for some reason.

Now fast forward to 2015, I have seen the teaser for TFA but it was like watching any other teaser for me, meh, that was my reaction not because I thought it was bad but because I didn't have any connection to it. Then during the summer I happened upon a youtube channel which would talk about Star Wars, I saw the thumbnail for Kylo Ren and was looking for something to watch while I ate and for some reason I clicked on it. Eventhough I had no interest in the universe or the movie I thought i'd watch five minutes since I was a fan of the panel who I had just started following for movie discussions.

That five minute of theorizing started with who was Kylo Ren and how was he connected to the saga, at that point I was like wait a minute, this actually sounds interesting. So I decided to do my homework and I watched 4,5,6,1,2,3 in that order. Although I wasn't surprised by the big twists, my jaw dropped seeing Hayden Christensen as a force ghost. I was like wait a second, that Anakin.

After watching the movies and theorizing my hype was through the roof for TFA. The wait for the official trailer felt so long but till this day that's the best trailer I've seen. And now I'm hooked to this franchise.

3748,Darth Plageuis and the World Between Worlds?,"I had a thought recently about Ezra's actions in the World Between Worlds when I was listening to a podcast about that episode of Rebels - they said something like ""he can't save Kanan from death"". My thoughts immediately went to Darth Plageuis.

As a massive fan of the Plageuis book, I would be very happy if it was just made fully canon but now that all we officially know about Plageuis is Palpatine's story in Revenge of the Sith, his methods are open to reinterpretation. While Palpatine claims that Plageuis used midichlorians ""to create life"", he doesn't explicitly suggest this was also the case for saving people from death.

Basically, what I'm getting at is, what if Plageuis was using the World Between Worlds?

We saw that Palpatine is well aware of its existence in Rebels and can access it to a very limited extent; it's certainly feasible that Plageuis knew of the World Between Worlds too.

I honestly don't really have much concrete evidence to go by but before I consider this further I wanted to ask whether this idea is contradicted by anything in the new expanded universe with which I'm not very well acquainted. In general, have there been any suggestions of contrary ideas? My other question is whether Ezra and Ahsoka saw themselves in any portals (the latter after she'd escaped Vader). If you cannot directly view yourself in the World Between Worlds, that could be why Plageuis was unable to use that power to save himself from dying.

3751,[SPOILERS]The climax of Solo doesn't make sense with regard to characters' motivations,"I'm talking about the treason of Tobias Beckett. The second one. The first one, betraying Han Solo, is consistent with all Beckett said and done, with his (nor unreasonable) fear of Dryden Vos, and it was hinted here and there in the movie anyway. From the start it's Beckett's motivation to pay his debt to Dryden Vos because he is vicious and powerful, and if he doesn't, the Crimson Dawn will hunt him down. This makes his betrayal of Dryden Vos inconsistent.

 - If he wanted to ""steal"" coaxium, he could do this eariler with less of a hustle.
 - The fact that Dryden's bodyguards were not around didn't make Dryden harmless and betraying him inconsequential. Probably the only way to circumvent it was to kill Dryden there and then with all the witnesses, but he didn't. He only took Chewie and headed... somewhere(?). He had no guarantee that Dryden will not come out victorious from the struggle.
 - Still, is Dryden the Crimson Dawn and the Crimson Dawn is Dryden? If not, Beckett still could have mark on his back, the very thing he tried to avoid the whole movie.
 - There is also Qi'ra, whom Beckett didn't trust, which makes not killing Dryden even more nonsensical.

There is also a minor issue with the twist during the fight with Dryden. For some reason Qi'ra interrupts by blocking Han's blow, but then ""switch"" sides again and fights Vos, eventually killing him. Unnecessary drama in my view.
So, summarizing, I think Beckett held the idiot ball for the drama sake or convenience of the plot (e.g. to pull ""Han shot first"" plot point), which made the climax a little bit less satisfying and unnecessarily complicated.

I can understand that you may have an issue with leadership but no chance Disney's not gonna go from Kathleen Kennedy to someone who has never worked in live action. I like Dave Filoni but I think his time will come a few years down the road. I read that he's involved in Favreau's show and will possibly direct an episode, so he will get experience. I'm reading rumors that it may be Kiri Hart to replace Kennedy which should make Dave Filoni fans very happy since they've worked so closely together.

With that being said, its sad to see the disrespect Kathleen Kennedy gets. She's delivered 4 solid movies which for the most part have been well received. And in the case of TLJ , it's a film that a lot of fans love and a lot of fans hate. But the movies have given these characters added layers and have treated the established canon with respect. Don't forget she' produced countless classics which built the same childhoods many are claiming to have been ruined.

I saw the Star Wars twitter feed wishing her happy birthday today and all I saw were negative comments, saying she destroyed Star Wars as well as a bunch of personal jabs. Especially on the day full of controversy regarding Kelly Marie Tran. I understand criticism, but this level of disrespect and personal attacks is uncalled for.

3760,"""it's not like she wrote the character...""","I know a lot of characters have been typed about the Kelly Marie Tran Instagram incident. I know we're all in agreement that it's abhorrent and embarrassing for Star Wars fans in general that we have to be associated with such cruelty and pettiness. And I know (hope) that those guilty of commenting have never been on this subreddit. 

But I've also seen people on this subreddit say an uncomfortable number of times, something like ""that is so stupid. It's not like she wrote the character.""

And that's missing the point entirely. There is no excuse for harassing someone on social media. That line of thinking excuses the verbal abuse that Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy get online. And it's not excusable. It's petty, cruel, embarrassing and weak. There is no excuse for taking your disappointment in a movie out on a real person through the internet.

Look, I get people don't like the movie. Make your YouTube videos dissecting the character and the writing. Write your essays and post them here. Write on medium. Go to film school, work hard your whole life, get hired by Lucasfilm, and show them how it's done.

But there is absolutely no excuse for taking this language and ""criticism"" to the Instagram comments or Twitter thread of a real person.

3766,Disney's villains are the best part about the new movies,"So, I wanted to add something positive to the subreddit considering the current state of affairs, and I got to thinking what I like most about the new movies. Apart from all the new lore (God, i love the revised hyperspace lore and the world-building), the one neutrals can mostly appreciate too is probably the villains.

Kylo Ren, Orson Krennic and Dryden Vos are all incredibly engaging villains for several different reasons.

The main reason I enjoyed TLJ (apart from the incredible cinematography) would have to be Kylo Ren. Whereas he looked like an impetulent child in TFA, the Kylo Ren in TLJ had significantly evolved in the latest addition to the Skywalker saga. He was still being torn apart by his struggle between light and dark, but in an entirely different manner than in TFA. The difference was not that clear-cut anymore, and especially his interactions with Rey seemed to indicate a redemption story similar to his grandfather. However, despite the hint from Luke (about the sheer darkness he felt within Kylo, even as a kid), it still came as a shock that he turned on Rey after disposing of the imperial guard. Not only that, in that moment, Kylo made an impressive turn to a menacing, imposing villain, no longer struggling but fighting the light with all of the conviction that the Supreme Leader of the FO should have. Frankly, that entire turn and the renunciation of the Light was the climax of Kylo's journey from an indecisive, struggling child to a force to be reckoned with. 

Orson Krennic on the other hand is, for me at least, one of the most relateable Imperials we saw in the very black/white Star Wars universe. Here was a man that had been the driving force behind the construction of the Death Star (you know, one of the most iconic WMDs) in an effort to further both the Empire's cause and his own career. However, a lack of political acumen (and a certain kind of sympathy towards Galen Erso) led to him eventually losing nearly everything that he had worked so hard for. His presence was enough to draw me to the edge of my seat, considering the fierce desperation with which he chased Jyn et al. As his entire career seems to slip through his hands, he is eventually ended by his own legacy - the thing he worked the hardest for was his downfall as well. I honestly can't stress Mendelsohn's work enough to make him a convincing villain.

Even Disney's most recent addition, Solo, had an imposing villain, albeit in a different way than those that came before him. Whereas Paul Bettany could only seem less threatening in the MCU if he were to play a golden retriever, his mere presence on-screen is enough to ensure that he's in the back of your head for the rest of the film. Considering the fact that he had very little to work with, I must admit I was seriously impressed with what they managed to do with the character. Every conversation felt as if the protagonists were treading quickly-melting ice, going along with the superficial, kind mannerisms of Vos. Although Han himself seemed blissfully unaware, both Qi'ra and Beckett's quick interventions signified he was not to be thrifled with. Sure, Maul stole a lot of the impact of Vos, but considering what Bettany had to work with, they really made the most of it.

So in short, I really enjoy the new villains of the Disney era since they're all sort of understandable. They're not just paragons of evil like the Emperor, but they're layered characters with their own motivations (barring Solo, but I like to pretend that's mostly due to the limited screentime).

He'll meet Boba Fett, Greedo and maybe even Watto... So he's got alot of shit to look forward to. Likewise, Obi\-Wan is on Tatooine bored out his mind. We know Maul is alive, so that ought to be fun. We don't know the full extent of the Crimson Dawn yet, perhaps they'll make themselves known outside Obi\-Wan's hut on Tatooine. That's Maul's motivation isn't it? To find Obi\-Wan... that leads the Crimson Dawn to tatooine in Hutt territory. 

You see where i'm getting at? Qi'Ra will now be on the same planet as Obi\-Wan. He's not a member of the Jedi Council anymore... Obi\-Wan a powerful force user, Qi'Ra, skilled in combat... Having a baby, who could that be? Could be anyone...

3770,Why I don't understand people complaining the lack of Snoke's backstory,"I know, I know, I am kinda beating the death horse at this point but I'd still like to share a thought I just had.

Ever since TLJ came out and we saw Snoke being killed, some people have been constantly pissed off by the lack of his origin story in the movie.

To be honest, at the beggining I was kinda on the same boat and I still agree that some backstory for him would be really good to have, but I've realized how early it is to complain about that just yet.

You see, SW has a long tradition of filling up backstories of characters long after their deaths on screen. All the OT character only really got their backstories 16 years after the OT. And some of the PT characters - for example Grievous or many of the Jedi we saw - got their stories in the Clone Wars.

What I mean to say by this is that we should all calm down and remember that TLJ was not the end of the new canon. 

We still have episode 9 comming that could explain Snoke's rise to power, The resistance cartoon that will, in my opinion very likely, delve into FO's earlier days. Hell, we're getting a live action TV show set in that exact period that could very well cover Snoke somehow.

People were boycotting Solo which was actually a really good and fun film in my eyes. It felt very *Star Wars-y*.

Because of the atrocity of TLJ and how all the characters have essentially been ruined with the exception of a few and how there was barely any progression in the film story wise people are going to doubt the next episode.

What is JJ going to do in the next film?

I’m struggling to see what he can pull off because we know certain characters have to die or switch sides and that the good guys will probably win despite there only being about 300 of them...

3777,"Regarding the Bombing Fleet, Poe, and Leia.","Leia is both his commander and the commander of the bombing fleet. Leia is explicitly shown to have communication technology; she's not just blinking lights in the sky in the hope that someone notices, she has an actual radio, or the scifi equivalent.

Leia then orders Poe to call off his attack, but fails to also order the bombing fleet to not attack.

At that point, they had only one fighter in danger. If she'd ordered them not to attack, nobody in the bombing fleet would have died.

But she doesn't do that, despite the fact that Poe is disobeying a direct order. She just accepts that one fighter is ignoring her, and therefore she has instantly lost complete control of the bombing fleet. Is she somehow capable of communicating with Poe, but not with the bombing fleet, despite Poe being able to talk to both of them?

How can she consistently blame Poe for the actions of a bombing fleet over which she has direct authority? The plan had apparently been approved by her from the start, yet she changed her mind at the last moment for no apparently reason, lost her entire fleet, and then for no apparent reason decided to blame the person who put himself in the most risk, all while only following the plan, for following through on his orders.

Even worse, we're told that the big ship has the capacity to destroy the rebels in a single shot. If that ship had not been destroyed, the entire chase sequence wouldn't have happened, because they'd all be dead. Poe has to know this, so he's trapped between a rock and a hard place; if he follows Leia's orders, everyone dies. If he doesn't, he's violating her orders.

Nothing in leia's process of command makes any sense. 

1. She failed to give her own fleet different orders. 

2. She gave orders that would result in her own immediate death.

3. She canceled a mission once the most dangerous part was already complete, and her own troops were still in danger, but before any benefit had been gained. 

4. And the entire thing was based on the First Order being so incompetent and immature that they could be distracted by a single guy in a single fighter saying mean things to them, and then dodge dozens of high-tech turrets long enough to single-handedly destroy all said turrets, despite said turrets being designed for the express purpose of dealing with exactly that sort of attacker.

3795,It's a shame that liking The Last Jedi has become such a taboo. :(,"With Rian Johnson's Twitter page still being attacked by haters demanding an apology, YouTube videos about how TLJ ruined Star Wars forever still being uploaded, extremely negative Metacritic ratings still piling up, and even May the 4th being used as a ""We hate TLJ"" day in some Star Wars circles, it's become clear that the hatred TLJ is nowhere near evaporating, and at this point it's frankly ridiculous.

I've seen TLJ three times now. Once in the cinema and twice on DVD. My third viewing was just a couple of days ago. I've also watched numerous videos about it - rants, analysis videos, critiques, behind-the-scenes videos. And I honestly love it. While I still think the casino part is really silly (although I think that was the point) and I still don't understand Admiral Holdo's character arc (does she even have one?), almost everything else in the film is great to me. It's just a really strong Star Wars film, warts and all.

And the film being such a taboo to like sucks because this film has some really good things about it. Like, for example, the whole ""everyone has darkness inside them"" thing. That's so true. We're all arrogant sometimes, we all make stupid mistakes that we severely regret, and we all have dark thoughts about ourselves and society as a whole. Another example is the overall theme of failure that runs throughout the film. A lot of people say that this ruined the sequel trilogy for them but again, I like this aspect because it shows the true nature of a galactic war, i.e. things can get seriously bad, fast and big heroic attempts can end in utter disaster. TFA was awesome but I think we can all agree that these new heroes instantly blowing up a planet-sized Death Star was a really over-the-top victory. This movie shows that a gargantuan early achievement like that doesn't always translate into certain victory in the end.

But alas, the film continues to get pounded with hatred, anger, rant videos, conspiracy videos, negative ratings, everything. It's so ridiculous, and it's not dying down as of now.",StarWars,1525606690,TT454,295,243,True,2018-05-06

3819,Ron Howard: ‘No Concrete Plans’ For Solo: A Star Wars Story Sequels,"One definite positive for the film came a couple weeks back when Alden Ehrenreich confirmed a three\-picture deal to play Han Solo. It was a surprising development considering that the *Star Wars*anthology films were originally designed to be one\-off films, a la* Rogue One: A Star Wars Stor*y, rather than film series of their own. Responding to the news about Ehrenreich’s deal, Howard implied in an interview with [*Fandango*](https://www.fandango.com/movie-news/exclusive-interview-solo-director-ron-howard-on-how-rush-and-bullitt-helped-inspire-the-newest-star-wars-movie-753179) that no other pictures were set in stone, and Disney and Lucasfilm were taking a wait and see approach once the film finally hits theaters. He says:

&gt;“I think the fans are going to define all of that. I mean I think that Lucasfilm and Disney in casting actors, and particularly younger actors, want to see what happens and build upon that. Certainly, they want the commitment from the young actors, but there are no concrete plans. I think there’s been a lot of creative energy and now marketing energy going behind this movie.”

She asks, ""Was the actress they modeled her off of American or British?""

""I... I have no idea.""

""Well it looks like the actress is saying 'hope' with a British accent and it doesn't match the American accent in the audio.""

Here are common traits of abandoned children.,"**I’ve been reading up more on abandonment and its impact on homelessness and also in employed adults. I noticed a shocking amount of similarities to Rey that help explain some of her actions.**

* An intense fear of abandonment that interferes in forming primary relationships in adulthood.

* Intrusive insecurity that interferes in your social life and goal achievement.

* Anxiety with authority figures.

* Tendency toward self defeating behavior patterns. 

* A tendency to repeatedly subject yourself to people or experiences that lead to another loss, another rejection, and another trauma.

* Intrusive reawakening of old losses; echoes of old feelings of vulnerability and fear which interfere in current experience.

* Flashbacks of traumatic separations and other events.

* Conversely, partial or complete memory blocks of childhood traumas.

* Low sense of worth; low sense of entitlement

* Feelings of emotional detachment around violence. 

* Conversely, difficulty letting go of the painful feelings of old rejections and losses.

* Difficulty letting go, even when we know the relationship cannot meet our basic needs

* Episodes of self-neglectful or self destructive behavior.

* Difficulty sleeping. 

* Increased propensity for addictions. 

* Extreme sensitivity to perceived rejections, exclusions or criticisms.

* Difficulty feeling the affection and other physical comforts offered by a willing partner. 

* Tendency to ‘get turned off’ and ‘lose the connection’ by involuntarily shutting down romantically and/or sexually on a willing partner.

* Conversely, tendency to feel hopelessly hooked on a partner who is emotionally distancing.

* A tendency to rush into relationships and clamp on too quickly.

* Difficulty letting go because you have attached with emotional epoxy, even when you know your partner is no longer able to fulfill your needs, or even when you know your partner is not good for you.

* A heightened sense of responsibility to others, rescuing, attending to people’s needs, even when they have not voiced them.

* Tendency to have unrealistic expectations and heightened reactivity toward others such that it creates conflict and burns bridges to your social connections.

* People-pleasing – excessive need for acceptance or approval.

* Self-judgment; unrealistic expectations toward yourself.

* Fear response to people’s anger, which unwittingly sets you up to being “controlled” by them.

* Co-dependency issues in which you give too much of yourself to others and feel you don’t get enough back.

* Tendency to act impulsively without being able to put the brakes on, even when you are aware of the negative consequences.

* Tendency toward unpredictable outbursts of anger.

* Conversely, tendency to under-react to anger out of fear of breaking the connection and also out of your extreme aversion to ‘not being liked’.",StarWars,1525652103,DH80,190,139,True,2018-05-06

3859,Anyone else kind of depressed about the state of Star Wars?,"Look, I'm trying real hard to be negative and with each release I try to temper my expectations but after 6 years of new Star Wars media, I'm rather disappointed in the general direction it's all gone.

For context, I always thought making an Episode 7 would be extraneous, but when I heard it was being made, I got really excited. However, Episode 7 and 8 in retrospect just don't hold up to me or feel compelling enough to warrant the dramatic decision to continue what was once a complete saga. And visually, I feel these movies lack their own aesthetic, while at the same time all their attempts to mimic the feel of Star Wars all fall flat. 

I'm all for adding new things into Star Wars but they need to feel purposeful and these decisions need to be made with diligence and I don't feel they have been. Not to mention the video game facet of Star Wars has been absolutely abysmal to add salt to the wound. 

If you like the new direction Star Wars is going, I really really envy you. And if there are kids out there that are as captivated by the series just as strongly as I was, then that's fantastic too.

My dad was a teenager who’s eyes were lit on fire with the first Star Wars but the prequels, man, he never even purchased on dvd. You can argue about how many Star Wars fans loved the prequels and maybe my world view is mistaken but I grew up in a Star Wars fanbase with few fans left standing up.

In other words: Solo: A Star Wars Story; followed by Chewbacca: A Star Wars Story; and finally Lando: A Star Wars Story. Han (and Chewy and Lando) would appear in all three, first Han would be the protagonist then as a supporting character in each of the other two. This way each character gets their day in the limelight as the ""star"", but the stories can be connected enough to still be a trilogy, like each movie features a ""job"" or heist that the three characters go on prior to A New Hope, while the backstory and character development moments would focus on Chewy in part 2, and Lando in part 3.

Yoda died because he was old. Yeah, he was also old one movie earlier, and could flip around and use the force - but now he's *older*, so he is going to just lay down and die. His ambiguous species' lifespan conveniently times out right at the point during the Hero's Journey in which Luke needs a mentor to die.

Darth Vader's cause of death was getting indirectly struck by Sith Lightning (which has never killed any character in any other movie but whatever) and throwing 80 lbs off a balcony. And that somehow affected his breathing apparatus, so he takes it off and dies.

Boba Fett was accidentally bumped by a blind man, setting off the jet-pack he had used for years, but now he somehow forgets how to use it, falls into a pit, and dies.

Padme had everything she'd ever fought for destroyed, including democracy, Anakin, and any hope that the emperor wouldn't hunt down and eventually kill her kids.

On top of that, could they be used as a weapon? It's an odd query, but we've seen at least one instance of what I assume are ray shields killing living beings in the Clone Wars series.

3933,[Movies] [General Discussion] The Prequel Trilogy is not bad.,"I finally rewatched the prequel trilogy after so many years, and I actually really liked the prequel movies. Something I've never really understood is why people ""claim"" that the prequels are bad, yet all they have to argue with is subjective preferences.

Put simply, its pretty difficult to find a ""flaw"" with the prequels that isn't subjective. Not to mention that it basically does everything the original trilogy did correctly but better, while also adding a lot of new things to the mix like galactic politics and a much more prevalent story (story is like, non-existent in the OT).

Even though all of them are good movies, this is how I'd rank them from best to worst:

1) The Phantom Menace

2) Revenge of the Sith

3) Attack of the Clones

To be honest, I'd say Attack of the Clones is the worst because the movie takes quite a while to get to the meat of its story. Other than that though, Episode 2 is a good movie.

The special effects and CGI aged really well though, not gonna lie. Its kind of surprising with how real it looks, even though these movies are well over a decade old.

And before the ""Star Wars The Clone Wars is way better"" comments, its unfair to compare a TV show to a movie series (especially since TCW takes place in between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, timeline-wise). Besides, The Clone Wars (Cartoon Network series) ""fixes"" issues that don't exist in the prequels. I love the TV show and movie, but I'm sick of hearing the ""Anakin is a bad character in the movies"" crap (among several other things).

If you can't find a large amount of objective problems with the prequel movies that can be proven with empirical facts/evidence, the prequel movies aren't bad.

I'd like to hear y'alls thoughts on this. From my point of view the prequels are better than the original trilogy. Whats your point of view, and do you agree or disagree with anything I've said?",StarWars,1525777353,boyishdude1234,41,0,True,2018-05-08
3934,[All Spoilers] Still trying to make sense of Ep8.,"So after 6 months and thanks to a DVD release I am still surprised by how much I'm troubled by LTJ so I wanted to float some head canon and see what people think.

I can't help but wonder that what we're seeing in Luke is what happens when a Jedi isn't trained properly. There is a common argument that asks why younglings had to be so young, Luke was 18 and he did fine and oh MaRey Sue... well sort of. All we really saw either character do was kick the bad guys ass and get a feel for the force, remember end of ROTJ Luke was only really considered to not be a padawan. Is what the story could be about for Rey is finding out that there is much more to being a Jedi than winning wars? The exact same thing Yoda cautioned when the clone wars begun and the exact same thing that Luke realised but couldn't really move past. Could Star Wars be a cautionary tale about the futility of war and how it can rob a society of a whole generation? A bit of a stretch but honestly after 6 months it's mt best shot at integrating it.

3935,no saber duel in last jedi,"ok so i dont want to beat a dead horse here.

last jedi is past now. even blu ray has been out for some time

but after seeing it for another time i realised how much of a ""tease"" it was . 

at the end when kylo ren faced ghost luke. there could have been an awesome saber duel. i know i know. he turned out to be a ghost. thts what i thot and made my peace with like most people. but i mean WTF . he actually gave han's golden dice and handed it to leia. even kissed her forehead and everything. but when facing kylo he was like a hologram.... physics did not work there?? going out of range or something???

fine make him a ghost. creative decision FINE!! .

but why not an awesome saber duel. and carry on tradition . give an awesome fan service which i am sure most of us were expecting. (rogue one did that with vader at the end)
and save the movie even if one tiny bit!! 

this movie is so daring at so many complex levels. irritatings things are found out even after 4-5th movie viewing.

this meme is a very good example for the same:

Make all the moons and planets free to explore, allow you to choose which species you want to be, choose to either be a pirate, cargo trader, etc. Then, have two game servers. Server 1 will be the clone wars and server 2 will be the rebellion.  Then from there you can either be a space fighter or work on being the pilot of the huge destroyer ships, or you can fight the battles on the ground. you can choose to be a clone, droid, rebel, or imperial soldier. make the game multiplayer or single player. you could fight, trade, explore, etc. You could even be a senate guard or be a politic in the senate.

3948,My thoughts on the Solo Movie,"I just seen this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8hvg3y/fordifide\_solo\_posters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8hvg3y/fordifide_solo_posters/) by [u/icon\_fess](https://www.reddit.com/user/icon_fess)

And have to confess, this is REALLY satisfying!

That being said, I feel bad for not having high expectation about this movie. I think it's interesting to see Solo's background but at what cost? 

Now, I know that what matters is the story and the character, not the actor \(as long as he does a good job\).  But the truth is that I'll never see him as Han, more like someone acting like him. And that, I think, hurts the movie itself. 

I would rather prefer have the Solo's book and Ahsoka's movie of Thraw's for exemple. Yes, I know, financially it's not even close to be the same thing but the truth is that it wouldn't hurt anyone and you can still enjoy the story. But neither Luscasfilm nor Disney were ever known for NOT thinking about profit first so....

The thing is, for me, this is not just about Alden, I have nothing against him. I really like Donald Glover and I can't see Lando in him either... Which make me realize that the only character I'll really enjoy in this movie will be Chewie \(oh and the Falcon\) and that's sad because I would like to watch the movie for what it is and not for what should be there.

I understand that they couldn't make the hole movie with cgi, that's just stupid in my opinion but either way, I'm going to watch a movie, not relaxed but always trying to picture something else in my head. Almost like watching a movie in a language you just learned and you still translate really slowly.

That's my opinion and it has nothing to do with the professionals that appear in the movie but with Disney decision. I was reticent about the sequel but then I understood that Star Wars was evolving and that I wouldn't see more Han and Luke or Anakin and Kenobi adventures and since than I'm able to enjoy the new movies and I was able to *let go of the past* and move forward. With the Solo movie I feel like I have to rewind this thought and I really don't want to do it because it was hard to get pass that. Like when you finish the game level you have being playing for the last week and when you finally get there, the damn thing crashes and you have to do it all over again.

So, unless I start looking at Star Wars as a broken universe that was really great but now I can't expect much from it \(and that's a path that would hurt me\) or I just think of this movie as a glitch in the system, at least until it comes out.",StarWars,1525792970,Function_Key,13,0,True,2018-05-08
3949,A thought on the logistics of the Clone Wars.,"A lot of people have questioned the usefulness of a clone army in comparison to a droid army, noting that the clone army wouldn't be very cost effective. I don't think this would actually be a major concern because the main issue in a galactic scale war would be lift capacity. It doesn't matter if the Confederates' droid army outnumbers the clones 100 to 1 if they can only deploy a small number of them to any given battlefield given their military transport capability. This would result in many situations where the clones would be locally superior. Large formations of droids could even be destroyed by artillery or orbital bombardment.

3951,Is it REALLY that hard to understand the state of the galaxy in TFA?,"I'll be the first to admit that it could have used a LITTLE more exposition, but I see some people acting like it's impossible to make heads or tails of it.

From the opening crawl alone, I felt like I had a decent grasp on what was going on.  There's an evil military dictatorship called the First Order that was formed from the Imperial Remnant.  They're hunting down Luke Skywalker.  Opposing them is a guerrilla force called the Resistance, which has support from the New Republic (clearly the government that the Rebel Alliance formed after RotJ).  Given that the Republic is not fighting them directly, one can assume that the galaxy is in some sort of state of fragile peace.  Got it.  Let's go.

And to go further, the ""home worlds"" of each faction tells us what we need to know about their relative power dynamics.  The New Republic's capital world is wealthy and urban.  They are clearly the big dogs.  The First Order's capital world is desolate and remote, yet industrial.  They clearly have some power.  And the Resistance's world is remote and hidden, so they are clearly in hiding.

Again, I'm not saying that the film couldn't have benefited from more exposition, but aren't people always complaining about filmmakers telling and not showing?  In my opinion, TFA gives us the basic background info in the opening crawl, and then expands on it by actually showing us what each of these factions ""looks like"" via their home worlds.

3952,Deciphering the Venator-class' specifications,"I'm starting on a 3d model of a modified *Venator*-class (more on that later) using [this image](http://i.imgur.com/WFNV7Ku.jpg) as a reference, but none of the shown views (top, side, front) correspond with each other (a) or with the measurements given (b).

A) The three views have dimensions of 2012x1008px (*top*), 2023x519px (*side*), and 981x528px (*front*), but these don't play nice with each other. Let's say you scale the side view down to match the top view—the new dimensions will be 2012x516px; scaling the front view to match will give it the new dimensions of 959x516 px, or 50 pixels narrower in span than indicated by the top view. This pattern persists regardless of which image you key the others to.

B) this is further corroborated if you use the ""official"" dimensions: the length:span ratio of the *Venator* is 1137:548, or 2.075, while the top view gives a ratio of 1.996. The span:height ratio for the *Venator* is 548:268, or 2.045; front view is 1.858. Length:height should be 1137:268, 4.243; 3.898 is shown.

She says that the Resistance will win by ""saving what we love"" rather than ""fighting what we hate."" Sounds kinda silly for a war, right? But this is exactly what Luke does. He doesn't destroy a single thing to save the Resistance, he doesn't leave a scratch on Ren or any piece of First Order equipment. His sacrifice is only aimed at protecting the things he loves. Like Holdo's jump and Finn's attempted kamikaze, Luke was willing to die for the Resistance. The difference is that Luke wasn't focused on destruction, just preservation.

3977,I like the idea that Snoke was simply a part of Palpatine's Contingency for the Empire.,"Given that he's ultimately not the main villain of this saga, I don't think he needs some deep or complex backstory.  Like the rest of the First Order, he can just be borne out of the Empire.  

As most people know, Palpatine had some strange looking [advisors](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/44/Inner_circle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130519182116).  Maybe Snoke can just be one of them (not necessarily one of them in the picture there, but one of them in terms of office).  He was Palpatine's advisor for the Unknown Regions (an area in which Palpatine was looking to expand the Empire).

He obviously had a lot of Force potential, but maybe Palpatine purposely left him untrained because he didn't want another challenger to the throne.  But when he died, he sent a [Sentinel](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sentinel_(Contingency)) to bestow Snoke with all of his dark side knowledge/wisdom/secrets.  From there, Snoke could easily ascend to the top of the Imperial chain of command and impose his will.  

That could also be why he instinctively thinks to recruit a Skywalker and make him his enforcer.  That's how Palpatine was able to rule for so long.  But, like Palpatine before him, Snoke didn't count on his apprentice's betrayal.

I'm not saying any of this is canon.  There may be some stuff in the actual canon that contradicts it.  But luckily for me, I only care about the films (unless there's something cool in actual canon that I want to implement into my own headcanon).

3993,"Seeing TFA with my Dad (62) is one of my favorite memories, and now we see all the new movies together.","The sequels have been the first Star Wars movies I’ve really gotten to fully experience with my Dad. He’s a pretty huge Star Wars fan and started us on the VHS tapes of the OT pretty early. 

My first movie in theaters was the re-release of ROTJ and I was just stuck to the screen the entire time - but it was something my dad had seen before (and technically I had too, just not in theaters). 

They took me to TPM and he wasn’t really big on it, I saw the next two prequels with friends. 

Fast forward to TFA, and I took my Dad the weekend after opening night. 

My favorite memory of watching Star Wars with my dad is looking over to see his reactions throughout the movie, specifically when Rey pulls the saber from the snow near the end of TFA. He smiled real big and made a “yes! / fuck yea!” fist gesture and was nodding during that part. 

On the entire way home, he kept talking about his favorite parts (Rey’s introduction, the saber battle, the falcon, etc) and it was the first time I remember him actually talking about theories and anything like that for what might happen next. When we eventually got the blu ray, he wanted to watch Rey’s vision in slow mo like 10 times lol. He’s 62 for context..

With TLJ, he had similar reactions to the throne room scene and when it was revealed that Luke was meditating on the island. He also loved Yoda and the “samurai stand offs” between Luke and Kylo. The end with the kids telling stories of Luke and the toy made him cry, along with the Yoda scene and Luke with the twin suns. 

Anyway, the sequels may not be perfect but I’m glad that I can enjoy them with my Dad and that it’s given us something new to look forward to watching together. We have watched the OT together many, many times - but it’s cool to have something that we can both see for the first time rather than him showing it to me years after he’s seen it.

3994,Did Darth Sidious know about Snoke ?,"Snoke still remains a very mysterious figure. We know that he has been around for a long time, he was possibly hundreds of years old. He himself claimed that he was there before the Empire, that he watched the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.

And Darth Sidious had an enormously great amount of knowledge of nearly everything that happened in the galaxy. In order for his grand plan to work he had to know all the factors and variables. There is no way that the Sith (who had spent a millenium amassing a sheer endless amount of connections, knowledge, resources and political influence) did not know about a Dark Side Force user like Snoke.

So why did Sidious never go after Snoke and try to eliminate that possible and extremely potent competition for galaxy domination ? He went after Talzin for the same reason and had her killed. If the Sith fear anything it is the loss of their power and they are obsessed with the philosophy that only the most powerful should rule. They suffer no rivals. Yet they never went after Snoke. There is not even any indication that Vader ever knew of Snokes existence, meaning that Sidious probably kept this from him. The Jedi also did not seem to be aware of Snokes existence as there is no mention anywhere of him in any Jedi history.

One possible explanation is that Snoke has hidden in the Unknown Regions for far longer then previously assumed. We know he was the one who reformed the remnants of the Empire that fled into the Unknown regions into the First Order and it is no secret that Snoke seemed to be obsessed with the Empires iconography and designs. Could it be that Snoke hid in these Regions decades before the Empire fell ?

And here is where it gets really interesting: 

Several novels have in fact revealed that Darth Sidious had an enormous interest in the Unknown Regions. In fact he treated Thrawn so favorably because Thrawn hailed from these Regions and greatly helped Sidious mapping them out. It was because of Thrawns work that the remnants of the Empire were able to safely retreat into those Regions after the Battle of Jakku.

And there is more. Sidious said that there was a great power of the dark side in those Regions. A power that he believed to be even the source of his own power and one that he was very anxious to discover. Could this power that Sidious sensed in those Regions have been Snoke ? 

And here is a wild theory for you: Could it be that Sidious found Snoke and nearly destroyed him, resulting in the injuries that Snoke suffered ? Maybe Sidious believed Snoke to be destroyed and returned to the imperial galaxy while Snoke slowly recovered and became obsessed with Sidious designs and the idea of a better and improved Empire, resulting in his formation of the First Order.

Despite Snokes death, there are still quite a lot of questions surrounding him in the larger context of the saga.",StarWars,1522978108,Kazuya_Kazama,27,5,True,2018-04-05

4004,"The Last Jedi ended with no real hook for Episode IX, and I think that's a problem.","So when TLJ ended, there was no horrible truth Rey learned about her past that she needed to deal with. Characters didn't get captured. Rey didn't get her ass kicked and had to find a way to beat the bad guy. There's no great mystery the hero needs to solve to save the day. No crazy twist ending. Nothing. As many people have pointed out, TLJ felt like the conclusion, instead of the middle part of a story.

This is partly why I think there will be overall less interest in Episode IX when it releases. People have mentioned the middle Star Wars movies always make the least amount of money, but I think there are a number of circumstance contributing to that, and one of them is because both RotJ and RotS had a big hook. 

In Return of the Jedi the heroes needed to go save Han Solo, and Luke needed to deal with the fact that Vader was his father and confront him. In Revenge of the Sith, the hook was that we were going to see Anakin's final transition into Darth Vader, and how the Republic fell and the Empire rose. But what exactly is the hook for Episode IX?

I know some of you who loved TLJ can come up with reasons why you're excited for Episode IX, but I'm talking about the average person here, who isn't as invested as you are, or who didn't like the movie. Does the hook for Episode IX (if there is one), honestly compare to the ones RotJ and RotS had? 

People were ecstatic for TFA because we were finally getting new Star Wars after 10 years, we were gonna see the return of the OT characters, and it was being done by better filmmakers. People were hyped for TLJ, because of all the mystery boxes TFA left us with, and because we were finally going to see Luke Skywalker again.

But Episode IX? Han is dead, Luke is dead (will probably cameo) and Carrie Fisher tragically passed away. So the appeal of the OT characters is gone for the most part. TLJ did away with the big mysteries. Really the best thing it has going for it is the relationship between Rey and Kylo. But this is just my two cents here, but overall I think almost wiping the slate clean and ending TLJ with no hook for Episode IX was a mistake. ",StarWars,1522985431,ScionN7,36,13,True,2018-04-05
4005,How Can We Bridge The Gap?,"The Star Wars fandom is amazing. We are dedicated, loyal, and span generations. But we have our own flaws, just like everyone else. 

The one thing that has always bothered me about the fandom is the contention. We all like Star Wars (in different ways, yes) and yet we always argue. Way too much! Which Star Wars are good? Which are bad? These are entirely subjective questions, but because the answers are so important to us, we are upset when others disagree. It is understandable. I hate explaining to someone from the OT generation why I like the prequels, they look at me like I'm crazy! And it isn't fair that someone who says they like the OT the best gets down voted by legions of r/prequelmemers. It is natural to like some more than others, but do we always need to be so aggressive about it?
When someone makes a statement about a Star Wars film that I feel is absurd, whether praising a ""bad"" one or criticizing a ""good"" one, the natural tendency is to tell them they're wrong. But I've been working my best to try to understand that they are all just opinions, and that it's fine that someone has one contrary to mine.

Do not misunderstand me. I'm not saying go out there and try to like your least favorite Star Wars, nor am I asking you to not voice your grievances when something doesn't go the way you hoped. I just believe that we, as a collective fandom, should remember that we are really all on the same side - Star Wars' side. 

So what do you think? Can we all try in little ways to bridge the gap a little bit? To respect each other? To strengthen the fandom from the inside-out? I think we can. And when we do, Star Wars will be stronger, too.",StarWars,1522987084,MesaIsTheSenate,22,13,True,2018-04-05

4012,The idea and potential of Solo: a Star Wars Story,"While watching A New Hope again, I can't help but pay Han more attention because of his Solo (pun intended) movie coming out this year.

I've always found Han to be very interesting particularly in ANH, ESB, and even TFA, he's proven to be more than a mere side character.

I'd like to start by saying that in my eyes, Han has a redemption arc in ANH. He starts out as a stone cold smuggler who cares about nobody but himself.

He refused to negotiate with Greedo and simply killed him on the spot (Han shot only in the original cut). He made it very clear from the start that he was only in it for the money.

Han later saw potential in Luke and wanted him to join him. Obviously he refused trying to recruit Han to his own cause but he wanted nothing to do with it. He believed the Death Star assault to be a suicide mission.

During his talk with Luke in the hangar bay, you could tell there was conflict within him. Han actually cared about these people.

In the end, if it weren't for Han intercepting Vader and his squadron, Luke would have been killed and the Rebel Alliance would have been annihilated by the Death Star.

Intentional or not, Han set the stage for Vader's redemption. If looked at correctly, Han mimics how Vader was portrayed throughout the entire trilogy.

The reason I'm bringing this up is because it gives me suspicions about Han as a character, I found myself wanting to know what happened to him that made him so cold. Why didn't he just help his friends in the first place?

This might be reaching a bit, but what if Solo has a double meaning. This could very well be a tragic story.

To me, Han Solo is like a forgotten version of Anakin Skywalker. He may not have any special powers or a laser sword but he's definitely got a story to tell.

Plus, I've seen reports in old news indicating that Geroge Lucas himself believed Han had a story worth telling before he sold the franchise to Disney.

I'm one of the few that really believe Solo has a lot of potential and if done right, could be an amazing film and I'm genuinely excited for it.",StarWars,1522997060,TimberWolfII,1,7,True,2018-04-06
4013,The only Kylo redemption arc I want,"I'm firmly in camp ""the villain is getting redeemed,"" but because I'm a Star Wars fan and impossibly picky, I want his redemption to occur in a specific way. 

The reason entire reason emo Ben transformed into evil Kylo is because he felt rejected and betrayed by everyone in his life. Now he is compensating by assuming this persona, demanding respect and fear even when he hasn't earned it (ala Theon in S2 GOT). He doesn't even seem to want to rule the galaxy as much as he wants people to take him seriously.  

If he's redeemed, I want this to involve him anonymously saving the Resistance in a way that earns him no glory. I don't even want him to necessarily be saving Rey in the process, because he already respects her (or cares for her, depending on your TLJ interpretation). I think only by showing a willingness to sacrifice himself for people who hate him (and whom he's been perfectly willing to kill up until that point) will he be able to complete reject his Kylo persona.

Kylo sets himself up as the next emperor and models the First Orders government after the Galactic Empire that Vader built. 

With the movie end drawing near you will see Kylo sitting behind his desk. He is surround by his guards in their crimson uniforms. All of a sudden the guards are lifted violently from the ground. Grapping at their throats, unable to inhale. With a loud crack all fall to the ground, dead. Kylo has already jumped onto his desk, blade in hand. The door to his office blast open with a grinding, screeching noise of metal against metal. Stepping through the smoke and battered remains of the door, a hooded figure appears. A blood red Light Saber in the hand of this unknown assailant. Kylo brings his weapon up to a defensive stance. Fear clearly planted on his face. The hooded figure turns toward Kylo and the audience. A familiar duck bill like face with two yellow, stalk eyes are visible under the hood. Kylo yells in fear, “What do you want.” The hooded figure calmly replies, “you’sa gonna die.” A smile appears across the orangey duckbill face.

This would make it foolish to track hyperspace movement because you could have a rock strapped to a hyperdrive (or like, an X-wing) blast you in half, while also not changing normal space combat as normal ships are not vulnerable to this.

So TLJ....

I didn’t like that there were no awesome light saber battles. The throne room fight was ok but underwhelming (yes the red screen was cool but it’s not enough)

The way Snoke died was stupid. He is made out to be super amazing with the force, he can get into peoples brains and manipulate them - make them see things and he set up those Skype talks between two people across the galaxy - but then he can’t see or feel that Kylo is thinking to kill him and he can’t see the light saber turning next to him. This is so bizarre and stupid I can’t even 

Leia unfreezing herself and flying through space was genuinely embarrassing to watch. Just awkward and cringe.

Rose was lame. Felt like a PC casting choice like Independence Day 2

Adding time specific political issues into the movie was weak (Canto scenes)

The conflict felt TINY. In the PT and OT the conflict feels huge, but for some reason RJ wasn’t able/didn’t bother to address them. It literally just feels like a tiny conflict with little side effects

The scenes with Rey on the Island where she falls down the hole and has all those mirrors... what was the point? It was so artsy and pointless and boring. Who cares who are parents are? Again I’m left confused - is this actually a Star Wars film? 

Kylo is a terrible main villain. He isn’t evil at all. He’s doubtful and whiney. 

The Porgs were just a weird add on for toys - fine - but no effort by RJ to make them even a tiny bit relevant 

Why make Luke an asshole? Why is Luke trying to kill his nephew on the basis of a few dark thoughts? He turned his father from the dark side who was so far gone... but Kylo was too hard? Again it makes no sense - where is the effort from RJ?

The comedy was shoe horned in and way too weak. That opening scene? Awful. It’s a long gag about the difficulties of international call centres. Ugh why?

The way Luke died... he died doing a projection? Why not just have him go to Crait and be a badass? Such an underwhelming death. 

Holdo with the purple hair... fine... what’s with the dumb idea about not telling the guy who just saved the day and the resistance (twice in two weeks) about their plan? There’s like 30 of them and the current plan is we’re all going to die. I mean.... what the fuck? 

The main plot is that two ships are slowly chasing each other while one runs out of fuel. Let that sink in guys. THAT is the plot. Er??? 

Overall I thought this was pretty dam bad. I didn’t think it was possible for a SW film to have so many issues but this was just a huge disappointment. 

Nothing against SW. like I said I love SW but this? Nah. 

I honestly don’t understand how any SW fan can say this is a good SW movie. Yeah it looked pretty and sounded nice, this is a known given considering the money involved, but liking the actual content? I don’t understand. 

The fact that RJ has the next trilogy, based on a TV episode and one ok movie, is kinda soul destroying. 

Sorry for the negativity. Peace.

4039,As a community we shouldn’t feel the need to preface our discussions of the Star Wars with things like “hate it or love it”,"This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot since The Last Jedi came out and received mixed reviews among fans. I’ve been a huge prequels fan ever since I saw them in theaters. In fact they are what reignited my love for Star Wars. And a lot of what we love about Star Wars comes from them. Yes they have their flaws, but I have become so sick of having to address that when I talk about the prequels. So many people I talk with just assume the prequels are trash and no one likes them and it’s just become some big meme now or something. And I get it, most people understood the prequels had a similar backlash amongst movie goers. But even in our own community do we need to really address the hate in order to talk about a Star Wars movie we enjoy?

If a post is criticizing aspects of a movie, then sure. But if we want to discuss a character we shouldn't need to essentially say, 'I get it people don't like this.' If people start criticizing the movie itself not in the appropriate post, then that can be downvoted. 

So basically, TLJ fans, I get it. I know what it’s like. I’m a huge prequels fan. The haters are out there. But I feel our community could rise above that and just love Star Wars and save the criticism for the relevant posts.

However, even as a fan I really emphasize with critics of the film on the topics of Luke and wanting Snoke to be explored more. 

However, even TLJ felt somewhat of a retread of previous films. Crait definitely echoes the battle of Hoth in ways and the battle in Snoke’s chamber feels similar the RoTJ’s battle between Luke and Darth. 

I feel like Rian saying “kill it if you have to,” was almost him speaking through the film more than anything. By killing Snoke, Rian forces the new trilogy off similar tracks than the original trilogy. The new trilogy is forced to end somewhere new. Rian knew the torch would be passed, and I believe he looked at it as his chance to also force events in the future. 

This may have contributed to his decisions with Luke as well, but we’ll see what J.J. does with Luke as a force ghost. 

Snoke was this trilogy’s obvious Emperor Palpatine, by killing him, Rian has changed the common story path. We focus in on Kylo as our true villain. Not a caricature, but instead a layered, conflicted villain. Should make for an emotional finale.  ",StarWars,1523027283,NickMoore30,155,168,True,2018-04-06

&gt;  “It doesn’t appeal to me, but I don’t think Rogue really is a Star Wars movie in many ways,” he added. “To me, it’s a Battle of Britain movie.”

Tony Gilroy made *Rogue One* a better movie without caring about Star Wars. By contrast, Rian Johnson demonstrably *loves* Star Wars, but some people hated his ideas anyway.

4047,"I'm coming around to the idea of Kylo Ren being ""redeemed.""","I'm thinking about things from his point of view.  I can understand why he feels betrayed by his supposed loved ones.  Han and Leia probably didn't spend as much time with him as they needed to.  Leia was trying to build the New Republic while Han was off thrill-seeking.  And when they started to notice the darkness rising within Ben, they passed him off to Luke so he could ""fix"" him... only for Luke ""threaten"" him on that fateful night at the training temple.

So I get it.  But at the same time, this doesn't ""excuse"" his crimes.  He's still willingly choosing to be evil at this point in his life.  

What I don't want to see is him doing a complete 180 in IX.  And it seems like that is what a lot of people want.  They want him to just randomly decide to start acting like a hero.  But that's not him.  That's not who this character is, and that's not what he cares about.

Instead, I'd prefer Ben to see his attachment to the dark side as an addiction.  Something he needs help overcoming.  If Rey and the new Jedi take him in so they can help cure him, then I'm cool with that.  It's restorative justice.  

But I'm not cool with him just riding off into the sunset as a hero and pretending like he hasn't done anything wrong.

Additionally, the planet itself looked too “earthy” apart from some aspects. The casino looked way too much like a normal earth casino.

4055,"Here's a quick short story I've been working on for the past year. It comes together in the end, I promise!","
 --a story of a boy--


**In Plain Sight**

  
To hide assured guilt, but what else could he do? He imagined his father’s car stalking up the driveway, hurling a deep, black smoke from its maw, snarling, and then snatching and consuming the boy whole. He knew his father wouldn’t be home for hours—or maybe it was days—it’s impossible to measure time precisely as a terrified boy who’d just done something wrong.
 

The thing would jewel like an obsidian gargoyle, large and looming, always in view no matter where he was. The way it submerged the living room in menacing blue and made his father howl with laughter every night—it must have been something powerfully charming. And now the boy had quelled it; with its sharp guts mingled into the carpet, its dark, glossy spine broken into pieces, scattered about the kitchen linoleum.


The boy couldn’t help but feel betrayed. He revered his scarlet hero with zeal—often donning his webbed emblem on whatever piece of clothing it could fit on. When the boy played in the woods behind his house, he’d often dig under rotting trees or in the shadowed banks of a muddy creek to find them, hoping one of the spiders would transform him, too. It never happened, of course. The boy had to settle for plastic toys that shot plastic baubles from his wrists; a facsimile of heroism. If only he had known the true power these spring-loaded toys possessed. If only the boy had known how easy it was to vanquish something without even trying, without purpose. Maybe he was a superhero after all? Perhaps the villain? 


The time between, the waiting, was the worst part. The boy’d periodically slither out of his closet from under a shield of dirty clothes, peak his head into the room, confirm what had happened, happened. Maybe it would magically congeal back to its proper form. Or maybe it was just tricking him, playing him for a fool. But the gargoyle stayed dead. It stayed broken and miserable, just like the boy. Enduring these conspiracies made his eyes heavy. 


Oh no! The boy had fallen asleep; betrayed again! This time by the warmth of his closet, perhaps by the weight of his guilt. How much time had passed? What day was it? He did not hear the mechanical beast churn into the driveway, nor his father’s belabored heels on the pavement, nor the clamoring of his keys unlocking the front door. Only the loud curse that uttered down the hallway. 


This was it. The axe had been drawn. In equal parts, the boy felt relief and dread. Like a fawn accepting the bite of a hungry predator upon its belly. It was time for his atonement, his judgement. The boy shambled towards the gallows, towards his father who stood motionless over the corpse of the obsidian beast. No sense in hiding anymore, he thought. Where else could he go? 


“What did you do?” the father said, his tone rigid as his body.
	

The boy did not reply, only stared at the back of his father’s head. In his imagination, his father’s face twisted and contorted in such fury it become unrecognizable, monstrous. 
	

“What did I tell you about this inside the house”, his father said as he kicked the debris of the television away, grabbing the plastic web-shooter that lay where the carpet met the kitchen. His father’s back was a mile-high stone wall, ancient and stalwart. 
	

He sighed, and without turning around, pointed at the boy’s room and said, “Go. Now.”
	


The boy heard words he was told never to repeat under the breath of his father as he went back into his room. He stayed there for what seemed like a lifetime, though only an hour passed. The boy sheepishly answered the door after hearing his father knock.
	

“Come on. Get your coat. We’re going out back”, his father said, flat and cold and with finality. 
	

A fair place as any, the boy thought. Open air, clear skies. Cool grass and trees that swayed in song. It was a fine place to end, anyway. The boy walked with his father into the backyard with a sense of acceptance, maybe even peace. He had lived a good life, a full life. Some boys don’t even make it as far as he had. He knew enough to appreciate that.
	

As they walked through the manicured grass and into the brush of woods, the boy felt cool wind on his face, saw light cut and daggered by dancing leaves. His father led them to a small running creek some minutes away, where a smaller clearing staged a black saucer, old and rusted. 
Grilled and fed to the wild, eh? Intimidating, certainly, but probably deserved. 
	

He motioned for the boy to sit next to him on a beached log. It smelled like moss and rain and felt soft to the touch. The boy’s head did not lift from his chest until his father spoke. 
	

His father gazed beyond the pepper trees and quietly admitted, “Your mom and I met at a signing. You know what that is?” The boy shook his head. “It’s when you get to meet them in person—they autograph things you give ‘em”. 
	

The boy’s father slid from his pocket a hooded figurine that clutched a blue blade. He flipped it over and on the leg was a scribbled name—the boy couldn’t understand the curved letters. 
	

“I was sixteen when we first met. You know that? A couple years later we had you”. The boy couldn’t help but flash a pale smile at the thought of her. “Your mother and I would dress-up all the time. The clothes, the toys—it’s the first thing that brought us together”.
	

The boy hadn’t noticed the duffel bag his father brought with him, but now watched as he plucked a few articles of clothing from it. His father handed the boy a brown robe and a plastic colored tube, told him to go ahead, put it on. His father told him to stand up, to let him see the boy. The boy did, and as he turned back around, he saw his father’s warm smile and mild eyes. 


The boy did not understand.
	

“Your mom would have loved this”, he said, still smiling. He patted the boy down, creased the robe where it needed to be creased, then flipped the hood of the robe over the boy’s head. The father chuckled when the hood consumed the boy’s face entirely. He gave the boy a plastic sword as he slid on a robe for himself. 
	

“Cheese or no cheese?” the boy’s father asked. He pulled from the duffel bag a plastic wrapped block of ground meat and yellow cheese, then a half-eaten bag of charcoal and a finger dusted bottle of lighter fluid. The boy paused, then pointed at the cheese, still unsure of his fate. His father nodded.
	

Even as it began to cloud over and drizzle, the two remained in their little hamlet for hours. The father taught the boy how to grill a hamburger, when to flip the patty as the juice began to seep through the gray. They even battled each other through the woods, clashing their plastic swords, pretending to lift each other in the air with their minds. When they ate, the boy saw his father drink that stuff he always drank. He asked if he could try it. 
	

“Your mother would kill me”, he said. He gave the boy the bottle. The boy sipped it cautiously—such a strange smell. The boy winced as he swallowed, shook his head. His father smirked, took the bottle back. “Not good, eh?” The boy shrugged, still wincing. He pulled the boy into his chest, laughed, and mulled his hair. 
He said after a beat as they ate, “She loved you very much. You know that, right?” 


The boy nodded sheepishly. 
	

When night came, the father and son reclined on the log by the grill and drew shapes with the stars. The father narrated a story about a family from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. The only light present was the blue glow of the plastic swords, the stars, and the only warmth, each other. The boy asked many questions about the story, about the family. The father answered every single one.

4057,A big issue I have with the sequel trilogy timescale so far,"Both the OT and the PT took place over about 5 years, and 20 years, respectively. I like this scale and the time skips, it makes things feel bigger and more epic in general. 

Now I’m gonna be real generous with time here for the ST:

VII:
 
Movie starts —&gt; poe wakes up: maybe 12 hours tops? Maybe he got a good nights sleep

Finn rescues Poe: his armors clean, so maybe another night. Plus we had the whole Rey montage. Let’s call it 12 hours

Finn wakes up on jakku: people don’t stay unconscious for longer than like 2 minutes but it’s the movies. Let’s say 2 hours 

Finn travels to Nima outpost: still daytime, so let’s say 8 hours. 

From Rey/Finn stealing the falcon to Rey bring taken on takodana, everything moves pretty fast and most scenes are connected so know big skips. Let’s say another 8 hours

They pretty much immediately go to dqar and make a plan and see it through. From here to the end of the movie, I’m calling it 54 hours 

VII:

Starts right after VII. From the beginning to the time they say “18 hours of fuel left” its maybe 6 hours. That makes it easier because that brings us to almost the end of the movie. From then on, let’s say another six. 
 
So where at this point in the PT or OT we had a stretch of 10 years or 3 years, we have 88 hours. Not a huge fan of this. Thoughts?",StarWars,1523034457,DrimboTangus,36,13,True,2018-04-06

- Luke is on an island (Ach-To) at the site of an ancient Jedi Temple

This isnt about defending or attacking the writing choices of TLJ, though I will if I have to cuz it rocks, and frankly I think Daisy Ridley brought us the best female character in a sci fi movie since Ellen Ripley told a bitch to get away from her. 

After just watching TLJ and TFA again, Daisy Ridley really does just add so much to every scene shes in. A couple of really great Rey moments:

The battle in the woods, when Kylo tells her shes using the force. Beforehand in the fight she seemed slightly scared and defensive; but then Daisy Ridley closes her eyes, opens them, and gets a kickass-angry look before going to town on poor Ben. And shes trained for years with her staff, so for me at least the fight was believable enough. But the really kicker is Ben is right in TLJ: she gets the same look on her face when they talk through the force link.

I cant think of any character who hasnt benefited from getting screentime with Rey. Ridley is so charismatic, from her relationships with Finn and Han, to her very brief but moving scenes with Leia and Poe, (""Im Poe."" ""Im Rey!"" ""I know"") and her banter with Kylo in TLJ, where we see her go from mortal hatred to understanding over her time on the island, and both of them verbally sparring is even better than their physical fight.

Her relationship with Luke deserves mention. She really is the perfect foil to the curmudgeonly Luke we find in TLJ. She is sincere and hopeful, like he used to be, enough to drive away much of his newfound cynicism, and he is clever enough to be able to prank her from time to time. Their master/student relationship is fantastic, I could really watch a whole movie of them training on Ach Toe.

When Luke asks her why shes come to find him in TLJ, her answer and delivery is moving and really defines where shes going: Theres something inside her, she doesnt know what it is, and shes scared by it. When Anakin or Luke discover force powers they are all ""Cool Im the chosen one! Lets go kill some Sith!"" She doesnt want to be a hero, she just wants guidance and help.

All her little scenes, when shes playing with the rain on Ach Toe or seeing forests for the first time, or her reaction to seeing the Rathtar for the first time. She really captures the naivety and charm of Luke in the originals without ever coming across as whiny, which is a seriously tough thing to do.

""Do you have a cowl or something?""

I know Im forgetting things. What else is worth appreciating about our last jedi?

4070,Something that I really like about TLJ,"So 5 months ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/75igyf/one_thing_i_hope_to_see_in_the_last_two_movies_of/) about my hopes for lightsaber combat in the future of the trilogy, and I have to say, TLJ was definitely a very good example of this. 

To summarize, I posted about how I wanted the lightsaber fights to look different than the prequels even if our film-making technology had advanced since their production. This is because all the characters that we know of that were trained in classical lightsaber combat and were relevant (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, the Emperor, and Yoda) are dead. Luke did receive some training, but not a lot. In Legends, Luke created the three new forms of lightsaber combat from holocrons that he found of the classical seven. He combined elements from certain styles and came up with three new ones. But even then, Luke had to figure out lightsaber combat on his own. It's very evident that he was a poor duelist throughout the original trilogy, at least from the perspective of someone who is classically trained.

Classical lightsaber combat is gone, and it is only survived through someone who was not actually properly trained.

This leads me to my main point. Intentional or not, it's quite obvious that the choreography, at least to me, reflects that the old ways of combat are gone. Kylo Ren and Rey both fight in a certain way (because they're both terrible at lightsaber combat), but also because their individual styles are more reminiscent of the styles that Luke created, which combined the classical styles. 

It seems quite obvious that the choreography is matching the evolution in lightsaber combat (or really, devolution) along with the individual strengths and weaknesses of each character, and as someone who is really into lightsaber combat, I love it!

4073,Thoughts on Rebels (pretty late..),"So I’m pretty late on this one. I’m a huge fan of Star Wars in general, but I just never got around to watching the TV shows. I can recite the films word-for-word (literally), but yeah, I decided it was time I watched them.

I binged The Clone Wars, and it was *phenomenal*. I am so sad they cancelled it, and I understand what everyone means when they talk about how great it was.

Then came time to watch Rebels. I wasn’t too excited for this, and thought it might just be a “I’ll watch it because I need to”. That was the case for the most part, but there was an exception..

I knew what happened. I just finished S2, although I knew months and months ago how it ended and I know how S3 and the finale ends. But I was crying, and I really didn’t think it would happen.

The Ahsoka VS Vader part killed me. After watching The Clone Wars and then seeing her face him, good Lord, I was a mess.

At this point I feel that if we keep giving disney our money,they will pull a michael bay who basically said "" no matter how much people hate them they will still continue to go see them in theaters.""

I love star wars and grew up with the original trilogy.  The best way to fix the current problem is to boycot star wars all together until disney gets their act together and make a good star wars movie.

I think james cameron said it best "" in order for a sequel to be good,it must do something new, and pay tribute to the movies before it.""

Here are some of the things that made the original trilogy so great that are not being done in the new movies(for the most part).

1) introduce new alien species that are memorable.

2)introduce new military technology

3)interesting characters, character drama and character growth

4)have cool villains

5)have the heroes go on an adventure/quest that takes  a lot of time to complete( TLJ took place in the time spam of a day)

6)Build up the main hero,making them weak at first,and slowly build them up to a force to be reckoned with ( in both films Rey is a merry sue).

4092,I think I hate the nucanon,"To be clear, I love the sequel trilogy thus far. I think it's been a lot of fun with fresh new ideas and I'm really looking forward to what Episode IX has to offer. That said, I hate everything else that's been put out. 

From the comics I've read, they're just awful. Yes, even Vader Down. There's a few standouts, like the Lando series, but overall they're really bad. Especially the Anakin and Obi Wan series where they go to a steampunk planet. Man, that was terrible. Recently they just brought back Jaxxon the green rabbit into canon which is just dumb. Yes, Jaxxon's a funny character like Mount Sorrows, but he's funny because he's such a dumb character to create. 

I can't comment on the novels because I haven't read any of them all the way through, and that goes for the old EU as well. I did read parts of Lost Stars and Lords of the Sith but I just didn't see the appeal so I didn't stick with them. However, same can be said for the Thrawn Trilogy (I mean, hot chocolate???) so maybe Star Wars books aren't for me. 

I know I'm going to get a thousand downvotes for this (and I know this isn't technically ""nucanon"" because it was made before the wipe, but it is still canon) but I don't like The Clone Wars. It has some great storylines and ideas throughout, but Ahsoka never grew on me and, as cool as his story was, I hated that they brought back Darth Maul. Both of these problems continued into Rebels and the fact Ahsoka and Ezra are both still alive during the entire OT drives me insane and definitely contradicts Yoda's line ""when gone am I, the last of the Jedi you will be."" And yes, I know Ahsoka is not a Jedi, but she was trained as one and so was Ezra. It definitely does not align with what was established 35 years ago. 

Also going to get hate for this, but Rogue One was a boring, meaningless movie. No emotion, no characters, no new ideas. It doesn't fix the ""plot hole"" (it's not a plot hole) in Star Wars, it only says Galen Erso tampered with the reactor to make it explode which contradicts what's seen in TPM and in ROTJ. Everyone says the third act is great, and I thought so too the first time, but after seeing it a second time I realized how pointless the entire thing is. What's the objective of the Rebel Fleet at Scariff? Why did the Rebel ""spies"" decide to blow everything up instead of just sneak around? And that Vader scene at the end was so contradictory to Vader's menacing presence in the OT. Not to mention how tone deaf it was.

4098,Whats the point of the Disney Trilogy ?,"In the grand scheme of the history of that galaxy, the PT covered the fall of the thousand year old Republic and Jedi order centering around a once in several generations Force sensitive user (a monumental event) and the OT covered the resurrection of the Republic and the return of the Jedi (another monumental event). 

I get the feeling that this new Disney trilogy has no clear purpose. At best its telling the events of a footnote in that galaxy's history. 

None of it is clear. The new Republic seems to have been pretty weak to be taken out so easily by the First Order, and if Admiral Holdo's leadership is an indication, I'm not surprised. If the First Order has so many resources and such a strong standing army with new recruits, why didn't they just retain the name ""Empire""? 

Even the Jedi angle seems like a weird drawn out extension of the OT. Luke was the last Jedi setting out to restore the order........so now he's gone and its up to Rey......but why? It doesn't seem to be adding any new wrinkle. 

What is Kylo's purpose? Whats his endgame? Palpatine wanted power, Anakin wanted control.........Kylo just seems to hate all things, the Sith included (""let it all die""), but why? Where is that coming from? 

I really just don't understand the point of any of this. There doesn't seem to be a story worth telling. I get the strong feeling telling a good worthwhile story was the last thing Disney had on its to do list when making this trilogy.

Also in episode VI, why didn't they cover up the hole to protect the heart of the death star?

4112,Who remembers when being a Star Wars fan wasn't cool?,"Movie theatres to a seven year old rural farm kid in 1977 were a magical destination that transported you far, far away. I only got to see maybe one or two movies a year, and luckily, mom made my older brother and his friends drag me along to the one that literally changed my life.

All the indian burns, noogies, and wet willy's I endured on the ride into town were totally worth it, because any kid that was older and bigger than you let you know it back then. I was just happy getting to see some 'outer space' movie.

When the thunderous music kicked in and yellow letters started crawling up the screen, one of the boys told me, ""Don't try to read it, it's going by too fast for little kids."" 

I gave it a shot but he was mostly right. The towering message seemed to go on forever and I was getting bored. I wanted to see a movie, not practice reading while fighting over handfuls of popcorn from the community bucket.

Then the shot panned down and I felt like I was falling. I fell into Star Wars. You know the rest. 

For years after, every stick I held was a lightsaber or a blaster. Every tree and hayloft I climbed around was on the Death Star. The setting sun turned my cornfields into Tatooine. I flew my left hand around pretending it was the Falcon, even though I was right-handed. I was Luke Skywalker. I was Vader. I was everything. It changed my world.


I lived like this day after day. No new information. No blogs. No books. No websites, opinions, or speculation. Fueled by one movie I saw only once. My imagination ran wild wearing out the few action figures, X-wing, or TIE fighter I received for a birthday, a Christmas. My collection was meager but well loved.

In those days, pretty much every boy at school loved Star Wars, even acting out scenes with the one or two girl fans during recess. But as the years passed, boys started realizing they were supposed to like football, not Boba Fett. Hot rods, not rancors. Everyone went to see the movies, but were too cool to be an open fan. If you wore a ROTJ tee instead of Pyromania, you were a nerd. Nobody wanted to be a nerd back then. You. Just. Were.

I love reading the TLJ hate from pretentious brats about it ruining their childhood. Their children. Their very lives. These twenty or thirty-somethings that have trendy tattoos of troopers and trash compactors. 

You must be rebels.

I waited almost 35 years to see Luke ignite another lightsaber on opening night. The hairs on my neck actually stood on end when he strode through the battered doors to face the Empire with a laser sword. I seen him go out with a bang and a whimper, in monsterous surround sound, sharp digital clarity, reclining seats, and my own tub of popcorn.

Full disclosure, I'm considering this in relation to Machete Order (IV V II-CW-III VI). What I want 
the dip into Clone Wars to deal with is:

-Anakin in general. The show goes a long way in warming you to Ani while making his transition very believable. Exploring this would make his downfall in Sith more compelling imo.

-Dooku and Grievous. They're extremely underdeveloped in the movies so it'd be cool to have more of them in the viewing order.

-Yoda. More specifically his arc where he works out how to be a force ghost. I'm only mentioning it because it'd factor into how many episodes can be included. A short list of 10-15 episodes would be ideal so as not to interrupt the movies too much. If anyone can help that'd be great!",StarWars,1523114333,nnneeeddd,4,1,True,2018-04-07

4126,I'm glad Leia wasn't killed off in TLJ and here's why,"When I saw TFA, I felt Leia was the weakest link in all the characters they brought back. Her acting was...just unbelievable to me. It took me out of the movie. At first I blamed her for just being a crappy actress. But after watching TLJ, I blame JJ for not getting the best out of Leia. 

Rian directed her brilliantly in TLJ. I actually believed her in this movie. And I dare say, it was her best acting out of any of the star wars movies to date. Rian really pushed her and she delivered. I believed every line she spoke. 

And this is why I'm glad she wasn't killed off so quickly. Had she been killed off in the 2nd act, we would not have gotten the best of Leia. Her ""work"" on this character would have never been showcased on the screen. We would have never gotten that final Luke and Leia scene, which breaks my heart every time I watch it. (I've seen TLJ 8 times now). 

""I know what you're going to say...I changed my hair"".

That line...delivered so brilliantly. So fragile. So desperate in the end, but still a glimpse of hope and humor in the most dire of times. Her performance in TLJ was flawless. Compared to TFA, which I didn't like any scene she was in. 

TLJ has many issues, Carrie Poppins being one, but I still like it. And Carrie really brought her A game with this character. She aced the conflicted feelings with her son. With Luke. With Poe. Hell, even with Holdo, she confesses too many losses...she can't take anymore. All acted and directed so wonderfully. 

Had they killed her off in the 2nd act, we wouldn't get any of these scenes, which at the time of filming, unbeknownst to all of us and the crew, would be her final scenes in life.

4129,The First Order is ridiculous,"Where exactly are they getting all these resources?

It took the Galactic empire decades to build the Death Star, and 5 years after that to build the 2nd one (probably faster since they already had the design and logistics).

But then the First Order is forced into basic exile to the Unknown Regions, an area where almost no one lives. Btw, the reason why it's called the Unknown regions is because it's incredibly dangerous to enter, which even makes the story of the first order less believable. 

But then the First Order, being a literal shadow of the Empire, constructs a planetary device, and a huge fleet bigger than the Republics...how exactly? 

It's important to realize the Empire didn't spawn out of nothing, they replaced the already wealthy Republic, and they also liquidated the Confederacy (full of galactic corporations) to pay for their expenses. 

I wish they went into more detail with the First Order, like for instance..in order to combat the lack of population, they specialized in cloning (like the empire did...) to fill in for laborers, or used extensive droid labour, and the unknown regions were actually full of resources.  But instead we are left to ponder about how the not-Empire suddenly grew to be just as powerful as the real Empire in the course of a few decades.

However, she buries this truth and convinces herself that they will someday return for her. As a result, Rey continues to style her hair into three buns (the same hairstyle she wore as a child), probably so that her parents would be able to recognize her when they came back. She stubbornly does this for many, many years.

It is only when Rey enters the cave on Ahch-To seeking out knowledge of her parents that this style changes as she comes to realize that the truth of what happened: that she was abandoned and must forge her own identity. Consequentially, her hair remains down for the rest of the film. This seems to indicate that Rey subconsciously realized the truth of what her parents had done even before Kylo Ren forced her to acknowledge it and understood that she had to move on.

It’s a long drawn out interaction with really kewl subtle sound effects that give action to the back &amp; forth in their minds &amp; it ends with Rey knowing a deep dark thing about Kylo that was buried in his mind. 

Maybe they should have had Rey tell Finn in detail how she actually escaped instead of her saying “I can’t explain it &amp; you wouldn’t believe it” on Starkiller when they are hugging upon meeting back up.

4142,Newfound respect for TFA after TLJ,"For starters, when TFA came out, my initial reaction was not a very good one. I, like many other people, felt that it was just a bunch of OT fan service and didn't really explore new plot elements. Now after watching it a few more times, that opinion has changed for the most part, and I generally consider TFA as a ""good"" movie. Wasn't terrible, but didn't blow my mind.


Now TLJ comes along, and man did that just leave a bad taste in my mouth. But, the point of this post isn't to bash TLJ, so I won't be going into full detail on that opinion. To keep it short, I for the most part agree with the general population of people who don't agree with the plot scheme of the movie, however can accept the reasoning of people who do like it (there are many people on this sub who hate it and thinks everyone else should).


Furthermore, I just rewatched TFA again the other day as I saw it was free on Comcast. The one thing I kept telling myself was ""wow, this *feels* like a Star Wars movie."" I found myself enjoying it more than I ever have before. Something about the storyline, all the characters, the little tidbits of humor, I'm not really sure how to explain it, it just worked for me. I noticed a lot more little details that ended up putting a big smile on my face. With that being said, were there still some parts of the movie I could've gone without or still didn't agree with? Of course, however the overall TONE of the movie just felt right, IMO. 


I guess the best way for me to put this is to relate when I was a kid. Growing up, the prequels came out when I was still in elementary school, but my dad showed me the OT before I saw any PT movie. Regardless, both of those trilogies I LOVED, and gave me my favorite characters (Han and Anakin/Darth Vader) whom are still my favorite to this day. 


For me looking at the new ST, I don't get that same feeling. Now can you say thats because I'm grown up now and don't view things the same? Of course, but the point is while I feel TFA took a step in the right direction, TLJ took a step back. It's almost as if TLJ felt too *mature* to be a Star Wars movie. I don't think my 8 year old self would be able to acknowledge all the inner-conflict and hate that Kylo has, nor be able to understand his character development, as I can now being in my 20's.


This ended up being a lot longer of a post than I expected, so I apologize for the long read. If anyone has any comments though I'd love to see some opinions on this! Would be nice to see if anyone else felt the same way.

4155,How I View Star Wars Canon,"People may not agree with me on this, but here's how I view Star Wars Canon:

1) To me, absolute canon will always be the Original Trilogy, the Prequel Trilogy, and The Clone Wars TV series &amp; movie. That has nothing to do with quality or preference, it's just because these exist in both Legends and Canon, and they're what George Lucas was directly involved in (not counting other projects that had his input).

2) I see Legends and Canon as 2 different continuities that are officially licensed by Lucasfilm, and Canon is just what Disney adheres to when telling new stories.

3) So I keep track of what is official Disney Canon and what is ""Canon"" within Legends, but ultimately Episodes I thru VI and The Clone Wars will always form the main foundation to me.

4) However, I also feel that Star Wars is really about telling good stories, and that Canon is a nice added detail.﻿

SPOILERS","1) Why didn't the first order jump (light speed or w/e) when they weren't in range of the fleeing resistance ships near the beginning? Said something about being out of range so have to wait for them to be out of fuel..

2) They called kylo ren back cause they couldn't cover them from that long range. Couldn't they deploy..like 100-1000 tie fighters instead to destroy the resistance ships?

3) Why didn't the acting captain tell anyone her plan? I googled it and haven't really found a satisfactory answer

4) How does rey know where kylo ren is, after she leaves luke? Like the exact coordinates of his ship. 

5) People say you can't use the force on people unsuspecting. Is snoke really that powerful to be able to do it to rey who is supposedly as strong as kylo ren? 

6) How is snoke able to force push/pull general hux when hes on a completely different ship. Just a projection kills luke 

7) Why didn't rey and ben use the force at all in the throne room fight? 

8) I swear I say some black robed guys in snoke's throne room before. What were they doing? They're not in the fight scene 

9) When kylo ren tells the ATATs to increase firepower (MORE!!) and the guy in his ship pushes the lever forward, what is he doing?! Their actual ship isn't firing, and they're not on an ATAT. Unless that one ship controls the firepower for the ATATs? 

10) Why didn't the ace pilot of the resistance (forgot his name) shoot out the bridge of the dreadnought? He already cleared all the surface cannons and he flies by the bridge.

11) How did the codebreaker know about the transports and their cloaking? I thought only people on the ship knew about that plan.

- The resistance already has some frigates in orbit of the planet, waiting for transports from the surface of the planet to arrive.  

- The FO fleet killer cannons are clearly very powerful, but have a fairly long recharge.  

- The base on the planet is stationary. Its not going anywhere. The resistance fleet is mobile and can escape at any moment. This SHOULD make it the priority target, no?

1. Luke starts every single fight with Vader. He’s always first to fire up his lightsaber.

2. In the OT (and up until Mace Windu ignites his purple blade in II), you could tell what what rank a Jedi held based on the color of their lightsaber. 
Red = Dark side always (duh).
Episode IV: Kenobi - Blue - Jedi Knight. 
Episode V: Skywalker - Blue - Jedi Knight. 
Episode VI: Skywalker - Green - Jedi Master (only one left/ master by default)
Episode I: Qui-gon - Green - Jedi Master. 
Kenobi - Jedi Knight. 

Of course, I’m the prequels it’s established that Kenobi was in fact a master, but this isn’t known in the OT.

4187,My Frustrations with Finn,"I was in a good mood until I saw the top post for today. I try to stay positive, but it just reminded me of one of the biggest reasons I hate this new trilogy with a burning passion.

Finn is probably the most pathetic character in all of Star Wars, and I can't for the life of me understand why. They keep putting him in duels only for him to lose and get saved by something extraneous, he rarely shows any skill as a combatant (which is important in a series of action films), he's not that smart, he doesn't have any real motivations or notable skills, he never takes charge, he just exists.

Most of his screen time is him acting scared, selfish, or like an idiot, and even his greatest moments end in failure, and are massively outshined by the accomplishments of others. His story was one of the worst parts of the newest film. Seeing all the jokes about how he sucks and always will just makes me wish he _did_ die in TLJ, just so the suffering ends. Most people either hate him, consider him a joke, or ignore him altogether.

What a massive waste on Disney/Lucasfilm's part, one of the most interesting character concepts reduced to basically nothing. And it's doubly disappointing as a black person to see the one black guy perpetuating stereotypes and ending up as the joke of the trilogy.

The maiden name of Snape's mother was Prince. Ben Solo's mother is an actual princess. 

Snape inherited his wizarding abilities from his mother. Ben inherited his Force abilities from his mother. 

Snape's father was a muggle, thereby making him a half-blood. Han Solo wasn't Force-sensitive, which makes him the Star Wars equivalent of a muggle.

Lily Evans was an exceptionally gifted muggle-born witch.

4203,An observation about how the fanbase judges these movies.,"We tend to lean heavily on *events* rather than *theme*. I think a major reason people who hated TLJ do so much is because of the lack of progress in terms of story- canto bight leads to nothing. Finn is considered “useless” purely on the face value of what he’s *done*, not *who he is*. He fails against all his opponents, and we slap a label of “useless” on him, overlooking the causes for his actions. He’s gone from a coward who only fought to protect rey (the first person who’s ever shown appreciation of him) to facing down his superior officer in battle and finally coming to terms with his purpose as a rebel, rather than rey’s protector. Canto bight isn’t about what was achieved, but about Finn learning more about the galaxy he’s been hidden from, rose expanding her story and the world building (state-of-the-galaxy war profiteering etc). 

People are upset with Luke for this reason- focusing on his actions rather than the intention. He did not try to kill Ben solo in the film, as we are told by kylo. The truth is revealed, and he did not ever act to kill Ben, but rather suffered a brief faltering moment of doubt at the wrong time. His descent into cynicism is a result of his own views, that his presence causes conflict, and not because he attempted to kill his nephew. Luke is an example of people not seeing the difference- his character is not assassinated. He never acts to kill his nephew, but rather he has a brief falter in the expression of his character (working for the collective good). In his mind, he searches to make things right, and in delving to ben’s mind he sees evil taking worse shapes than his father in his future, and instinctively thinks to stop it from happening to serve the collective good. In that brief moment his lightsaber is activated, and Ben falls into the same pitfall we all did- luke would never act to kill Ben, but rather intended to serve the collective good, but the expression of his instinct was misplaced.

Snoke is often cited as a waste, as was phasma, but never in the films do they state their power or feats. They are what they are, and watching TFA again clearly shows them for what they are. Phasma is a shiny trooper with little else, having no more than 2 mins of screen time. She is never shown to be anything more than a stormtrooper with shining armour, and snoke is a husk of a character that stands in as the palpatine figure. Thematically, his only purpose is to evolve Ben solo. He is never stated to be anything more than that, and claiming these characters were a “waste” is a *direct result of expecting more than was ever shown.*

There will inevitably be people who rebuke this with other statements. Please be civil, and think through this before judging a character. Episode 6 is often a fan favourite because of its events, but thematically characters such as Han get shafted. His development is all in V, and in ROTJ he only helps to move the plot forward by events over theme.

In conclusion: TLJ is a different Star Wars movie, and a good film. If you did not like it, that does not make it a bad films I liked it, personally, but that isn’t what makes it good. I admire it for its ability to move the plot forwards via theme rather than events- the film is a long chase, and characters are the focal point rather than the feats they display. It’s bold, fresh and exciting, personally. I suppose in a saga primarily shown to us through events, this change is unwelcome and jarring to some (not saying everyone who disliked it did so for this reason, though). 

Finally, I’d like make note of kylo ren, and why his turn is so compelling and in line with theme over action.

Anakin’s turn (which I loved) is much more driven by action. The events that shape him such as his mother’s death and padme’s demise in his vision are what drive him to the dark side, combined with palpatine‘s guiding hand and the Jedi council’s lying and perceived betrayal of him.

Conversely, Ben Solo’s fall isn’t a fall in the slightest. He sees it as an ascension- Luke’s (perceived) betrayal is the only event that catalysed his choice to join Snoke. His choice to do so is entirely his own, which is a parallel to anakin who turned to save everyone he loved, only to end them tragically. Ben solo does so out of a lust for power and to become as feared as Vader, but ultimately chooses to kill everything that held him back and rise to become more than Vader and Luke, and usurps Snoke’s throne. In doing so, Kylo shows us his intentions and character are what drive his ascension, rather than the events around him. He is never forced to the dark side, but chooses it as a path to power. This is where Vader failed. The events that shape Vader’s story are people- padme, obi wan and luke. But ultimately it was luke who prevented Vader from success and saved Anakin at last, with the event of realising people he cared about were still alive. Ben solo succeeds to rule the galaxy as a result of his will to ascend the past, and to not be seduced as Vader was. Hence, the past must die, as the past holds you back.

4209,What Rebels Could've Handled Better in Retrospect,"Howdy, all.

First off, I quite care for Rebels. That is, once it found its groove much like The Clone Wars. But, I watched only the first couple episodes of Season 1 before tuning out due to animation, some of the plots and that slingshot. But after Season 2 I was invested and a fan, and Season 3 onwards was just as good as any Star Wars show.

Anyways, for all it did well, I feel like there were three big things to me that the show could've done instead of what was done to make it better. 

1) More Kallus in Season 4b. I feel we didn't get enough Kallus in the last half of Season 4, which doesn't make sense as there should have been room to explore now that he is *openly* a rebel and adjusting to his life outside The Empire. Not to say we needed a three episode arc, just one episode and have him feature in a couple, which is what I expected of such a formerly important character.

2) Ezra's Darkside Arc was brought up, with the holocron, Maul calling him his apprentice, even the promotional images as well as a few other things. But then after getting angry a little and looking into the holocron, it just sorta...disappears. Then when Maul comes again he refers to Ezra as his apprentice despite interacting with him so little. I feel even just a three episode arc with Ezra dealing with these influences, perhaps communicating with Maul (which would have given him more of a presence in the show before popping in to die) would have given Ezra a bit more depth and overcoming it. I mean, why promote that part of the story if you're going to do nothing with it?

3) Have Thrawn's victory at Chopper Base be more crushing. It is true he did have a pretty good victory at that base, but even still it was bittersweet: all major chracaters survived with only one notable death of a secondary character, Thrawn suffered a bit of a loss still. I would've preferred one of the major characters dying or having some major thing happen to them, and have his victory be definitive and crushing rather than still giving some small victory to the rebels. Because with his recent major loss at Lothal, it would've felt more impactful had he been successful completely prior. 

Anyways, just my thoughts. How about y'all?",StarWars,1520387417,King-Of-The-Raves,11,8,True,2018-03-06

4211,Rey's backround raised on Jakku,"So basically, one of the claims for Rey not being a Mary Sue is bascially that since she was raised on Jakku in such a dangerous envirnment, she must have learned to fight and that explains it pretty well. 

This argument even now comes up on the Wikipedia page about Mary Sue that was repeated by some writer or someone in the industry (I don't recognize the name of who said it). 

Here's the thing, this argument actually points towards Rey always having been a Mary Sue by applying just a little logic, the argument falls apart.

*Allow me to explain.* Look at Rey as a whole, she has no scars (not on the face anyway, but when you fight the face takes plenty of hits), she has all her teeth in perfect shape, and she has no awkward limp or movement from a bone that never healed right. 

In other words, she is in really good shape despite the claim she was in SO many fights that she must have learned to survive or become this great figher. 

SO based on Rey's apperance and shape she is in, there are only two options to explain it:

**A)** her upbringing wasn't so hard cause she is in great shape meaning she never got into all these fights 

**B)** she never lost a fight to the point of permanent injury out of ALL those fights people claim make her so tough…

If Rey did have any kind of physical wound or drawback and anything at all in that respect, it would be evidence towards the claims she learned to fight by getting into many fights, but we dont see it...


thus making her backstory also point towards being a Mary Sue. there are many things like this you can think about that point toward her being a mary sue, even things people say make her NOT a mary sue. I figured i'd stay on one at a time and just let people discuss this one.

Was Palpatine's name ever revealed in a book or in the OT's extras that gave away the twist? I know the first 2 episodes gave subtle clues and hints but imo they arent enough to deduce he is the big bad of the whole saga especially since his face isnt deformed like we see in the original trilogy.

4238,"Just watched the last 3 episodes of SWR, here are my thoughts.","The way they ended it off in the last few episodes, tieing together the clone wars, rebels, and the original trilogy was amazing. Although I imagined Ezra's ""death"" to be a little more...spectacular, I was only slightly disappointed by the very ending. It made me feel I just ended another episode, not the finale. Some things I think could have been done to improve it are:

Sabines hair should've been grown out instead of cut short. I think overall it would've been cool to see her with long hair as our final model, not with awkward short hair.

Again, Ezras ""death"". In my mind I imagined something spectacular, leading to an end that was emotional and fulfilling, but I was greatly disappointed. If only Disney could've dropped the kid friendly act for a single scene and had a sad death, not one that's going to lead to multiple theories and that wasn't really an ending to Ezras character.

Adding on to what I said in the previous paragraph, I wish, if just for this episode, we got a little darker and more satisfaction from the ending. Gregor dying was sad, it brought back memories from the clone wars during his amnesia time, but he was an expendable character, his death could've been earlier in the series. If Zeb died, or Kallus, or even Hondo, it would have had more of an impact especially since Ryder was kinda just standing around for all of episode 15 until the very end. He could have died. I also wish we got to see some more inner darkness from Ezra, for example maybe him breaking someone's neck with the force or someone shooting gov.price in the head. That would've made the scene where he destroyed the last part of the Jedi temple more eye opening, as he would have no longer been conflicted with the force. Some people who believe his conflict ended when Kanan died might disagree, but that's my thought. 

As usual, we see no more violence then what we saw in any other episode, just bodies flying around with no gore or anything, just a scorch mark on white armor. Some more...satisfyingly killed imperial would have been nice. And really, how the hell did Hondo's pirate partner survive that shot? That was pretty damn cheesy. Like come on, you're really gonna have a cheesy dramatic bromance moment at the series finale of a show that's been hyped for months?

Overall, I think the finale was pretty cool, especially the scene with Ahsoka and Sabine trying to find Ezra, and Hera's kid was absolutely adorable. I'm very happy with that scene. I expected some kind of throwback scene, like the millenium falcon flying through the sky at the very end(seeing how the s3 finale seems to be when ANH starts taking place) or some kind of throwback to one of the trilogies. I doubt I'm the only one that really wanted Ezra and Sabine to kiss, but I guess after Kanan and Hera's moment that might've seemed like reusing content. I think the biggest unanswered questions are:

Is Hera's kid force sensitive?
Where is Ezra?
Why was Ahsoka wearing light grim reaper style clothing? After she went deeper into the temple, what did she learn? Did she realign herself in the force, which could lead to a new type of force role in episode 9?
Does this mean Rex is the guy in ROTJ on Endor?
Will Ahsoka train Sabine more in lightsaber combat?

Now if you have played the games, Vader repeatedly betrayed and wrecked Starkiller in order to maintain his image of loyalty to the emperor which could have been a contributing factor to his disfigurement later on. Snoke is also revealed to not actually be a Sith Lord.

4263,"I want to talk about Dark Empire and Palpatine's ""Endless Clones""","Having just got done with a post RotJ reread of Legends I want to talk about Palpatines Clones and their impact on the rest of the EU as people always bring this up. 

Now this isn't about the art which I personally think looks bad for the most part (though it does have a few good splash pages). 

Or about how it goes from the Rebels winning the year before against Thrawn then the Empire taking back Coruscant and putting the NR on the run again until a year later the NR is in charge and acting like nothing happened except for little one off lines here and therr (which is a problem I have with it). 

Or about how suppousdly makes Vader's sacrifice  pointless (which is something I'm on the fence about.) Also this was way before the Chosen One prophecy was a thing. Also it was acctually Lucas' Idea for it to be Palpatine's clone instead of a person pretending to be Darth Vader. 

""How did you come up with the idea of bringing back the Emperor?

TOM: Our original proposal was to bring back Darth Vader's costume and mask, with somebody else inside it. We felt the Empire would want to maintain the fearsome image of Vader and wouldn't much care who was wearing the armor and breathing mask. George vetoed that idea (although he did allow us to have Vader appear in dreams and memories). He said, no, you can't bring back the Vader costume...but if you can figure out how to bring back the Emperor, that's o.k.""

http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2016/08/interview-with-dark-empire-writer-tom.html 


Or about how it has half of all the superweapons that appear in the New Republic era

This is about the number of clones and their impact on the rest of the EU. 

For the most part Dark Empire is self contained. It is a series of 14 comic issues that takes place in a single year. Out side of it we don't hear much. Luke and others make vague references to it in multiple books, mainly dealing with Luke's brush with the dark side. Wedge ends up cleaning up much of the post battle damage while taking a break from fighter duty in one book, and a few warlords mention almost having remade the empire. Ohh and Mara doesn't think it was the real Palpatine and thinks Luke was an idiot during the comic. But other than that it doesn't really impact any other stories. 

And as for future stories. Well Thrawn has a clone that dies before it can be ""born"". Issard may or may not have had a clone (or just multiple personallity disorder). And Palpatine cloned a few of his inquisitors who went all crazy and destroyed the research base (I guess starkiller scared him). But they aren't really directly connected to Dark Empire other than cloning. And we have a series all about clones that people love but its not connected to Dark Empire. 

So it only lasts a year and their are no future clones outside the series and it doesn't really affect the rest of the universe that much. So what about the number of clones. 

The ""Endless"" number isnt' really so endless. Palpatine has three clones that he uses in the series. Three, not three hundred. He *had* more clones that he could have jumped into after his body was killed or the clones body died of dark side damage but they were either destroyed by Luke or by Palpatines own people who wanted power for theirself. 

And it wasn't like these were walking thinking active clones. These were just bainless meat bags hanging in their cloning tanks untill Palpatine moved his soul into them. So their was only ever one palpatine running around at a time. 

Also Palpatines plan makes sense in context. This is a guy whos master tried to defeat death (tough we can discount this part for the moment since that doesn't get invented till EP III and were only talking about Dark Empire as it came out), who always had a plan and a back up plan and a dozen plans after that, and who set up a whole war based around cloning and clones. 

Also at least he came back in a new body unlike a certain Zabrak Sith Lord. And in a way Palpatines final defeat is really cool. It shows that now matter how much he or the dark side tries to trick the light, tries to win, tries to defy fate the good guys/ light side will always win in the end. 

TLDR: In Dark Empire Palpatine only used 3 clones and their was only ever 1 Palpatine walking around at a time. ",StarWars,1520434004,roninjedi,3,7,True,2018-03-07

I suppose there's the chance that the doorway functions as Palps described it, effectively removing a powerful enemy from existence.  But even here, Ezra is powerful in his own right. Without Palps being in the room to control the artifact, Ezra could potentially alter reality to cause Palps to be destroyed.

4280,Episode IX should be about honoring the legacy of the OT heroes (via the ST heroes).,"One of the biggest complaints about the ST so far is the perception that Lucasfilm has essentially thrown the victories on the OT in the trash.  I don't fully agree with that sentiment, but I can definitely understand it.  The truth is that our heroes didn't go on to be as successful as we all hoped they would be (thought I reject the notion that this means they were all FAILURES). 
 
So think of where we are at the end of TLJ:  Han is dead.  Luke is dead.  Leia is probably on her way on the door (RIP Carrie).  And the First Order is setting up shop on the galaxy's major worlds.  

Things look bleak, but there is a TREMENDOUS opportunity here for them to use this as a launching point to honor the OT heroes.  That's why I hope IX takes place only a year after TLJ.  They shouldn't let the ""victory"" of the First Order sink in.  

The story for IX should be that the galaxy needs to rise up NOW and prevent the First Order from destroying the legacies of the OT heroes.  Don't let them seize the power that they desire so badly.  When IX begins, Rey could be trying to recruit some new Jedi to honor Luke's sacrifice.  Poe could be trying to unite the worlds of the Republic that want to resist the First Order's occupation.  And Finn could perhaps attempt to spark a Stormtrooper revolt from within the First Order itself.  

Luke, Han, and Leia fought so hard to rid the galaxy of the Empire.  Let's honor their sacrifices and not let a new one take its place.  Don't let the First Order take root.

4284,Snoke Origins Trilogy. My thoughts / speculative premise.,"I would wager more than 5 Republic Credits that RJ's trilogy will cover the origins and rise of 'Snoke'. It's canon that he's something like a few hundred years old (at least from what I've picked up). How much ya wanna bet that each movie covers young/middle-age/old (as we know him) Snoke? 

&amp;nbsp;

It's now known (to my understanding) that Rian and JJ did in fact discuss Snoke's origins and came to some understanding or agreement as to what those were, but ultimately couldn't make it into TLJ. This may very well be why Rian was so quickly given the reigns to develop a new trilogy.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I wonder if a so-called 'Snoke Origins' trilogy synopses might go something like this:

&amp;nbsp;

* **Snoke Episode 1:** A young man encounters obstacles at a transformative time in his life, and discovers a mysterious power which takes his life into directions he never thought possible.

* **Snoke Episode 2:** Decades into his education of what he has now come to know as The Force, this once naive young man slowly transforms into someone more sinister - and more powerful.

* **Snoke Episode 3:** Having assumed or taken great political power and wealth over the course generation, Snoke has masterfully placed himself into position to take control of the once mighty Galactic Empire – but first, he must set the stage to eliminate the last obstacles to his plan: The Skywalkers.

# TL;DR 

I think Rian and JJ definitely agreed upon what Snoke's backstory is, but with the realization or understanding that it couldn't be told in Episode VIII, that backstory was approved by Kathleen Kennedy as a standalone trilogy that tells Snoke's backstory from a boy or young man, leading up to when we first see him in Episode VII. This trilogy will provide much fan-demanded context to the character, and give the opportunity to follow a dark-side 'protagonist'.

4287,The scene when R2D2 was with Vader when Vader was about to slaughter the Separatist Leaders on Mustafar is quite sad,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYcUq4g6rGs

Anakin told Artoo to stay with the ship and then he walked in and killed the Separatists without any mercy. It's like you are a war hero, but then one day, you decide to commit Jedi holocaust and overthrow democracy. There is too much blood on your hand but you cannot stop now and you are about to do more horrible deeds. And your loyal dog is still with you through everything. So to preserve your dog's good image of you, you tell him to stay in the car while you are about to walk into the house and commit more murder.

It is even worse, R2D2 probly saw Anakin marching into the Jedi temple with the clones during Order 66. After Order 66, Anakin got back to Padme's apartment with R2.

R2 was doing some worrying beep sounds to C3PO and Threepio said ""Take care my little friend"".

We don't have much information about what R2 was doing during Order 66 but it seems like he observed some really disturbing scenes. And pretty much he was screaming internally the whole time Artoo was with Anakin.

After Obi Wan defeated Anakin, Obi walked back and met Artoo. Artoo did another sad beep.

4289,What Could the Next Animated Series Be? [Spoilers for StarWars Rebels],"Now that Rebels is over we all perhaps have a lot of new theories in mind for what's to come! I'm honestly up for whatever Dave Filoni and Lucasfilm Animation decides to do next!

Here are three animated projects I would like to see in the future:

*Star Wars: Resistance*

A micro-series similar in both style and length to that of the 2003 Clone Wars series following the characters of Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo in the inevitable time gap leading up to Episode IX.

*Star Wars: The Siege of Mandalore*

An animated film acting as a proper ending to The Clone Wars following Ahsoka Tano after she turns away from the Jedi Order.

*Star Wars Rebels 2.0*

A continuation of the epilogue in the grand finale of Star Wars Rebels following Sabine and Ahsoka in their search for Ezra. With the Empire dealt with Filoni and his team would be able to focus on telling a story without having to worry about the films too much. New planets, characters, and threats could be introduced. The Unknown Regions could be explored. The Chiss Ascendency could play a major role in the story. Think of this series as the Beast Machines to Beast Wars or The Legend of Korra to Avatar: The Last Airbender.

These are things I would like to see. What are you expecting to see next now that Rebels has ended?",StarWars,1520453768,ThatGeek303,24,16,True,2018-03-07

4291,(Spoilers) Just some respect an appreciation for Rebels and it's creators,"We've just finished Rebels and we're so content with how everything ended. It shows the talent and skill of Filoni and his team, and the freedom they have, to create something like this.

The whole finale we were waiting for Ahsoka to drop in, but that didn't happen. In hindsight, that would have been to ""cheap"" and OMG did we get something better.

We never dared to dream that Rebels would include scenes from the time after the battle for Endor! 
That part left us with too many emotions to handle and goosebumps everywhere. 

Seeing that everyone who survived the finale are still around. The confirmation that Rex was there is so amazing!

Hera and her little kid is exactly what she deserved after everything she's done. Her happiness is so good to see. She's one of the best characters Star Wars has ever produced.

Sabine narrating the piece was the perfect choice, and she seems even wiser now. Still looking cool and different.

THE BEST PART: AHSOKA!!!!!!
My son and I both screamed out of enjoyment to see her standing there. She's at least our favorite character that hasn't appeared in a movie (yet) and maybe even our favorite Star Wars character ever.
My son grew up with The Clone Wars first and now Rebels, so the moment she appeared will forever be in our memories.

So special thanks from me and my son to:

- Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, Carrie Beck and their team!

One of the biggest revelations they’ve said is that Snoke heard the same power that was calling out to Palpatine from the Unknown Regions, which was revealed in the *Aftermath* trilogy. He was able to get there before Palpatine did. So, to me it seems that Snoke traveled out there, found this being offering knowledge and power, and Snoke became powerful enough to command the First Order as Supreme Leader. I think that Snoke was a pawn/tool for this higher power from the Unknown Regions, serving its ends, not just his own. I wonder, with Snoke now dead, will this being call to Kylo? I’m now kinda cool with Snoke being killed off like that, he was nothing more than a stooge for someone far more powerful. What do you think?",StarWars,1520459824,DaTruestEva,22,4,True,2018-03-07

There is something in the discussions about Luke's character and behavior that I haven't seen mentioned. So the theory is Luke is haunted by his failures driving him to his current hermit-like existence and ""crusty"" exterior. After being found, he also learns about Han's death. This is obviously traumatic for him to learn, but no one seems to be discussing that he clearly blames himself for this. Kylo's fall is his biggest failure which ultimately led to the death of perhaps his best friend. Just another potential reason for Luke's behavior in the movie. Thoughts?

4301,Do not fear Snoke lovers he will be used because they keep mentioning Snoke in other media [Spoilers],"Snoke is getting hyped up in the novel of TLJ and other things for Star Wars. Along with another element which is in The Last Jedi Artbook. I have been reading it/still reading it and enjoying it but what is interesting is in the notes that they put in. They have a whole bit when they talk about Han Solo and Kylo Ren scene in TFA. It frames they do have a story plan and collectively all been involved with the story crafting of these movies-- not just Johnson. They deliberately say they held back some stuff in TFA Artbook because they wanted to keep stuff under wraps (more specifically with Han).  

We now have Game of Thrones Creators getting a Movie(s) and a new trilogy for Rian Johnson. Both these batch of movies could easily be Snoke focused  especially Rian Johnson batch because he had input on the novel of TLJ. Along with the whole clear idea to make a lot of media for Star Wars means they have plenty of time and space to do Snoke and the fact that they keep mentioning/hyping Snoke and left him mysterious means they can easily do something with him. If they never mentioned him in other media that would make it more likely they done.

So easily could make Snoke an antithesis of Luke Skywalker or something completely different. They talk about how Snoke has meet Skywalker in one account I seen with the novel for TLJ. Examples a scrub like me think up from the top of my head- make Snoke a galactic hero like Luke Skywalker that collapsed over time or hero for the 'darkside' from another galaxy. They could easily have a whole setup with him forming an empire in another galaxy and leaving or overthrown/he be like if Luke Skywalker became the emperor and maybe got booted or another reason evacuated. I aint in a story group member or in their think tank  yet can think of stuff as could many others. We individuals. They are a think tank or story group so of course they going to be able to if they havnt already. Lucasfilm are in for the long haul and have all the time to do stuff with Snoke and if they keep hyping him up in other medias that makes it very likely they not done with him. 

Also just look at Lost. JJ Abrams is Lostifying Star Wars so much -- which breeds frustration for sure makes others utterly fanatical with theory crafting. How he worked with Lost and the other makers of that show was they do mysterious stuff and do explain it (whether disappointing explanation is another thing). The whole lack of answers, gaps etc is all Lost Story structure straight up but even that in the end explained a lot (not all though) and the gaps made people talk 1000 theories.

-magnetic repulsor- generator-thing
-shield generator
-life support
-nav-computer
-hyperdrive + hyperdrive motivator
-short/long range scanners

So fellow spacers, any ideas on how to make the parts acquisition interesting and engaging?

I believe Phasma could have been treated a lot better, and given a far bigger role.

In my eyes, she could have been the next Vader (or what Grievous could have been) in terms of a towering masked villain who's feared by most in the galaxy. She felt like the Terminator when she walked through the burning village and hanger bay.

On a side note, I think she should have been sent to Canto Bight to capture Finn and *Poe-* I mean Rose. This would have tied their subplot to the main storyline very nicely.

I just wanted to give my thoughts on how her character could have been handled. If you agree or disagree, let me know why. I want to have a *general discussion* about her character (pardon the pun).

4311,The Rebels blew up Alderaan,"When we analyze the facts it becomes clear the rebels blew up Alderaan, and the empire reluctantly under distress took credit for blowing up Alderaan so it would not cause panic, further the evil rebellion.

Here is what we know.

1) Alderaan blew up after a rebel raiding party snuck into the death star with the help of a Jedi.

2) Death star was designed to combat invading genocidal aliens species that ended up killing hundreds of trillions of sentient life forms. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong

3) Death star was never used to blow up planets other than when rebels happen to hijack death star even though it could of been many times.

4) Rebels had much to gain from blowing up Alderaan. While the empire had nothing to gain. The destruction of Alderaan enabled the rebels to paint the empire as evil. Provided their ""justification"" to kill millions of people(mostly civilian contractors) on death star. The Rebels bragged about killing people, committed many acts of terror, while the empire did not. The emperor and empire tended to forgive when possible, while the rebels were terrorist and bragged about killing people. Normally the empire would let everyone know the truth however due to preparing for war they needed to end rebellion quickly, to save the galaxy. From a genocidal alien species that would eventually cost over 4 trillion sentient life due to rebels succeeding

5) Empire was formed through widespread support of almost every planet and thunderous applause. While the rebel empire was formed through terrorism, war, violence bragging about death. Which side do you think would blow up a planet ?",StarWars,1520471827,Onearmplanche,14,0,True,2018-03-07

The OT heroes succeeded where the PT heroes failed.  Luke is able to bring the Chosen One back to the light, which in turn leads to the destruction of the Empire.  But in the aftermath of Endor, the OT heroes failed to completely finish off the Imperial Remnant and restore the Jedi Order, which eventually leads to the rise of the First Order.

4316,[general] Leaving the Galaxy,"So, I heard some rumors (that I believe) that Kathleen Kennedy and Rain Johnson will have the next saga take place in a completely different galaxy so they can create a complete cast of new characters completely unrelated to anyone in this galaxy.

Now, I am not happy with the new trilogy so much, but life goes on and there is always potential for good stories even after my favorite OT characters no longer appear in SW movies.

But, leaving the Galaxy completely I think would really end it for me. It just wouldn't really be SW to me at all. It would be this: Disney bought the rights to put lightsabers and the Force in a new sci fi series.

There is no reason to rid off ALL that came before since its some of the best and classic stroytelling, characters, and world creation in history. Kind of like trying to put the Beatles back together and expecting the same results, or having some dude get on stage dress up as Micheal Jackson and try to fill his shoes. I just don't think its possible.

2. When did star wars become star trek: seriously space whales and time travel. Isn't that the story line of a voyage home? All kidding aside it's becoming more like startrek.

3. Cannon isn't even cannon.. seems like the lucasfilm story group isn't even following their own cohesive story.  I feel as though they say that it's all one story but it isn't. 

4. Wasted character development: this happened in both last jedi and rebels.  We get invested in characters ie. Rey and Ezra just to have them be used as wasted plot devices.

4351,Why I think a stormtrooper rebellion makes more sense for Episode IX,"With the deleted Finn vs. Phasma scene that was revealed yesterday, I've been thinking about the potential of a stormtrooper rebellion. 

Personally, I don't mind that the scene was cut because I think Finn trying to start a stormtrooper rebellion makes more thematic sense if it happens in IX, as a follow-up to Rose's whole ""saving instead of killing"" line. He doesn't seem to have too many qualms about killing other stormtroopers in TFA and TLJ. 

But if he were to take Rose's words to heart, see the troopers' potential to turn on the First Order like he did, and start trying to save them instead of killing them, that'd be a really cool way to see that theme play out in Finn's storyline. 

Plus, maybe it could be a good source of conflict and development between Finn and Poe, who might be less hesitant about attacking the First Order's troops since the Resistance is so low on numbers.",StarWars,1520519822,seleniumdrive,9,26,True,2018-03-08

4355,"I fail to see how Luke was ""Character Assassinated"" in The Last Jedi","I've seen/ read at least a dozen posts/ videos/ etc. on the matter and so far none of them have presented anything substantial apart from ""It wasn't what I expected therefore I didn't like it.""

No I should stress before I begin, if you did not like how Luke was in The Last Jedi, that is perfectly fine. You have your reasons and you should stick by them.

On to the subject at hand, I fail to see how Luke Skywalker had his character *Assassinated* in The Last Jedi. His actions and words are certainly surprising but out of character? No, I don't see this at all.

I can somewhat understand it when you think back to Luke in Return of the Jedi and how he was there in contrast to in The Last Jedi. But then I remind myself *30 years have passed* and some crazy *stuff* has happened in his life and Han and Leia's lives, of course he isn't going to be the exact same person he once was.

But the young Luke I grew up with isn't gone entirely either. The look on his face when he see R2 was pure magic, couple with the fact that he is on the Falcon and when Leia's message is shown. These three elements were what started Luke on his Journey way back when and here they are again to put him back on track. 

A similar feeling occurs when Yoda shows up (Which put the biggest, dumbest grin on my face when he burns down the tree) and Luke once again reverts to his young self as his long passed master teaches him one final lesson.

And now let's get to the elephant in the room, Luke contemplating about killing Ben Solo. I'm not going to lie, this scene when I first saw it almost took me out of the movie. How on Earth could Luke even think of such an idea... then it hit me like a tonne of bricks upon second viewing; why wouldn't he have thought of that?

Luke has a somewhat lengthy history of being a very emotionally reactive individual. He races back to his home when he learns Stormtroopers might be there, he goes to save his friends when he learns they could be in danger even when both his masters tell him no, he attempts to strike down the emperor, he nearly kills his father when Vader threatens his sister and so on so forth.

He isn't exactly a wise master either. Rey disregards his lessons in favour of taking the books to learn for herself, books that he didn't bother reading either. He had the equivalent of a weekend's worth of Jedi training that he didn't even complete, he was never taught how to deal with this sort go thing and he thought he could handle it because *He's Luke Skywalker* and he can't possibly fail right?

Luke has seen the face of pure evil and what it can do to people. When he probes though Ben's head, we don't know what he is seeing. He could be seeing Ben killing Han, Starkiller base blowing up the planets, Ben firing on his mother, anything terrible. I don't doubt for a second that his split second instinct was to *Kill the boy* only to say after *What the hell is wrong with me!?* Only to have the have everything he had built burn before his eyes for his thought crime.

Luke throwing away his light sabre isn't meant to be a joke, it is his way of saying *Fuck all of that, I tried and I failed, leave me alone*.

This isn't character assassination in the slightest.

Well that was long winded and I'm pretty sure people will point out the obvious faults with my points.

4360,THEORY: Snoke was a secret part of Palpatine's Contingency.,"Per the Aftermath books, we know that Palpatine put in place a plan to deconstruct and rebuild the Empire.  My proposition is that this Contingency had two primary components.  

But before I get into that, let me put forth an idea regarding who Snoke was:
 
Perhaps Snoke was simply an acquaintance of Palpatine who had a ton of Force potential, but whom Palpatine refused to train (since he didn't want a challenger to the throne).  Instead, he made Snoke the beneficiary of all of his dark side knowledge/research in the event of his untimely demise.  

So the Contingency's two primary components were:

1. Gallius Rax would unite the strongest remnants of the Empire and let the rest perish.
2. Snoke would begin to train himself in the dark side and would eventually seize the throne of the Imperial Remnant for himself.

Given Snoke's considerable potential, he quickly began to master the dark side of the Force.  It was only a matter of time before he would officially assume command of the Imperial Remnant and reorganize it into the First Order.

I like this theory for a few reasons:

1. It's rather simple.  Like the rest of the First Order, Snoke is just a part of what Palpatine left behind.  It's the Emperor's legacy.  And it's easy to explain rather quickly on screen (should they choose to do so).
2. It leaves the door open to further expand upon Snoke's backstory.  If you want more than just his role in the grand scheme of things, then there's still plenty of space for that to get fleshed out.
3. It explains why Snoke was basically a non-factor prior to the ST.

4364,"Watched TFA again yesterday. For me, it’s captured something truly special.","I won’t given an in-depth analysis, but it’s really a fun adventure that captures the “Star Wars” charm I love.

There are so many good moments that have become some of my favorites in the series, whether it’s a character scene or a battle, a visual, etc..

I really love Rey’s introduction. I think it’s one of the best scenes in any Star Wars movie, personally. I remember that was the point in the theater that I went, “oh wow this is actually Star Wars”. That entire scene made me care about her in a few minutes with no dialogue. The first time we heard her theme as she sleds down the hill,  when we see her home with a single flower she tries to keep alive and her homemade doll. And when she’s sitting outside eating, and she puts on the old helmet that’s just a tad too big for her head and pretends she’s something more.

I loved the friendships that were built with Finn and Poe, Finn and Rey. 

And of course, Kylo Ren was great through the entire thing. I’ve written tons of posts about him so I won’t go on, but I think that all of his scenes in TFA were just so magnetic. 

The snow battle visually is incredible and has an emotional punch to it, and I think more of an emotional weight after seeing TLJ. The moment when Rey pulls the saber from the snow gives me chills every time. 

And then finally when Rey goes to ahch-to and the Jedi Steps music starts up, and then slows down to the solo force them before swelling up as we see Luke for the first time in a long time. And just like the script says, it’s the promise of an adventure just beginning.

There’s a ton more I really enjoyed but I don’t have time to write it all out.

Anyway, I really enjoyed TFA and I still do over 2 years later.  It feels magical to me every time I watch it. ",StarWars,1520527476,kidwifi,33,29,True,2018-03-08

4372,"OK Disney, here's how you make The Old Republic movie/show work","When Rian Johnson's new Star Wars series of films (post sequel trilogy) was announced, a lot of people speculated it would be an Old Republic series. Similarly, when D&amp;D's (the GoT showrunners) trilogy was announced, again the comments were full of people clamoring for a KotOR movie. 

There were also a lot of people saying KotOR movies would never work; since the games were so dependent on player choice, forcing one option to be canon would alienate a lot of people. This is mainly a response to those people.

So here's the trick: *Don't tell the same story.*

I know, revolutionary. Here's the reality of things. KotOR is, as of now, not ^^Disney canon. However, there have been some references in new canon, like Malachor in rebels S2 (A complete list can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/7tevp2/what_parts_of_kotor_are_still_canon/dtc91og/)). With that in mind, it's safe to say that at least some of the creative forces behind new Star Wars media are aware of our love for KotOR. To me, it's not about *if* an Old Republic film/TV show will happen. It's about *when*. It could be a completely new story, but I think it's more likely they'll draw from Legends, as they've done in Rebels with Thrawn. So here's how I think it should play out.

* Don't make Revan the same character. He should lead the Jedi crusaders and be exiled, yes, but after that I'd like to see him become a hermit of sorts. He could be the idealized Grey Jedi. I'd like to see him interact with Kreia as well.

* Scrap Malak. He's insanely boring. He's pretty much just Revan's best friend. And then he's evil. Meetra Surik can be Revan's best bud instead.

* Focus on characters. Show Carth go from being a Patriotic Republic pilot to a jaded veteran of war. Revan and Meetra Surik learning that war isn't idealized, and trying to accept the damage they've done. Bastila going from an obedient Padawan to master of the Force.

* Make the Sith more sinister. Like Palpatine in the prequels, they should be plotting from the shadows, influencing the Mandalorians to attack the Republic and then driving the schism in the Jedi order.

* Be more philosophical. Kreia should definitely make an appearance. 

* Make it *feel* different. I want it to feel like the **OLD** Republic, not an earlier version of the prequel Republic. Some markers of technological advancement would be nice too. Maybe the hyperdrives take a minute to spin up and there aren't as many charted routes? Maybe we don't have any giant, planet destroying superweapons? More ballistic weapons? Vibroblades ^^pls and the old fashioned lightsabers Ezra finds on Malachor?

* Did I mention the Sith? More of them please. Not the boring Jedi turned bad stuff we normally see, some true masters of the dark side. There's a lot of interesting routes you could take to show the powers of the Sith - KotOR 2 did a good job of this with Sion and Nihilus.

4377,I just finished reading Catalyst. Here are my thoughts...,"I put this one off for a while and I don’t particularly know why. Rogue One is one of my favorite Star Wars movies (probably second or third) and this makes it all the more better. 

Galen starting on humanitarian projects like energy for an entire system adds so much depth to his character. Him secretly being good was one of the few complaints I had with Rogue One. This showed how he was a good man that got caught up with the wrong people, namely Krennic. 

Seeing these characters, who have only interacted with storm troopers and the Empire in the movie, talk about and work with battle droids and the Separatist really ties the universe together in a good way. Also having read “Rebel Rising” first adds a bit of tragedy to baby Jyn, who we know how hard of a life she will have, despite her parents optimism. 

Early on, Krennic’s character is portrayed excellently as well. Him being the partier, who nothing goes wrong for, shows how he acted so spoiled in Rogue One. Getting everything he wanted was a great way of setting that up. Alternatively, Galen, being sucked in his work, was completely expected and perfectly in character. 

Galen’s conversation with Tarkin was also very well immersed in the lore. Him mentioning events from The Clone Wars was a nice touch and attention to detail. 

One thing that caught me off guard, but made complete sense, was how much that the author delved into the science of the book. Of course, Galen would be focused on the science of things. Learning about the kyber crystals was super cool and interesting to me. 

The book also did a good job swapping from the prequel to the sequel era perfectly. I didn’t see the scene with the battle droids chasing them then shutting down coming.  

Seeing Saw Guerrera Back again, even in a smaller role, is always welcome. Again, reading Rebel Rising before this made him in the book have much more gravity. 

Another cool part was how the author showed how Lyra and Galen were regular people with marriage issues from time to time. Also, baby Jyn playing in the Park was very grounding. She changed the galaxy, but before that she was just a kid. 

The pun Tarkin used when he was shooting the cliff down on the vigilantes was groan-worthy (they brought it down on themselves). 

Having the Empire use Galen’s Work not as he intended was also very Empire like. Galen, being a good person wouldn’t want to make a super weapon. 

In the end, Saw Guerrera helping the Erso’s escape to Lah’mu made complete sense. Also, the head that everything came to between Lyra and Krennic perfectly tied into the movie. She was so quick to draw a blaster on him when he showed back up on Lah’Mu and now I know why. She loved Galen and was protecting him. 

Overall, I enjoyed the science aspect of the book. It gave great insight to Rogue One, as it was intended to do. I can’t wait to watch Rogue One again with all this new knowledge. 

My personal book rankings:
1. Thrawn
2. Lost Stars
3. Dark Disciple
4. Rebel Rising
5. Leia: Princess of Alderaan
6. Tarkin
7. Catalyst
8. Battlefront Twilight Company
9. Ahsoka
10. A New Dawn
11. Lords of the Sith

He who wields the dark saber rules Mandalor.

In Rebels, Maul had the dark saber, then just kind of left it for Sabine to take. She didn't really win it by combat from Maul, she just took it. So Mandalorians may not view her as the true wielder of the sword.

If that's the case, Maul possesses it until he is killed by Obi-Wan.

Obi-Wan would unknowingly possess it until he is defeated by Vader, who would unknowingly possess it until his own death. The Mandalorians may then view the next wielder to be his own children, since he wasn't defeated in combat. If Luke and Leia are both dead by the start of IX, Kylo Ren could be viewed by Mandalor as the true owner of the dark saber and the true ruler of Mandalor. 

This would add quite a bit of strength to the First Order. 

The problem is explaining the dark saber to the movie only crowd without it sounding like it came out of nowhere to explain why Mandalor supports the first order.

4391,What are you opinions on this explanation for Rey's powers?,"So im guessing this is canon since it is in TLJ novel. Maybe it will be transported and explained in 9, kind of how Rey and Poe met in TFA novel but they met in TLJ movie instead.

So anyways we finally get an explanation as to why she is so powerful so quickly. This is my understanding from the novel so if I got this wrong please feel free to correct, but I do find it interesting.

So in TLJ novel it is explained that through their force bond, Rey is able to acquire Kylo Ren's skills in the force and same for him from her. But since she has no actual force skills to pass on, Kylo is only able to see her past and her memories.

So rey is able to gain force knowledge from kylo and kylo is able too see her memories. So she kind of ""downloads"" so to speak force powers from him. Anyone else who read the book understood this?

This goes in line with what Pablo Hidalgo said when he answers to a tweet late 2015. He said that Rey was able to control that stormtrooper (Daniel Craig) in TFA and escape because she got the way to do that from Kylo's mind when she entered it during the interrogation. check here, scroll : https://journalofthestarwars.wordpress.com/social-media/

If what Pablo says is true, then this connection Rey and Kylo have was maybe planned since day 1, with JJ because it was present in TFA in some way. So, maybe this whole narrative of ""they had no plan they just went along with wtv they wanted with each director"" may not be as real as people think. Maybe they had a general idea planned out with general concepts. Maybe they had a starting point and an ending point but no middle planned out? Who knows!

So we get an explanation for the ""mary sue"" i guess! I don't know how the fandom will feel about this. 

What are your thoughts?

4398,"If it turns out that Rey will be the one to rebuild the Jedi order/ bring new force users into the fold, which the series seems to imply, how will you feel about that?","Hey, so I know this is a polarizing topic, but hoping folks from both side can discuss it fairly. One of the ideas the series seems to be building towards after ""The Last Jedi"" is that Rey will be the one to kickstart the new-age Jedi order, presumably she will use the information from the sacred texts, combined with a less strict code, to create a new wave of force users that can perhaps help achieve peace again. I'm basing this off Luke saying ""I will not be the last Jedi"" and Rey taking the books implying she will be the future. Plus the little hint with the force-wielding broom kid at the end.

My question is: Does Rey deserve this? Why could Luke not have done this? I'm asking this from both a realistic in-universe question, **and** as an out of universe question. The prequels were all about the strict Jedi order, Luke's OT story was all about him learning that the strict Jedi order is what caused Vader, and that Jedi can still love and have families and attachments. Based on that logic, based on his entire journey and his quest to redeem his father, would it not have been more sensible and logical(Both in-universe, and out-of-universe) for Luke to have kick-started the new age Jedi with love and attachments? Would it not have been sensible for him to get married and start a family of his own, while still holding the Jedi ideals?

For me, it's extra disappointing because of Luke's journey. He went through an entire journey, we watched him for years as he improved, as he failed against his enemy, and then as he won against all odds in the end, using love. That journey seemed to build to this idea of Luke starting a totally new Jedi.

Rey has had a much different journey over the 2 movies so far, and her journey doesn't feel as earned in my opinion. It's tough because so much of Rey's journey already happened before her story started. We meet her and she is a strong fighter and competent technical person, but we never see her acquire those skills. We don't see her practice with the force, even in a small way, leading up to her using intense force abilities. We don't see her lose real struggles with others(man to man conflict), we only see her lose struggles within herself. That's not terrible on it's own, but after 2 movies the fact that we haven't really seen her take a physical loss against another person lowers the stakes, and makes her feel less like an underdog up against the odds.

But most of all, her entire journey takes place within 10 days of us meeting her. That's simply not enough time for significant character change, and now we only have one film left. Even with a time gap of 1-5 years, 1 film doesn't seem like enough time for significant growth.  Rather than a stable progression over the course of the trilogy, her journey has been rapid and then will come to an abrupt halt before closing. That pacing really hurts her entire legacy, in my opinion.

I like Rey, but to me, she's not Luke. The audience hasn't been able to see her **earn** it like we did with Luke. She had the chance to have her own journey, her own failures and struggles in the Force Awakens, but she didn't, not really. What if she joined Kylo and turned to the Dark Side in Episode 8, if only briefly? That would be an interesting turn, and it would suddenly make her journey seem much more intense because of that major change. 

I know I'm crying over spilled milk here, but Luke really earned his legacy in my opinion. He deserved to have the new jedi-order, not somebody else. And I just can't figure out why they decided to write the story this way. We already saw the old Hermit jedi multiple times throughout star wars, why not show us the old light hearted Jedi? Like in those kung-fu movies, there's always the ancient master who loves to drink and be silly and have fun, but is also immensely powerful, why not make Luke that Jedi?

4407,"A good man, and the Last Jedi.","Luke in TLJ was shown as a bitter and angry old man who wanted to die alone on an island away from everyone. A lot of people hate the movie because they think Luke was portrayed as a weak coward who runs from his problems.

However, I have a different point of view, for certain. The Skywalkers have been said to be the strongest force users in the galaxy. However, let's look at what happened to them when they faced the darkside.

Anakin was seduced by the darkside because he couldn't bear to lose Padme like he lost his mother. He ended up losing everything, and all of his hatred and anger and immense grief was set loose on the entire galaxy for years in the form of Vader. He was only able to do the right thing at the very end in order to save his son.

Ben has been under attack from the dark side almost literally since he was conceived. From what we can tell, he tried so hard to fight it off for his entire life, and it made him miserable. He was incredibly powerful in the Force, but this made people afraid of him. He was sent away from his family to live with his uncle, the legendary Jedi. And yet, Luke could not keep the nightmares away. Realizing that not even Luke Skywalker - the very man who had been able to save Darth freaking Vader -  could do anything to help him probably terrified him, and then when he saw his Uncle standing over him with a lightsaber, he was finally pushed over the edge completely. He tried to follow his Grandfather's footsteps for a while by using the dark side as hard as he could in an effort to stop the constant pai he felt as his soul tore itself apart. However, even after he killed his father, he is in a constant state of turmoil, and continues to lash out at everyone.

**But Luke was different. When he lost everything, he did not turn to the dark side. He did not lash out at others and give in to the darkness that surrounded him.**

He figured that he was the problem, and banished himself to an island to die so that he wouldn't end up hurting anyone else. 

I would say that Ben has been dealt a worse hand than Luke or even Anakin, but Luke is the only one who was too strong of a person to inflict his pain on others like his father or nephew, and instead inflicted it on himself.


He is no coward. Even after all of the tragedy that he had to live through, he is still a good person that wants to protect others, even if that means that he has to protect them from himself. In the end, Luke realized what he had to do, and proceeded to perform the greatest feat of power ever attempted in order to do the right thing, one last time.



He is not just The Last Jedi.

#**He was the greatest Jedi that has ever lived.**

-I like all three of the Disney Star Wars Movies. Awakens was a lot of fun.  Last Jedi was so unique and bold.   They have their issues for sure but I'm enjoying the ride and looking forward to how it all plays out.

4423,Snoke is probably still Plagueis,"A running list of all evidence/theories:

- JJ loves surprise connections like this. Wouldn't doubt that he created Snoke to be the secret former Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Especially since the story of Darth Plagueis was the biggest cliffhanger in the prequel trilogy. It's like the one thing that was never explored in canon.
- The musical theme was the same as in the opera scene in ROTS, where Palpatine talked about Plagueis
- The intense scarring and physical alterations on Snoke's body matches up with the story of Palpatine attacking him in his sleep
- ""The Supreme Leader is *wise*"" - Kylo in TFA
- Snoke mentioned witnessing the rise and fall of the Empire, as well as the Clone Wars
- Kylo mentions the Sith when talking about ""letting old things die"" in TLJ. Why would he even acknowledge them if they were truly dead already? Perhaps Snoke/Plagueis was trying to rebuild the Sith Order because he was one?
- Snoke and Kylo are obsessed with hunting down and killing the last Jedi
- Snoke said ""I can't be beaten"" in TLJ, echoing Palpatine's claim that Plagueis knew the path to immortality
- Snoke can use Force Lightning, echoing Palpatine's claim that Plagueis taught Palpatine everything he knew (therefore Palpatine can use Force Lightning because Snoke/Plagueis taught him how)
- ""When I found you, I saw... something truly special: the potential of your bloodline."" - Snoke, who goes on to mention Darth Vader (who he is very clearly obsessed with). It makes sense, because due to Plagueis and Palpatine Force-experimenting years before, Anakin was born out of the Force. Kylo is a direct descendant of Anakin (and is therefore a descendant of a Force creation), so it makes sense that Snoke/Plagueis would want him on his side.",StarWars,1517797491,R-L-A7,14,0,True,2018-02-04

I would love some help/info regarding Star Wars !

I’m a F 21, and I have NEVER seen a single star wars film ! For no other reason than I tend to go more for comedies or musicals. 

I mean from an outside perspective, the films look and sound great, I’ve just never watched them. 

However I’m a nanny, and the little boys I look after LOVE Star Wars, always rave about Star Wars and I just cannot relate or understand anything they’re talking about ! So I think it’s time I got to watching these films! 

So my questions are;

•How good are these films? And “why” are they so good? (Presuming you will all say “good” or “great” - but wanted to ask anyway for people’s own perspective and opinions also second part of question I’m genuinely curious about as I would love to know what YOU think makes the films good) 

•How should I go about watching them? (Aka: on a weekend all at once, space out over a few weeks etc). 

•How many films and what order? 

•Is there anything I should know before I watch the films?

•Are the Star Wars films overly long? Or do any of them get slow/tedious to watch? 

•Best Star Wars snacks? (Gotta be fully prepared going into this)

4445,JJ made a mystery box; We made an Extended Universe TM,"As someone who has been critical of TLJ, I finally got the chance to rewatch TFA. I expected the experience to dig me in deeper into my jaded view of TLJ. I expected vindication to the argument that RJ had simply given a middle finger to JJ's ideas and plot. I expected to be taken back to TFA's premiere  where the mystery was fresh, new, and wonderful. 

I wasn't. TFA is a very different film to me now, after TLJ. JJ created the mystery box, we all know that. But, now I see that JJ never emphasized these mysteries in the film. The internet, time, and speculation did. The bounty of youtube reviewers, cutting a clip, slowing the film down, and zooming into an expression. That, in addition to this idea of JJ's mystery box, gave us fuel to build endless speculation and endless expectation. We took a JJ's concept and made TFA into something completely different. I hate to say it, but TFA and TLJ are congruent in story and plot. JJ and RJ clearly worked together. 

I challenge you to go back. Re-watch TFA. It isn't what the internet has made it to be. It is isn't the tinder box for a whole new extended universe that Rian Johnson failed to deliver. It's much much less than that. ",StarWars,1517802981,timewarp424,108,126,True,2018-02-04

4450,Figured out Disney executives Death Star plan...,"This came to me while working a 24hr shift at the hospital on Superbowl Sunday after the Solo trailer dropped:

Disney executives have a master plan on how to make money on their investment while generating a new fan base and keeping older fans hooked on the content.  They are going to continue to make anthology films (I.e. rogue one, solo, Kenobi etc) to appeal to older fans that enjoy classical characters and story arcs.  They know that younger fans are less likely to latch onto the original series because the special fx and gci are dated and in this 2018 world everything has to be photorealistic. However, the films that will cover the new trilogy after the force awakens will develop whole new characters and storylines geared more towards younger fans. They will continue to kill off everything related to The Original Stories because they want to get a whole new generation hooked on new characters\stories. That is why Yoda appeared in The Last Jedi and basically burned all of the old stories to the ground to teach the new generation that it's okay to let go and create new stories.

I’m alternating between trying not to laugh and calling him out for poor storytelling.  He insisted that this is a real thing among Twi’Leks.

if i’m not wrong, there’s a video from before Disney threw half of old canon into the EU describing a theory to Boba’s survival of the sarlacc pit. basically every living being, regardless of whether they are strong with the force or not, has an ability called a “Force Moment”, sort of like a last stand that can manifest in multiple ways depending on the situation. 

this would also explain Leiah’s survival, since she could’ve used the force to keep an air bubble around her, and used Newton’s 3rd law to pull herself back to the ship.

now there are 3 possibilities. 1) this is bullshit from my head. 2) this actually exists and i’m not wrong, however i did try googling stuff about this and got nothing related. 3) this is a theory simply from the video creator, and no one else.

4491,I love Battlefront II,"Okay don't kill me yet. Hear me out for a minute. What EA did with the loot boxes was a huge mistake on multiple levels. I waited until a week ago to buy the game partially because of this. But this time I went in with a clean slate for the game with zero expectations what so ever. 

I was pleasantly surprised.

The gameplay is tight, fun, and has many of my favorite scenes from the entire series thus far. Tons of the cool heroes and villains we all love are there and the ones that aren't yet are coming with time as free DLC (Finn and Phasma came  for free shortly before I got the game). Some of my favorite star fighters are in there, and even some I didn't expect but I'm glad are there anyway (Darth Maul's scimitar and Yoda's star fighter).

And now the part everyone is thinking about, loot boxes. Now that they have adjusted hero prices and loot boxes, I have had no trouble getting cards and characters. I'm talking unlocking everyone in the week's time I have had the game, and with leftover credits to buy loot boxes. While the progression isn't perfect, I get my characters I want at a fair pace, and I don't feel like it's a grind. I am aware they plan to re-add the loot boxes in the coming months, but with how easy it is to unlock content I don't ever see a reason to buy the boxes unless they implemented a cosmetics loot box in the manner of Overwatch.

The game is not perfect by any means. There is balance issues and some serverside stuff to be fixed. Some bugs can be annoying and take you out of the mood. I am having a blast with this game despite its flaws. All in all, what I am trying to say is that this is not the game everyone was saying it was going to be. People assumed because EA was publishing it and adding microtransactions that it would be ruined. This couldn't be farther from what I've seen in the last week. DICE has handled the core gameplay incredibly well. 

If you haven't tried the game or even have zero interest after the controversy, maybe give it another look, as a Star Wars fan, and see if maybe it's worth giving a shot.",StarWars,1517832237,Nomi04,21,1,True,2018-02-05

-close up of the masked villain (his eye cover does remind me of Kylo, like someone else noted here)

4500,Do we need trailers for Star Wars?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about this in the last few years even more so on the run up to TLJ. 

YouTube analysis of trailers is incredibly popular, I found myself unsubscribing from many of my usual channels because I know they will be posting lots of videos breaking any footage and leaks down to the frame looking for any little bits of information. This is great for films you’ve already seen but not so great for something new. 

I prefer to go into a film not knowing what to expect but these days most people go in to the theatre full of knowledge and an expectation of how the film is going to go down. Lots of disappointment with TLJ because it wasn’t the film many were expecting. 

The same is starting to happen now with Solo. YouTubers are racing to be the first to post their analysis of their trailers with the thumbnails full of red arrows. 

Personally I’d be happy with just a title card and a date telling me when the film will be out. We know the film is going to be about the origins of Han Solo, we know we are all going to see it regardless of what they put in the trailer so what is the point of the trailer potentially giving away spoilers? 

This isn’t aimed at trailers in general but Star Wars in particular. I don’t see the contents of a trailer being a deciding factor for whether we go to see the next film in the saga or not.

However, I'm slowly buying into this new movie. The preview and trailer looked really fun. And the more I got thinking about it, the more I realized that it's okay to have another Han actor as long as the movie is good. We need to stop looking at this next Han and picking all the reasons why he isn't Harrison Ford and start looking at this as a new take on the Han Solo character. If they can give us a fun story about Han's youth and his character is well acted, then why should we complain? I'll take more stories if that's what it takes.

If we expect Star Wars stories/movies to continue on for years to come then we have to come to grips with the fact that some of our favorite characters will have to be portrayed by different actors. It has worked for James Bond for years and people just accepted that each new Bond was a different take on the same character. It doesn't mean there aren't some underlying ""rules"" and similarities, but each actor will bring their own spin to him.

Anyways, I'm now excited about the movie and taking this new mindset has helped just sit back and enjoy the new content rather than worry about Han not being Harrison.

4518,"Dear Disney: Please tell new stories, and stop using nostalgia as a crutch","Honestly, The Last Jedi may have done irreparable harm to the franchise, but I think Star Wars' massive popularity, even after the Original Trilogy was released, is proof that fans are willing to accept new stories that don't rely on nostalgia as a crutch.

Look no further than Knight of the Old Republic; a story not only heralded by Star Wars fans, but video-game enthusiasts across the globe. Widely considered one of the best RPG's ever made, it managed to create an intensely compelling narrative, without *relying* on nostalgia (even if it certainly tapped into it).

I think many of us share a similar worry with the new ""Solo"" movie. We know who Han Solo is, and he didn't need an origin story. You're not going to make Han Solo any cooler, but you *do* run the very real risk of altering or ruining the character for fans.

I think Rogue One -- while it obviously ties very much into A New Hope -- is also a testament to fans embracing a new cast of characters (even if, let's face it, Vader totally steals the show at the end). I would even argue that Rogue One is the *future* of successful Star Wars movies, at least in tone (Rogue One certainly had its share of flaws).

Now, I'm not defending everything in the EU; we can all admit, some of it was garbage (like Boba Fett in a lightsaber duel with Vader). But some of it could *absolutely* be used to fuel new movies, such as Kyle Katarn's story, or -- again -- Knights of the Old Republic (if condensed, probably Taris -&gt; Dantooine/Korriban -&gt; Unknown Planet/Star Forge).

Or hell, just go totally outside estalished stories!

4532,Something about the actors in the SOLO movie,"I'm wondering if anyone feels the same way as I do. For one , I am sooooo hyped about this movie. I think we've got a great thing going with the stand alone films, they seem to have a bit of a different vibe then the Skywalker saga films. Rogue one was great and I think Solo will be as well. 

Here's where I think i'm going to have an issue. Solo was 29 for the battle of Yavin. How long before the original films is this supposed to take place? I'm having a hard time accepting the people playing the new roles because of how different they look from their counterparts in other movies. They can't be much younger then 18-20 at most? Han and Lando don't look that much younger than the original actors, but they do look very very different. also who knows how many character cameos we're going to have where we run into the same issue.(FYI Chewie looks perfect for his age...)  What i'm trying to say is i don't buy that the characters would look this different given the little amount of time that would have been in between. I for one don't look that different then i did at 20 (now 28)

I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell because i'm saying something ""negative"" about a star wars film, but is anyone else feeling a certain type of way about the characters? FYI i still am super excited about the movie and think everything else looks great... will be seeing it on opening day for sure. 

TLDR: super hyped for solo movie , but not sure how i feel about the people playing the roles due to different looks / time period. ",StarWars,1517847434,fooboojoo,14,11,True,2018-02-05

Solo is the PERFECT excuse to use this B level character which fan's adore in another way.  Obviously we don't know the plot of Solo yet but it wouldn't be far fetched to have Fett involved in the secondary plot.  A tangential character/plot that explains their familiarity.  Fett doesn't need to be holding a grudge in Empire because of the events of Solo.  Han and Chewie just need to know who Boba Fett is and know he isn't to be messed with.

4569,What's with all the negativity?,"I understand the vitriolic reactions to George Lucas going back and editing his movies. I know the prequels got a lot of hate for bad dialogue and writing (I think II is the worst offender of this, and the Obi-Wan v Anakin fight scene in III) but despite the cringe they were good movies and I enjoyed them, at least I enjoyed I and III. TPM the most hate which I don't understand.

When Force Awakens came out I enjoyed it but it felt kind of lackluster, I felt like J.J. Abrams rehashed A New Hope and a lot of people agreed. But I was still excited that Star Wars was back.

Then Rogue One came out and it was awesome, I just recently saw the Last Jedi and I cried, I loved it, and I'm excited about the new Solo movie, but all I see online is hate. It seems like everyone hated The Last Jedi and I don't understand why, because they didn't explain everything and it was feminist? I'm also seeing nothing but hate for the Solo movie and it isn't even out yet!

He shouldn't really be Han that we know from the other movies. We should se a different, younger, more vulnerable character who becomes the Han that we know.

""Han is Han. He should act like Han Solo""

4613,"Got some serious ""Rush"" vibes from the Solo trailer","Did anyone else see some awesome parallels between Rush and Solo?

In case you haven’t seen Rush, you should go watch it now to get an idea of the action style that Ron is capable of. It's a dramatization of one of the greatest Formula 1 seasons of all time--James Hunt and Niki Lauda’s 1976 championship battle. Before the movie was released, there was a lot of skepticism from F1 fans about F1-movies, myself definitely included. But Ron did an awesome job in conveying what F1 fans love about their sport while also being approachable for people who hadn’t a clue what F1 was all about, and he did it all with equally great character development and action sequences.

In the past, F1’s influence on George Lucas (he’s a big fan) has manifested itself explicitly (pod racing), and at times more subtly--I always saw a connection between Niki’s dramatic crash, physical transformation, and comeback as one of the greatest drivers of all time as inspiration for the Anakin to Vader transformation (moreso the badassness and the helmet, less so the dead younglings). 

Watching the Solo trailer today, I got a lot of the same vibes from my first time watching Rush, and saw some great parallels between the movies: the exotic atmosphere, the adrenaline pumping beat in the score, and characters--the comparison of Solo and James Hunt seems very apt!

Maybe it’s too soon to say, but Ron has showed in the past that he can come from the outside to a subject and do it justice by the fans. If he takes a similar approach to the Solo movie, I think he can crush it!

As [HelloGreedo said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUgxKct9Fs), it's the attitude of Han that they need to nail. Not the voice or the look. Han's line at the end sells it for me. 

""I thought we were in trouble there for a second, but it's fine - we're fine"" as he's visibly sweaty and nervous. 

It just like Han saying ""Don't worry, she'll hold together.......... come on baby hold together""

4639,[Spoilers] It's OK to dislike The Last Jedi.,"It's pretty well established that this is the most divisive Star Wars movie yet, however every discussion I've had or seen seems to involve those who enjoyed it dismissing others for having bad critiques or not understanding the movie.

Leaving out minor nitpicks* I have several issues with this movie which I think are fair.

* **The Humour.** I'm not against comedy in Star Wars, Force Awakens had a ton of comedy and I loved that. A lot of Last Jedi's just doesn't land for me, the worst culprit is the Poe/Hux bit at the beginning it felt way too long and forced to me.

* **The Tone.** This kind of links in with the humour, The story overall was a pretty dark one filled with the good characters making terrible mistakes and many people suffering and even dying as a result. And yet the quips come thick and fast, many times to the detriment of the scene by not allowing the breathing room needed for serious moments.

* **The Day Trip.** I hated this whole sub plot, it wasn't that they failed in their mission, the movie is about failure. everything Finn and Rose did could have been cut and it wouldn't have any impact on the story, maybe you need to add one line to explain tracking the transports.** They could have stayed on the ship and been with Poe working against Holdo the whole time. Also the CGI horses were terrible.

* **Neo Skywalker.** I feel like this scene would have had much more impact if Luke appeared to be barely trying to evade, just side stepping, maybe not even igniting his lightsaber, this would have added to the Skywalker legend he was trying to bring back and the cocky teasing of Kylo like the shoulder brush. The Flips and Limbo skills were an odd choice for old Luke and were poorley executed effects wise.

* **That Leia Bit.** I have no issue with Leia having the force, it's hinted at in Empire and clearly stated in RotJ, this just looked bad, really bad. This might be the worse executed scene in all of 
Star Wars, the concept of Leia floating like a vampire in a B-Movie towards a victim is already ridiculous and it is not helped by the awful visual effects.

* **Lip-Sync.** Yoda looks the worst he ever has. The mouth does not appear to move in time with the speech at all, some lines it appears to be completely stationary, I'm glad it was a puppet and not CGI but this really distracted me. How did they get this right 37 years ago but this looks like a badly dubbed Kung Fu movie?

If you liked this movie that's fine, you're not wrong. Enjoyment is Subjective, I liked a lot of this movie but for me the above list weighs too heavily against the rest.

4650,[SPOILERS] TLJ - Headcount of the survivors,"The last time I watched The Last Jedi I took some notes. One of my goals was to gain an accurate headcount of the survivors.

Please note: I do not believe that we are meant to have an understanding of the actual number of survivors left in what used to be The Resistance.

The best group shot I could see is when they are grouped up in the hanger after Finn and Rose reunite with the group while Luke is outside. I did a very fast rough headcount and reached 17 before the camera shifted so I think there are 17-20 in that shot.

I took actual quick notes on the Millennium Falcon and these are the folks I could account for. Again, I doubt that this is meant to reflect everyone on board and it seems they want us to have an ambiguous number.

1 - BB-8  
2 - R2D2  
3 - Threepio  
4 - Rose  
5 - Finn  
6 - Poe  
7 - Rey  
8 - Chewbacca  
9 - Leia  
10 - Nien Nunb  
11 - Lieutenant Connix  
12 - Commander D'Acy  
13 - beard  
14 - woman brown hair  
15 - older man black hair  
16 - red head  
17 - short beard  
18 - black hair  
19 - brownshirt #1  
20 - brownshirt #2  
21 - brownshirt #3  
22 - Abednedo X-Wing pilot (C'ai Threnalli)  
23 - black hair girl X-Wing pilot  
24 - male X-Wing pilot

I would describe Yoda in the PT as serious yet nuturing. But Yoda in the OT (and also in TLJ) was more child-like and not very excited about his role in teaching another Jedi. I'm thinking about scenes like fighting with R2D2 over a flashlight, and arguing with ghost Obi-Wan about whether Luke was too old and reckless. Compare that to scenes of him teaching the Padawan children and giving Obi-Wan instructions for further training while in exile.

4681,On Holdo. From Leia: Princess of Alderaan to The Last Jedi,"There was one thing that for some reason stood out to me with Holdo. And yes, I fully recognize this is probably a case of overthinking it, but I kinda like what came out when thinking about it. 

Her dress. I actually thought of it as somewhat a nice connection to the ""Leia: Princess of Alderaan"" book. It was probably unintentional, yes, but it's no less intriguing. (this book is set before ANH, when both Holdo and Leia are teenagers learning about the Rebellion for the first time. Around 16 years old I think)

You see, Holdo is portrayed in the book as a very quirky and flamboyant character. Both in the way she dresses and the way she acts. She often has very colorful and flashy attires that are even described as overly saturated with color, and colors clashing with each other or something along those lines. Very colorful, very vibrant, very quirky. By the end of the book, it's revealed that she's like this in an attempt to distance herself from her planet's typical characteristics (their clothing being especially dull and grey normally, but it's implied this isn't just about fashion choices, but about personality as well). 

So, at the end of the book, Leia gives Holdo one last piece of advice that i think would've affected Holdo a lot in the coming years. I don't remember the exact line, but it was something along the lines of ""if you let them define what you are NOT, then you're still letting them define you"" and proceeded to encourage her to ""just be herself"".

The next time we see Holdo, she's wearing a colorful dress, but it's much simpler than anything she wore before. The color is still vibrant, but also more subdued, and it's no longer as flamboyant as it used to be. She's not trying to actively negate the style of her planet, but to accept who she is and what she likes.

This lesson, I believe, would have extended to more than just fashion choices, but her personality as well. Over the years, i'd imagine Leia's words would shape her into the calm, collected and confident woman that would briefly lead the Resistance in its most desperate hour.

(not that her quirky personality was in any way bad, I even found it endearing in the book. But given how her style was also very flashy and over the top, it's possible much of her attitude might have derived from the same desire to be the opposite of what her world was)

Then in The Last Jedi we see Holdo again. A woman who now has roughly 35 more years of experience and has seen many more things in her life. Yet it still feels to me like that lesson has affected her to this day. Her dress. Colorful and stands out a fair bit in a military situation. yet it's also simple and elegant. That's just who she is. She's no longer that quirky girls always saying strange stuff just to be strange, but a grown woman who knows who she is and where she's meant to be.",StarWars,1515218147,TheWhiteWolf28,5,26,True,2018-01-06

4683,[SPOILERS] About Rose’s line....,"I’ve been thinking about Rose’s line and its implications in the universe or even just the last jedi itself. She says “its not about destroying what you hate, but saving what you love” not a direct qoute but something a long the lines of it, which is a good sentiment in terms of bringing people back to the light, such as Anakin. 

But does the movie agree with it? 

Finn was trying to do the exact same thing that the purple hair lady did (I forgot her name). It wasn’t saving what she loved that freed the resistance, but destroying the first orders fleet. In that she did save what she loved, but she needed to destroy to achieve it.

4684,The nature of using the force (Spoilers for TLJ),"The discussion around Rey and her seemingly advanced force abilities in TFA and TLJ have lead me to think about the nature of force abilities. Rey uses some advanced techniques, and many seem to think that her use of those techniques is unearned.

Even setting aside some of the stated reasons (the light rising to meet the dark, etc.), I think it raises some questions about what dictates someone’s strength in “using” the force.

When Rey describes the force as a power, Luke says that she is wrong. It’s not a power. It’s the tension between things. The connection. 

In ANH, when Luke asks Obi Wan about the force he replies that it partially controls you, and also obeys your commands. But it still partially controls you.

In ESB, when Luke tries to lift the X-Wing. Yoda tells him “Try not. Do or do not, There is no try.” When he fails, and Yoda succeeds, Luke says “I don’t believe it.” Yoda responds “that is why you fail.” Not because of a lack of hard work or time, but belief.

I seems to me that belief and mental fortitude play a major role in the ability to connect to the force. The force is omnipresent, and would exist even without the Jedi, according to Luke. It seems to be something that is tapped into. They are force-users, after all, not force-exerters or force-creators. 

Time can help someone build their belief in something, and through time someone can build mental fortitude through discipline, practice, and meditation. 

But some people (like Rey) believe more quickly than others, for good or ill. She takes Finns word that she’s in the Resistance, she believes Luke, then Kylo, then Luke again, no question, and most importantly she believes that she can do things with the force that she has heard in stories. She just doesn’t doubt it. Rey also grew up in difficult, almost solitary conditions, likely building a great deal of mental fortitude.

A final, incomplete thought. The Dark Side: the quick and easy path. It is defined by hubris. An excessive belief in self. Maybe this is why the dark side often seems to be more powerful, and why it is “quick and easy”. It also might be why Kylo Ren seeing himself as failing to live up to his potential might be a vicious cycle. His low self esteem (especially in moments of conflict) hold him back, while he thrives when he is resolved and confident.

TLDR; the ability to “use” the force might not be about skill or practice, but about belief and mental fortitude. 

I’m still working on this idea, so I’d love to hear thoughts with supporting (or contradicting) evidence.

Also, This post borrows quite a bit from ideas that I’ve read from other redditors, but I can’t find the posts I read them in otherwise I would cite them.  If I find them I’ll edit to cite them.

4694,Last Jedi fan theory: The Real Reason Luke Left and Why His Character Changed,"Why did Luke change so much since we saw him in ROTJ? How did a devout Jedi knight become an anti-Jedi hermit? I think there is an answer, hinted at in TLJ, and it concerns what happened to Luke after his academy was destroyed, but before he arrived on Ahch-To. I think before TFA, Luke took a journey studying Jedi history, and the truths he uncovered on that journey changed him into the man we see in TLJ.

It’s pretty safe to assume that Luke didn’t really abandon the Jedi immediately after Ben's betrayal. In TFA, Han says Luke went looking for the first Jedi temple. If Luke really just wanted to hide and die, he could go almost anywhere, so why go to the trouble of finding the temple? Because that's *not* the real reason he left. He really left to seek knowledge!

When he first tried to restart the Jedi, Luke was still fairly unfamiliar with the original order. He learned a little from Obi-Wan and Yoda, and picked up scattered knowledge while on his missions for the Alliance. Still, he used what little knowledge he had and began a training temple. After his failure with this academy, Luke wanted to study the Jedi in greater depth and learn how the old masters did things. This would allow him to re-start the Jedi order, correctly this time, or so he hoped. But when he studied Jedi history in depth, he was shocked at what he found. 

In ANH, Obi-Wan said the Jedi were “the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy,” but Luke saw this was only part of the story. The Jedi were also the ones who allowed the Sith to thrive right under their noses, who abandoned peacekeeping to become leaders in the Clone Wars, and who watched Palpatine acquire more and more power without trying to stop him until it was too late. Luke realized Obi-Wan kept all this from him, letting him exalt the Jedi in his mind so he would want to restore the order to its former “glory.”

Learning the Jedi’s history also showed Luke he was as bad as the old masters were. When he learned about the Jedi’s failure to foresee the rise of Sidious and Vader, he remembered his failure to foresee the rise of Snoke and Kylo Ren. When he learned of Mace Windu’s assassination attempt on Palpatine, he remembered his near-assassination of Ben Solo. And when he learned of the younglings whose masters failed to save them from Darth Vader, he remembered the students he failed to save from Kylo Ren. Luke realized he was as weak as the old Jedi, and this made him bitter toward himself and his old mentors. 

Rey's second lesson makes all this evident. In it, Luke describes the Jedi’s failure to stop “Darth Sidious.” Luke always referred to Sidious as “the Emperor” before, presumably because he didn’t know Palpatine’s Sith name. Why does he now call him “Sidious”? Because he’s been studying the history of the Jedi and thereby learned the name. He goes on to say “it was a Jedi master who trained, and was responsible for the creation of, Darth Vader.” Here he vilifies both Obi-Wan and Anakin, refusing even to call them by name. Lastly, he speaks bitterly of how he himself is now a legend, idolized by those who don't know about his failures. This all demonstrates that Luke grew to regard himself, his father, and the Jedi who trained him as false idols. So he stopped communicating with his mentors through the Force, as evidenced by Yoda telling Luke he's missed him when he appears at the tree. (After all, Luke must have had some good reason for not talking to Yoda during all that time alone.) This may also explain why Luke cut himself off from the Force completely: he didn't want Force ghosts communicating with him.

However, these revelations about the past all come from *recent* Jedi history, while the library on Ahch-To contains only *ancient* Jedi texts. So Luke couldn’t have learned this information from the books on Ahch-To. How, then, did he learn it? My guess is that Ahch-To was actually the last stop on a longer journey through historic Jedi sites. In the map revealed near the end of TFA, the route to Ahch-To is not shown as a straight line from point A to point B. Instead, there’s a winding path, with several points along the route brightly circled. You can see the map [here.](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgQAAAAJGM4NzFlNTI2LTllZDAtNGY2Yy05YWYxLTQyOTI2OTU0ZDEwNQ.jpg) These could perhaps be fueling stations, since Ahch-To is quite remote, but it’s more likely these are actually other Jedi sites Luke visited before finally reaching the first temple.

Luke must have planned to study the complete history of the Jedi, all the way back to the beginning, starting with the most recent sites and records (which would have been closer to the central galaxy). When he was disillusioned by what he found in the recent records, he pressed on, hoping to eventually uncover some insight that would vindicate the Jedi and show they were not always so flawed. If he could just find where along the line the Jedi went wrong, he could keep from repeating their mistakes and model his new order on an older, purer group of Jedi. Instead, the longer he searched, the more apparent it became that the Jedi were always flawed.

When Luke finally landed on Ahch-To, he was at his final destination with one last chance to find answers. He must have traipsed up to the temple, briefly perused the ancient texts, and found it was all just more of the same. So he gave up and vowed he would never train another Jedi as long as he lived.

4701,"Thank You, Rian Johnson. [spoilers]","I'm going to keep this as short as possible, but I wanted to share my Last Jedi experience because I imagine there are others who might feel the same and might also be a little late the fray:

My interest in Star Wars really started with the release of the THX VHS box set. At some point during my childhood, I'd seen each of the three movies, but that release and subsequent Christmas gift was my first opportunity to watch them all in sequence. The expertly-timed special editions only piqued my interest further by demonstrating a new visual dimension to Lucas's world. By the time news about the prequels was starting to flow, I was a Star Wars Insider subscriber, an avid fan of Timothy Zahn's *Heir to the Empire* trilogy, and the owner of at least one replica lightsaber -- I was a fan.

I went to see *The Phantom Menace* with the girl who I would date for basically the rest of high school. It's honestly hard for me to remember much about that movie. Not only did it feel like a shallow exercise in further capitalizing an already bloated franchise, the movie lacked the handmade magic of the original trilogy. Add a cute girl to the mix, and Anakin, JarJar, and Amidala were basically reduced to white noise.

As for *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith* -- who knows? I know I saw them both, and I know I saw them both in the theater, but I'll be damned if I can remember the circumstances. I remember going to see Episode III by myself somewhat begrudgingly, and quite some time after its release. At the time, I was dating someone who simply wasn't interested. I remember telling her that I was seeing it mostly out of a sense of obligation, for a sense of completion, even though I already knew how the story ended. I also remember being barely able to sit through the movie, but not because it was bad -- it was an improvement over the previous movie, which itself was a significant improvement over the first. It was more that I just wasn't interested. 

Whatever that feeling was that I initially got from traveling to far-off worlds and watching lightsaber duels was simply gone. ""This is kids' stuff,"" I thought. ""And I've simply outgrown it."" Mostly, I just knew that whatever indescribable magic Lucas and company had captured with films IV-VI was simply not coming back. That had been evident for years.

The announcement of Episode VII found me skeptical. The trailer was good, or at least the film didn't look to be muddled with pointless, lifeless CG and annoying side characters, but my prequel cynicism won out. ""I'll see it,"" I said. ""But I doubt it's going to be good. And there's no way it will be like the originals."" I was right about one of those things: the movie was fine, not great, but fun and a nostalgia trip, and because that was all I expected, Episode VII was a strikingly more positive experience than the prequels had been. 

The most encouraging point for me was that JJ was willing to kill off a major franchise character in a fairly dramatic way. I also liked the new characters and the actors portraying them. I thought Boyega, Ridley, and Isaac turned in some of the first ever *good* acting performances in a non-Ep V Star Wars film, which was refreshing.

For a few days after my first watch, there was certainly a period where I found myself wondering, ""What's coming next..."" But it still didn't have that same feeling, that ""I want to be on the front lines of the Rebellion."" feeling, that ""I wish I had a lightsaber."" feeling. A few months later, I'd mostly forgotten the film.

Coming into this episode cycle, my interest for Star Wars was at an all-time low. I still haven't watched the trailer for the movie and I just got around to seeing the film itself for the first time today. I took my girlfriend, who had never seen a Star Wars movie before today when we watched Episodes VII &amp; VIII back-to-back. ""They're not great movies, you know?"" I remember telling her a few days ago. ""But they're fun and they remind me of my childhood."" 

The title of this post is, ""Thank You, Rian Johnson."" So by now, I should probably be getting to the question of just what am I thanking Rian Johnson for? I'm not going to sit here and tell you The Last Jedi is a flawless movie. For instance, the scene where Leia floats in space for a solid minute before tractor beaming herself back into the ship was a bit silly, and the subplot featuring Benicio Del Toro's character felt awfully superfluous. However, in the moment, I not only found those points of criticism easy to ignore, I found myself able to watch the movie without my critical antenna at attention. Suspension of disbelief was possible. I found myself caring more about the struggles of the characters than my feelings about where this movie would fit amongst the others in the franchise. In many ways, I almost forgot I was watching a Star Wars movie, and I mean that in the best way possible.

For the first time since the original trilogy, I felt like I was watching a movie that was not made simply to be the next cog in the Lucasfilm machine, but rather an artful, dense character study that dealt with the human condition in a complex way and allowed me to have emotional access to the movie's content. And that's mostly because of Rian Johnson's wonderful directing. 

It's clear that Johnson wanted to shake things up here, and the change is welcome. By demythologizing Luke Skywalker and demystifying the Force, Johnson puts the emphasis on the characters and their actions and emotions. This made for so many gratifying moments, from Kylo Ren and Rey teaming up to take down Snoke to Rose sacrificing herself to save Finn to Skywalker's sacrifice for the Resistance. I found myself *wanting* to be in Skywalker's position, facing down my nemesis in defense of my cause. I *wanted* to be Rose, laying it all on line for my friend and comrade. I *wanted* to be Rey or Kylo Ren, cutting the head off of the snake and carving up Imperial Guard with my lightsaber.

By doing away with empty fan service and going back to the root magic of Star Wars, the human drama of it, Johnson drew me back to a world I hadn't cared about in decades, back to characters I'd left behind, back to a feeling I thought I'd never feel again. Even more so than Episode V, this is a film that I feel is not just a good Star Wars film, but a good film, period. Its comments on generational dynamics, war-time ethics, responsibility, failure, and resilience are poignant and interesting, but its true magic in how it dismantles the plastic sheen of the Lucasfilm legacy to bring the viewer back to the emotional core of the Star Wars franchise.

Now, before you say that I'm a hypocrite because I made a post here a few days ago saying that I hate the positive circle jerking about this film despite liking it, I first need to clarify that this post isn't me just blindly praising the movie like an idiotic fanboy.

There's been so much shit-tossing on this sub about what makes TLJ ""the Star Wars movie for the braindead"" and frankly, it's utterly tiring and appalling. I've heard it so fucking much by this point that the only ""braindead"" people here are the ones parroting this drivel. 

All media is subjective. That's just a fact some people need to get around. I believe that people are completely free to like something even when it has clear, glaring flaws. Hell, I cannot for the **LIFE** of me figure out why some people like the prequels so much, but hey, I don't go around calling people idiots just because I disagree with them.

The exact same should apply for these sequels that Disney are pumping out.

Now, I have read, watched and listened to interviews, podcasts, opinions and reviews on why people don't like this movie. And there's some stuff I can certainly understand, while others are just purely meaningless nitpicks that don't mean anything significant. But again, I would like to disclaim that _there is nothing wrong with disliking something._ If you don't like this movie, that's a bummer. If you do like it, that's awesome, dude!

4708,Character Arcs in The Last Jedi,"I've seen The Last Jedi three times now and I've liked it more each time. The movie isn't perfect, but how Rian Johnson manages each of the main characters deserves praise. If you look at where each character started the movie and where they ended up and how they got there, it's remarkable. All of them experienced significant and defining growth. 

Kylo

This one is easy. Everyone loved Kylo in this movie even the people who didn't like the movie it seems. He had lots of emotionally challenging moments, the best line in the movie ""please"" and superb acting by Adam Driver. He grows in the movie from a humiliated apprentice into a conflicted/powerful villain. 

Rey

I was disappointed in Rey's arc at first, but it's grown on me quite a bit. She starts the movie looking for her place in the story, her parents, her heritage and why she has this power inside her. 

What she realizes (in the cave and with Kylo in the throne room) is that she must choose her path and that belonging is something you must make for yourself rather than just fall into. She embraces this by choosing a side and fighting for the rebellion. By the end of the movie, Rey comes to terms with the fact she's a nobody that's fighting for everybody to contrast with Kylo (the Skywalker who fights for nobody but himself). It sets up the contrast between them brilliantly for the final film.

Finn

Finn starts the movie wanting nothing to do with the rebellion and is all about self-preservation. Through his journey with Rose, he grows into a rebel hero willing to sacrifice his life for the rebel cause. I loved that post not too long ago about the significance of 'rebel scum.' What a great line. You may not like *how* he got there, but it's still relevant and incisive character development. Finn has learned to embrace his role as a member of the resistance for good, inspired by the tenacity and determination of Rose. He's ready to live up to his title of ""resistance hero"" going forward.

Poe

I like Poe's arc a lot in The Last Jedi. He starts out as a trigger-happy-all-in-wannabe-hero and is taught throughout by Holdo and then Leia that the best course of action is often the non-heroic way. To survive instead of fight and become ""the spark that lights the fire that will burn The First Order down."" At the end on Crait, Poe has learned his lesson and calls off the attack to preserve what few resistance fighters they have left.

They're grooming Poe to become the next leader of the resistance. Would not surprise me to have him be in charge at the start of episode 9 once Leia inevitably passes. He's grown wiser and stronger from the events in TLJ and would now make a great leader.

Luke

Alright, here we go. I love what they did with Luke in TLJ. I confess to not being the biggest Luke fan in the OT. He always struck me as being too earnest and largely boring as a result. But here, they bring him way down to earth and I love it. 

Luke suddenly feels human and relatable - failed as a Jedi master, lost his nephew that his sister trusted him with and became bitter and disillusioned as a result. Luke was never the legend the stories cast him as, and he knows it and chooses to hide rather than expose that. Until the end. Until he realizes that while the galaxy won't know the truth, he can still be the legendary Luke Skywalker to provide a spark of hope as his final act.

Choosing to force project rather than actually show up in person is crucial in maintaining this image and becoming the spark of hope in the galaxy to inspire others to rise up on behalf of the light. His talk with Yoda is so great in showing how he has to let go of his past mistakes, let go of the Jedi Order, and in fact go one step further and let go of his material form to embrace the Force and believe in its power to bring balance to the galaxy.

So those are the arcs, and there's one last thing that ties them all together. The theme of the movie: Failure. And how each of the characters deals with their failures and failings as characters and grows from it.

Kylo's failure to live up to Darth Vader pushes him to take a different path resulting in the elimination of Snoke and his rise as supreme leader. Rey's failure in being mired in the past causing her to be imbalanced is rectified when she chooses to fight for the light over Kylo. She chooses her family so to speak. 

Finn's failure of courage at first is slowly overcome by being shown the injustices of the world by Rose and that there is something worth fighting for. And Poe's failure to see the bigger picture is overcome by the end of the movie as he leads the resistance to safety.

It all sets up so well for the final act. We have these characters that had to go through these growing pains in the middle act and now we have them all ready for the end-game. There are ways to improve how the characters got there, but just looking at the raw character arcs, it's great and each of the characters is now a stronger, better version of themselves after the events of The Last Jedi.

4718,[Spoiler] Some thoughts on Snoke (that I did not see yet),"[ ](/s ""ABSTRACT
Snoke is a group of force users who linked themselves to become more powerful than any singular force user before them. The supreme leader was just their face.


INTRODUCTION
Many of the theories I have found on how Snoke may have survived or will reappear in IX are based on the assumption that he either was a projection or will bring himself back from the dead.

But based on the fact that Luke died from projecting himself through the galaxy and that Snoke was cut in half, I find the former most unlikely. Plagueis' bring-people-back-from-the-dead stuff will also most likely not appear,  sadly.

FACTS
What if he did both; die and live?
Snoke and the guards are not the only ones in his throne room. Two cloaked hooded creatures with glowing eyes are working on his telescope. They disappear as soon as the fight following the regicide starts.

Snoke is multiple times more powerful than other force users, we have seen so far. He seems to be even more powerful than Sidious was. So either he has multiple times the power...

CLAIM
...or Snoke is multiple. This would explain why he could not see Kylo's intentions, why he claims to be unkillable or unbetrayable and why he is so dangerous to other force users: Snoke is not a single person, he is multiple. No one knows about the ones behind the face, so they cannot be killed. These may be the hooded figures. The force users may not be particularly powerful but know enough about the force to cloak their existence. It has already been established that Snoke can link multiple force users, so maybe he did that himself. No one can read snokes mind because this convolution is too alien for other force users. No one can defend against him because no one knows what to defend against.

If this is true, Snoke may even have been already dead. A corpse used as a puppet to give the group a face. They could even stitch it back together to give us a Franken-Snoke in episode IX. I would like to see an embalming ceremony..."")",StarWars,1515240458,MatthisRemz,6,0,True,2018-01-06

4720,[SPOILERS] An Analysis of the true Winners in Star Wars: The Weapon Dealers.,"Long post incoming guys/girls. You have been warned :)

WORLD BACKGROUND

We have all seen it. The First Order struggling for supremacy and the Resistance desperately clinging to prevent their extintion. 
And they score very big &amp; decisive hits against the First Order by taking out their Planet Base, their Space MegaBomber and so on.

THE PROFITEERING WAR-MONGER WEAPON DEALERS

But who benefits truly from these conflicts? As we find out in TLJ they are the Weapon Dealers who live out the blessed life the super-rich casino-world of Canto Bight, profiting from selling weapons to both sides while the rest of the universe burns away.

MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EMPIRE &amp; FIRST ORDER

As we find out in TLJ, the First Order relies a lot on the Weapon Dealers and various contractors to build their impressive arsenal.

This is a far cry from the Empire's stance as they built their own Star Destroyers (at Kuat Drive yards), build their own TIE fighters (at Lothal and other places) and finally build their own Death Star (at Scarif).

WHY THE G.EMPIRE/FIRST ORDER DOCTRINES DIFFER SO MUCH

We all know that the Rebels won the Great Galactic War, especially after the Battle of Jakku, the last battle of the war.
The result of this was that the Imperial Remnant could no loger rely on their own factories (which were either destroyed or taken by the Rebels) and thus had to turn to the Weapon Dealers.

As for the Republict what we find from the official SW novels is that Chancellor Mon Mothma (despire giving financial support to the Rebels) she really despised war. So she kept the military funding to a bare minimum, abolished the Republic Army (each planet would have their own regional army) and so on. As such when the threat of the First Order grew, they too had to turn to the Weapon Dealers (because they didnt plan ahead).

ANALYSIS HOW THE WEAPON DEALERS RIG THE SYSTEM

In fact one can argue from the battle results how the Weapon Dealers supply bad weapons to both sides in a masterful effort to prolong the war. There is also another reason (Difference of Darth Sidious/Snoke leadership qualities) that we will delve further below.


SELLING FLAWED WEAPONS TO THE FIRST ORDER
Many First Order newest machines have various design flaws. This is done in purpose by the Weapon Dealers so the war is prolonged.

A. The Starkiller Base has a very big vulnerability (the Oscillator). All it takes is some codes to bypass the shields with explosives and a few barrages take down the whole planet base.
In comparison the Death Star had a vulnerability that the creator installed in secret, and they even protected the weakness with careful turret placements.

B. The new Space Mega-Bomber (TLJ, the Dreadnought) that destroys Rebel bases has to be protected by TIE fighters otherwise a single X-Wing can destroy its sole defenses (weapon turrets) with ease.

B. The new Capital Ships (Star Destroyers) have weapon turrets that can easily be destroyed at close range (TFA, by Dameron's TIE fighter) and they have a big problem at close quarters (Rebel tactics in TLJ, exposed either by X-Wings or Republic Capital Ships). Their weapon effectiveness is also debatable, as they COULDNT destroy a Republic Capital Ship even after firing for several hours.

C. Even Snoke's unique Spaceship (TLJ, the Supremacy) has close range problems as well (TLJ, again exposed by Rebel tactics).

D. The New TIE fighters have laser cannons, missiles (TFA, Dameron's account) yet they still destroyed by the hundreds by a handful of X-Wing Fighters (TFA, Starkiller Base battle). They also get destroyed by the dozens by now 30-year old Millenium Falcon (many protagonists claim it is a garbage, yet it still delivers). They also have various scanner problems (TFA, exposed in Jakku) where they had to rely on visual targetting alone.

It is important to note that the G.Empire wanted to replace the TIE fighters with the much more capable TIE interceptors (Ep.6), but after the fall it didnt happen. So the weapon dealers opt for the more flawed superiority aircraft to sell to the First Order.

E. Even the Heavy Walkers (TLJ, the AT-M6) have problems. The Rebels use very old ski speeders against the AT-M6 and they dont suffer big casualties. Debatable how powerful are their laser cannons as they needed the artillery laser to bring down the door.

By comparison the previous bigger AT-ATs could not be taken down with ground forces and they needed specialized air spaceships with cables to top them down. They were also instrumental in taking down the heavily shielded installations and  causing great damage to the fortified Rebel positions.

F. Also the Mini-Death Star Artillery Cannon (TLJ, Battering Ram Cannon) has various problems as well. It needs an enormous set-up time, it is immobile, it is vulnerable from various angles and all of that just to destroy a fortress door. The outcome would be surely very different if the Resistance had air or even ground superiority. It really is a very flawed weapon design.

My speculation it was a Starkiller Base Replacement Lens that had no use after the Base was kaput and was simply retrofitted as a cannon. In that case the Wpn Dealers struck a golden goose, selling several Replacement Lenses and overcharging the First Order.

G. Also debatable are the personal Stormtrooper armor. Even after all those years they still dont have toxin filtration, a clear sign that the Weapon Dealers sell flawed gear to the First Order.

F. Also the Stormtrooper weapons arent that good, if we compare them to Chewbacca's Bowcaster. How can a 30 year old weapon be that powerful?

SELLING FLAWED/EXPENSIVE WEAPONS TO THE RESISTANCE

At first sign, the Rebels dont have that many flawed weaponry. While they do have some big problems, they also have some good weapon systems. But it is obvious though that have far fewer weapon systems as well. Maybe they just dont have enough credit.

A. The Resistance Bombers (TLJ) have a major flawed design. They require a big setup up time, and they are essentially glass cannons as a stray TIE fighter hit can destroy the whole fleet in a chain reaction. The Resistance apparently knows how big death traps they are, as they only have 1 or 2 pilots.

B. The Republic Capital Ship (TLJ, the Reddus) has apparently top- of-the-art-shields as it can hold several First Order Star Destroyer shots for many hours. Maybe Leia is not as easily fooled or they paid too much credit for the good stuff. But apparently she can be fooled because the Reddus has a big weakness, the Bridge can be exposed even when its shields are up. Major design flaw there and it is what killed Admiral Ackbar and the rest of the Rebel leaders.

C. Apparently the new X-Wing doesnt have any glaring flaws. Furthermore it exposed many design flaws of the First Order's vehicles/spaceships/weapon turrets. Perhaps its main problem is that it is too costly and as such the Resistance can only have few of the effective spaceships. They might be too damn expensive!

D. Gone are the area personnel shields of the Rebels (ep.4-6, something that even the primitive Gungans had in abundance)

F. Also gone are the days of powerful anti-air Rebel weapons. Leia probably longs for an Ion Cannon (Hoth Rebel Base, ep.5) that forced the G.Empire to commit to a ground force). Maybe they just dont have that much credit anymore.

G. Similar point about the Resistance blasters. Apparently Chewbacca's Bowcaster, a 30-year old weapon is more powerful.

WHY THE FIRST ORDER IS WINNING DESPITE THE MEDDLING

It just seems that the Resistance doesnt have enough credit. As the Slicer DJ puts it plainly: the First Order pays better (TLJ).

Another point is that the First Order also has some weapon designs that developed themselves. Most notably the Hyperspace Tracking, a weapon technology that the G.Empire tried to develop for several years (as discovered by Jyn Erso in Rogue One).

LASTLY, FIRST ORDER vs. GALACTIC EMPIRE LEADER DOCTRINE

No one can argue that the Emperor is much more politically-active leader &amp; more paranoid than War Leader Snoke. He frequently pulls vast treacheries and complex schemes on a daily basis.

However his choice of underlings also shows a keen tactical mind. Grand Moff Tarkin is a most brilliant strategist (examples in SW Clone Wars), Grand Admiral Thrawn (Rebels) is probably the one of the Galaxy's most brilliant strategists and even Director Krennic is a somewhat capable leader (Galen Erso even says himself that without him they would have eventually achieved the Death Star plan in a much slower pace. But they would get there eventually).

Perhaps the threat of Darth Vader killing inept officers also serves a survival-of-the-fittest reality. We also know that Darth Vader was a very good general in his Jedi days (Clone Wars series).

On the other hand Supreme Leader Snoke seems much more interested in the Force. Perhaps that is so because the First Order is already dominating the Galaxy. 

However Snoke's underlings reveals us a lot about his tactics.
We find in TLJ that Snoke keeps underlings that are easily controlled no matter the quality of their skills. General Hux (especially Hux) and Captain Phasma make far too many mistakes, but they dont get punished/demoted/killed even when they fail miserably.

Perhaps that is also Kylo Ren's fault. He really is an unstable individual that regularly takes his anger at machinery and he is certainly not a good war commander. He also constantly seeks the advice of his mentor Snoke. Perhaps we will see a better Kylo in ep.9

TLDR/OUTCOME

The Resistance has various problems as well. Despite that they try to do their best through some unique individuals, despite having put themselves in a bad position. After the Empire fell, they did hold most of the bargaining cards, but they lost them spectacularly (mostly through extremely bad political maneuvers).
You obviously have to make lots of mistakes to go from the New Republic to the measly Resistance.

The First Order also has very big leadership problems. Despite that (vastly because the New Rebublic has comitted self-suicide) they apparently hold the advantage despite multiple failures.

The Weapon Dealers really influence much of the First Order/Resistance war. They either sell deliberately flawed weapon designs or they overcharge their buyers. Or they even do both.
As such they live the good life counting their zillion credits.

As such they are the true winners of the 2nd Great Galactic War.

Think about what Luke knows about Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. He slaughtered the Jedi. He destroyed Alderaan. Vader sold Han to Boba Fett in exchange for the opportunity to attempt to capture or kill Luke. When father and son finally met, Vader chopped of Luke’s hand. 

And yet, Luke holds out hope that his father can be turned back to the light. And he is able to actually do it! Wow!

Now consider the relationship between Luke and Ben. Ben is Luke’s nephew, born in a period of relative peace. It’s likely Luke was there when Ben was born, and was a big part of his young life. Luke has memories of Ben as a perfect, innocent child. Luke spent time training Ben in the ways of the Jedi. But he saw some things that made it look like Ben might turn to the dark side, so he decides to go and try to kill his nephew in his sleep? COME ON, MAN!

I just can’t get on board with that right now. Episode IX had better do a real good job of explaining what happened to Luke to change him from the courageous, eternal optimist who faced down the ultimate evil and turned it back to good, to the biggest coward in the galaxy who tried to kill his nephew in his sleep.

4731,[TLJ SPOILERS] A Theory On Rey And The Force,"Please be warned that there will be spoilers to The Last Jedi in this thread and if you haven't seen the movie yet but still plan to do, then please, do not read any further.


I have seen people express the criticism that Rey without explanation was strong in the Force and was able to lift rocks with seemingly little to no training. I personally heavily disagree that there is no explanation as to where her power comes from and I'd like to share my views on the matter to hopefully clarify this point of criticism at Star Wars The Last Jedi.

To begin, I personally believe people have a misconception of what the Force in the Star Wars universe is and how it works. People often see the Force to be two sides of a whole, the Light and the Dark. When viewed faction-wise like in Star Wars The Old Republic, the original trilogy, the prequels or the newest sequels, this would be correct from a certain point of view. We have the Republic and Jedi, followers of the Light, battling the Empire and the Sith, followers of the Dark, in SWTOR. In the original movies it's the Rebel Alliance vs the Galactic Empire. In the Prequels, Republic vs Separatists. In the newest sequels, Resistance vs First Order. I am not surprised that people therefore see the Force as having two sides as well because the initial view would indeed say it is so. However, this view is actually wrong. The Force is a cosmic divine entity that binds all life together, it connects and holds the entire galaxy in Star Wars in one piece. It is present within everyone and everything, some being more attuned to it than others, those people being able to draw upon the Force and use it like the Jedi did. Before I continue, it is important to note that this is the state of the Force as it is supposed to be, the Force being used selflessly, like the Jedi did. In this way, there is balance.

Then we enter the different state of the Force, the unnatural one, where those who were able to use the Force stopped using it selflessly and instead start using the Force selfishly. That, using the Force for your own gain through the use of selfish emotions, is what the Dark Side is. The Dark Side is referenced to be a different aspect of the Force, but it in fact is a corrupted version of it, corrupted by being selfish and using selfish emotions. It is why those who use the Dark Side so often seem to be addicted to the Dark Side, corrupted and slowly being destroyed by it. Using the corrupted version of the Force is like using a drug, which slowly is killing you and makes you more addicted to it the more you use it. Yet it is important to understand that this is not a natural part of the Force, it is rather unnatural and a perversion of it.

This brings us to the point of balance and the true meaning of it. As Luke said in the Last Jedi, the Force didn't belong to the Jedi Order. Instead it belongs to everyone and everything in the universe, binding and connecting it all. It is why the number of Jedi in the galaxy is of no consequence in the Star Wars universe, it merely is a representation of the Force within the galaxy. However, the number of people that do use the Dark Side of the Force is of the utmost importance. Why? Because those who use the Force selfishly and corrupt it are the ones creating the imbalance in the Force itself, because they pervert and corrupt its true state and form. Thus whenever someone arises that starts using the Force selfishly, thus in other terms, starts using the Dark Side of the Force, it is the natural response of the Force to correct this and restore balance. In this case, balance doesn't mean an equal amount of Light Side users and Dark Side users as people often mistakenly claim, but instead it means the total eradication of all those who use the Dark Side of the Force.

And how does the Force do this? Because it permeates everything and everyone, the Force manipulates the entire galaxy to correct this imbalance, depending on the scale of the imbalance. In the case of one Jedi who turned to the Dark Side, the response of the Force will be smaller. In the case of an entire faction arising led by or consisting of Dark Side users, the Force will manipulate the entire galaxy into a devastating war if need be, just to eradicate the imbalance that was created. This is the very reason why there is constant warfare in the Star Wars universe, it is why the Light and the Dark are constantly at war with one another. It is the natural instinct of the Light Side, meaning the state of the Force as it is supposed to be, to destroy the Dark Side, meaning those who use the Force selfishly and through it, corrupt it.

This is perfectly explained by Kreia in Knights of the Old Republic II:
&gt; ""It is said that the Force has a will, it has a destiny for us all. I wield it, but it uses us all, and that is abhorrent to me. Because I hate the Force. I hate that it seems to have a will, that it would control us to achieve some measure of balance, when countless lives are lost."" - Darth Traya 

Let us return to the examples I used to depict why people mistakenly view the Force as having two sides and implement what I just wrote in a simplified manner for now, for the ease of explaining it. In Star Wars The Old Republic the Republic backed by the Jedi and Empire led by the Sith are at war with one another because the Force demands that the Republic and the Jedi, followers of the Force in the state it's supposed to be in (the Light Side), destroy the Empire and the Sith who have corrupted and perverted it. In the original movies the Rebellion, followers of the Light, rise up against the Galactic Empire, who are led by two followers of the Dark Side, because the Force demands that balance is restored. In the prequels, even though we know that Palpatine was the orchestrator of the Clone Wars, the Force nonetheless could be seen as making countermoves through Padme, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, the Petition of 2000 and so on as manipulating the galaxy to rise up against the darkness that Palpatine was casting upon it and the Force. In the newest sequels its the Resistance that is being manipulated by the Force to rise up against the First Order which is led by Snoke up until the Last Jedi and subsequently Kylo Ren, both Dark Side users perverting the Force by using it selfishly.

The wars in Star Wars and the conflicts between the Light and Dark almost seem cyclical and they actually are confirmed to be cyclical by the Visual Dictionary for Star Wars The Last Jedi in Luke's chapter:
&gt; ""Skywalker's studies revealed the cyclical nature of the struggle between light and dark, and the massive toll the galaxy pays with each cycle."" - [The Last Jedi Visual Dictionary](https://imgur.com/a/VABke)

It is important to note however that the Force isn't manipulating for example the Republic and Jedi to battle against the entire Sith Empire, but rather, it manipulates everyone and everything in as well the Republic and Jedi as the Sith Empire to end those who use the Dark Side, which in this incarnation of the conflict happen to be the Sith, the Lords of the Sith, the Darths, the Lords of the Dark Council and the Sith Emperor himself. The Force isn't seeking to remove the Sith Empire itself, but those that use the Dark Side and thus in other words are corrupting the Force. This is important to understand, because it shows that the factions in Star Wars never mattered, or at least, in the eyes of the Force. It is why for example the entire spacebattle going on in Return of the Jedi is less significant than the battle that is going inside the Death Star II between Vader, Luke and the Emperor, while logically speaking the spacebattle should have been more significant. The Rebellion is a means to an end to the Force in that moment, where they were manipulated to bring about the confrontation between Luke and Vader, subsequently Emperor Palplatine torturing Luke which brings back Vader to the Light, which has as consequence that the Emperor is destroyed and balance returns. The entire galaxy was manipulated by the Force, the entire Galactic Civil War orchestrated by it, just to let that moment aboard the Death Star II where Vader was redeemed happen. It explains perfectly why Kreia despised the Force and why she sought to end it. Because the Force would manipulate everyone and everything in whatever way was necessary to bring about the destruction of those who used the Dark Side so that balance could be returned, balance meaning the complete lack of Dark Side users.

And this brings us to the point why Rey was as strong in the Force as she was in the Last Jedi. The Force itself is the answer and its tendency to manipulate everyone and everything to end those who use the Force selfishly and thus corrupt it. Rey was as strong in the Force as she was because the Force itself manipulated the midi-chlorians and her attunement to the Force to be as strong as she needed to be in order to be on par with Kylo Ren and Snoke, to be in turn capable of ending them and their corruption of the Force.

This is even confirmed in the movie by Snoke himself when he greets Rey when she is brought before him in his throneroom aboard the Supremacy:
&gt; ""Darkness rises and Light to meet it. [...] I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the Light would rise."" - Snoke in the Last Jedi 

Kreia's words on the Force show a deeper truth about it and how it works in the Star Wars universe. To reiterate, Kreia stated:
&gt; ""I hate that it seems to have a will, that it would control us to achieve some measure of balance, when countless lives are lost."" - Kreia in KOTOR II 

The part ""that it would control us to achieve some measure of balance"" is the most crucial truth about the Force that has been thus far expressed about it both in the new Canon and in Legends continuity, with the bit from the Last Jedi Visual dictionary about the cyclical nature of the conflict between the Light and Dark reaffirming this bit. The Force demands balance and it will not blink an eye whether it's a Republic, a Resistance, an Empire or First Order ruling the galaxy. As long as there are none that use the Dark Side of the Force, thus use the Force in a selfish manner, the Force itself would be fine with whatever flag is waving over the galaxy. The Force primarily cares about those that use the Force or are instrumental in the destruction of those who use the Dark Side. It is why the Force manipulated Rey to be as strong in the Force as she was, it is why the Force manipulated events in such a way that Finn was sent with Rose to Canto Bight in order to learn to fight for a greater good, it is why the Force manipulated the birth of Anakin Skywalker, it is why the Force manipulated an entire Galactic Civil War so that Vader and Luke would fight and the former be redeemed by the latter. The Force will manipulate the entire galaxy if needed so that a select few key individuals who are destined to bring about the balance of the Force will have the strength and possibility of achieving that.

Therefore, my conclusion as to why Rey was as strong in the Force as she was is the following: Kylo Ren and Snoke rose in power with the Dark Side, using it selfishly and thus corrupting and perverting the state of the Force it is supposed to be in, namely only Light Side and 0 Dark Side users. In order to return the balance to the galaxy and itself, the Force manipulated for Rey to be awakened to the Force, because it chose her to be destined to bring about the balance (and perhaps the reason why she was chosen and not another will be revealed in Episode IX). As Kylo Ren grew in strength, the response of the Force was to let Rey grow in strength as well, despite the fact she might not have had much training. It was the Force itself that was manipulting Rey to in effect teach herself and why she excelled at the Mind Trick in Episode 7 or why she lifted all those rocks so easily in Episode 8. The Force didn't care about Rey being untrained, it needed her to be strong in order to be able to escape from Starkiller Base, to find Luke, to learn about the Force and what her destiny is. It needed her to be able to save the remaining Resistance members from the mines at Crait so that they in turn might help Rey bring about the balance in the Force and the galaxy the Force itself demands there to be. If there was no First Order, no Snoke, no Kylo Ren, then Rey might not even have gained any stronger attunement or connection to the Force and remained on Jakku, because in such a case there would have been no imbalance and no need for Light Siders to arise to fight it.

And that is also the meaning of the boy with the broomstick at the end of the Last Jedi. The Force has not only manipulated the galaxy in such a way that Rey became stronger attuned to the Force, but it has awakened that same connection within dozens if not hundreds of others. As I said before, the amount of Jedi in the galaxy is of no importance when there is no imbalance, but when the Dark Side arises through those who use the Force in a selfish manner and thus corrupt it, then the Jedi need to arise, or another incarnation of Light Side followers and warriors, in order to battle the rising darkness. In SWTOR it's the Jedi Order and Republic, in the original movies it's the Rebellion and Luke, in the prequels it's the Senators such as Padme and Bail Organa and Jedi such as Obi-Wan and Yoda... and in the newest sequels it's the Resistance and Rey, with a new generation of Light Side users at her side.

Remember Kreia's words to the Exile, for those who say that it's impossible for Rey to be as strong as she was in the Force in the Last Jedi:
&gt; ""Nothing is impossible with the Force."" - Kreia in KOTOR II 

--------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR:** Rey is able to use mind tricks and such due to the fact the Force is manipulating her to be as strong as she is in order to be able to stand against Kylo. She is a tool being used by the Force itself to eliminate all Dark Side users from the galaxy in order to return the balance to the Force. The fact that the Force is in balance when there are no Dark Siders in the galaxy has been both confirmed by canon as well as legends material. The conflict between Light and Dark is of a cyclical nature as stated by the Last Jedi visual dictionary. That means that the Dark Side rises and the Light rises in tandem to meet it, literally as Snoke said in the movie. It is something no one but the Force itself has control over, this including Rey's aptitude and strength in the Force. The only reason she is as strong and seemingly trained as she is, is because the Force itself wills her to be such. 

&gt; ""I fear nothing, [...] All is as the Force wills it."" - Chirrut Îmwe in Rogue One 

Had Kylo Ren remained Ben Solo and not fallen to the Dark Side, had Snoke never risen to power or existed after the fall of Palpatine and the Empire, then Rey would never have been as strong as she was in TFA and TLJ because there would be no reason for the Force to intervene as there would be no Dark Siders disturbing the balance in the galaxy and the Force. Very likely Rey would have had some strength in the Force and perhaps she would have been discovered by Luke during his travels and trained under him, just like normal Jedi did in the past. The situation would have been normal then. However, this is not the case, Snoke may not be around anymore but Kylo and the Knights of Ren are very much around and followers of the Dark Side. As long as they exist and corrupt the Force by using it selfishly, then the Force will manipulate the entire galaxy in order to correct this imbalance. It will awaken connections to the Force in people who previously had no attunement to it, it will give strength and aptitude in others like with Rey, it will manipulate an entire faction to arise in war to battle the Dark Side users. That is why Rey is so strong and skilled in using the Force, the Force is manipulating her insticts and if you think about it, when a Jedi dies their essence becomes one with the Force. That means the Force is saturated with the experiences of thousands upon thousands of Jedi, therefore the Force being able to plant those experiences within Rey's mind and subconcious, enabling her to use the Force on an instinctual level rather than being trained to use it.

I'd love to get feedback on A: Does it violate any of the current official cannon?, and B: does it make sense logically to you? (Warning, it's lengthy)

At the end of E6, the Rebels take out the Emperor. This throws the galaxy into confusion. Rebel forces move into Coruscant and declare the New Republic, but they are too few in number to effectively occupy the entire breadth of the Old Republic/Empire. While the manage to establish a firm grip on all of the major core worlds near Coruscant, the rest of the galaxy breaks apart into a variety of political units. A whole host of successor States of the Empire arise. Some encompass entire Sectors while others are limited to a single System.

Meanwhile, most Imperial fleets are still intact but leaderless. Some surrender to the New Republic. Some dissolve into infighting. Others pledge allegiance to one of the many imperial successor States. And a few simply disappear from the records.

For the first couple years, things are very chaotic. However, the New Republic has a lot of legitimacy (many of its leaders are well know throughout the galaxy, and it has the support of the sole remaining Jedi master) and it is the most powerful single political unit. While it could have been overwhelmed had the imperial successor States been unified, they spent most of their time fighting each other during that period. Because of this, the New Republic is able to steadily expand its region of control in the years following its founding, and after about a decade, it comfortably controls about 2/3s of what the Old Republic used to control. One thing to note here which will be important later … the New Republic doesn’t have a fixed Capital. They move it from System to System, to avoid any one place becoming to rich and powerful. (IE Coruscant is no longer the Capital).

However, this is when things start to go wrong. First off, Luke drops off the map (which we know about due to to E8). Second, the New Republic really is a republic, and over time, loyalties and opinions change. Leia and company are voted out of office, and a pacifist government takes over. Kinda makes sense … the galaxy has been at war for decades and people want a return to peace. Plus the New Republic has been winning steadily for over a decade, and it appears that nothing in the galaxy poses any real threat. There are still a handful of polities outside of the New Republic which claim to be the official Empire, but they are all small and weak, and they are prone to infighting. 

Unfortunately, unknown to the New Republic, it is around this time that one of the small successor States, which calls itself the First Order, gets taken over by a force user called Snoke. Not only is he very powerful with the Dark Side, he also very smart and wealthy. Under his leadership, the First Order first becomes the most powerful of the successor States, and then one by one, conquers and incorporates all of them.

Naturally, something like this can’t be kept entirely secret. However, when news of it reaches the New Republic, it falls on deaf ears. The pacifist government doesn’t want to hear about anything that might disturb the peace, since its hold on power is based on that peace. To the contrary, it loudly and officially dismisses the news as false rumors and continues with planned budget cuts to the military.

Leia, frustrated, gives a speech decrying this policy, and attempts to rouse people to the threat. She is mostly unsuccessful, and in the end resigns from the Senate and drops out of public life. In semi-secret, she begins to try to build up an independent military force. She acquires some ships with the help of her remaining contacts in the Senate and the New Republic Navy, and others she flat out buys, using her own considerable wealth. However, she has to be careful, because the government of the New Republic considers her to be a nuisance and maybe even a possible threat.

Which brings us to the years immediately before Episode 7. Snoke has his Starkiller base, which can destroy planets through hyperspace. However, it’s not a god-weapon. It is limited in range to nearby Systems. So Snoke waits. As I mentioned earlier, the New Republic has a rotating Capital. Snoke simply waits until the Capital is moved to a System near the edge of the New Republic closest to him, and then launches his weapon. He decapitates the New Republic, and launches a blitzkrieg across the galaxy. In almost a mirror image of what happened to the Empire, the New Republic fleets fall into disarray. Not only are the leadless after the death of the entire Senate, they’ve been starved for resources for years. They quickly fall.

The only thing standing in Snoke’s way is Leia’s Resistance. (Which then is completely wiped out in Episode 8)

4742,A simple fix to one of the best and most controversial scene in TLJ,"Yes, it's the FTL strike scene. 
The fix? A quick shot of Hux yelling for Hyper space jammer and been told it's too late. 

The concept, the cinematography, and the execution of the scene was absolutely some of the greatest of not just star wars but cinema in general for the last decade. But beauty aside, I think no one would disagree that FTL strikes have such catastrophic power brings serious plot issues to the star wars universe. Why wouldn't people just load up unmanned attack ships with FTL drives to destroy every thing in their path? Granted that the cruseship in TLJ was huge, but from the presentation of the scene much smaller ships could still make considerable damage through FTL. The premise seems especially tempting sincee in the opening scene it was mentioned that an X-Wing have no chance penetrating star destroyer protection, and only near-suicide bombing runs could take down dreadnoughts. The question here is, if this method is so simple  and so destructive, why don't people use it all the time?
A fix would be to actually show us the difficulty of it. Show the audience that there exists simple countermeasures that could easily stop the FTL attack. Instead of showing us a scene of FO officers realizing they are been aimed at, show us them yelling for hyperspace lock or jammer and been told that won't activate in time. A simple explanation to why hyperspace attack is usually difficult with be more than enough to justify one of the most gorgeous scene in the entire movie.

But now after my second viewing I am certain he used the force to have the brook come to him before he imagines himself like a Jedi and staring up at the universe. 

Is this to indicate that new force users are popping up? The Jedi order is being destroyed and the past is being killed is the theme, so now a new beginning for the universe and for force users?

Or am I missing something and everyone in the universe can use the force whenever they want, but only Jedi/Sith have trained to become strong with it?

It really gave me hope that we will be seeing some more force users rather than just the couple jedi or sith here and there for future movie installments.

- Leia feels both light and some darkness when her son is still in her womb (some people thinks that he's manipulated by Snoke since then but I doubt it). So Ben Solo is born with some dark side in him.

- Han can't stay at one place so he doesn't take care of his son much, so does Leia who is too busy with the government. This leaves Ben Solo abandonment feeling, and becomes Snoke's target. He's manipulated by Snoke since young age. Notice that in The Force Awakens novel, Han forgives his son's action (as like in the movie he touches Kylo's face) and hope someday his son will forgive him in turn too, this shows Han regrets not being a good dad to help Ben during the years.

- Vader fate is hidden from Ben (Which I think Snoke surely used it to twist Ben's mind about his fate and so, ""I will finish what you started grandpa"")

- Luke's action finally marks Ben Solo's turn, he didn't turn until he's &gt;23

Characters like Kylo, Luke, Finn and Leia are very different from the public persona of their respective actors/actresses, but Daisy herself comes out a lot in her role. When you watch interviews of Ridley, it is hard to separate that it is not Rey. And in parts of TLJ like the first training scene, you can tell that she really has affinity with Mark Hamill.

Out of everything wrong with the sequel trilogy, the casting of Rey (and Kylo, Poe, the reprising characters and pretty much nobody else) is one of the things that went right.

How does the empire not see the evac ships? Cloaking doesnt make the ships invisible, only to radar. The empire saw the evac ships during the first fight but not when the ships are in the middle of space.

How does rey beat the elite guards? If kylo had problems, she would have been beaten immediately, especially considering their armor deflects lightsabers. 

How does rose turn around during the salt speeder scene to flee, but then turn around and still hit finn? Seems like her speeder was twice as fast as his.

How did they not see the millennium falcon fly off at the end? The rebels had to walk through a cave, so they couldnt have been far, so the empire should have seen them fly off.

If you go to 4:16 and look to Kylo's expression, you can assume that maybe he decided to let Rey win, maybe because he don't want to see Rey in Snoke's hands and make her suffer even more and I like the idea that he wanted to be defeated as a punishment for his recent crime. That can be one more reason of why Rey win the battle.

* Remorse for killed his own father

* Shot by the bowcaster

* He was not trying to kill Rey, but take her to Snoke or make her his apprentice

4783,For many people it isn't that the heroes are fighting the empire again but how they are fighting.,"This has become one of the many minor discussions that has popped up after TLJ though for some of us it has been a series of debate since TFA was released. 

I personally as a Legends fan have no problem with them fighting the empire again. In fact one of the things I hated about the NEU was that the Empire gave up in just a year after Endor (and according to Aftermath lost over 18000+ ships in one year and gave up Corsucant, the capital of the galaxy, without a fight).

While Empires End kind of fixed it with letting us know that it was part of the Emperors plan it seemed odd that every single imperial would follow it and their would be no defections or warlords or a imperial Remanent (Though again Empires End kind of fixed this by leaving that door open slightly). 

The NR not fighting them felt strange coming from the direction of a Legends fan. And at times during these debates people will bring that up, that in Legends the NR spent years fighting the Imperial Remanent. So why do we like it there and not in TFA/TLJ. 

And while I can only speak for myself its how it is represented.  In Legends the Rebels/NR fight for three years after Endor just to take Coruscant and shatter whats left of it by force. Two years later when Thrawn shows up (Five years post endor) The Empire has splintered into many different groups and the New Republic is able to meet them on mostly even grounds in most fights. 

Eight years later the real last hope of the empire is smashed by the New Republic and by 12 years after Endor the New Republic is the only super power in the Galaxy. And while the Empire is still technically around and *at war* with the New Republic for another three years (14 years after endor but really they aren't a threat to the New Republic after 8 years) they soon seek a peace agreement. 

So what makes that different than what we see in the movie? For most of it (say everything post the capture of Coruscant) the New Republic is the top dogs. Yes they are still weak enough that the empire is a threat but they are able to face them on more equal footing. And the Emprie now has to change as well. In the Thrawn triliogy we see hit and fade tatics, attacks on transports, psy ops. In the Thrawn dulogy we see Imperial agents trying to spread hate and riots, working with pirates, back stabbing. 

Both the empires and the New Republics roles had reversed in a way. Not enough that the New Republic was never in any danger from the empire. But enough that it was no longer just a small band of Rebels vs a stronger empire. Which is what many of us feel we got in the new movies. 

In the NEU the Empire folds in on its self a year after Endor and then heads off to the unkown regions to become the First Order. Because of this the New Republic decided to cut down on its military. That fleet we say in TFA? That was the NR's entire fleet according to the visual dictionaries. The NR gets 30 years of peace instead of having to fight off any imperial hold outs (because everyone decided to either fold a year after Yavin and sue for peace or go with the fleet to the Unkown Regions..)

And when we first meet the heroes again and see them fight it seems like we haven't moved forward. Instead of a large NR fleet having to deal with hit and run raids by the First Order or the Resistance just being a black ops while Leia tries to convince the NR fleet to fight the first order we are hurled back into the same weak rebels vs strong empire fight we had just left in the last triliogy. 

In the first movie we see the entire NR navy wiped out. Then in the second movie we see the entire Resistance except for 20 people destroyed. And those people are now calling their self a Rebellion against Kylo's new galactic empire which some how (I know they have the ships in the Battlefront II DLC but they don't say how they got them) has enough ships to take over every system in the Galaxy. 

At this point Starkiller base seems useless. If all the NR had was one small fleet and the FO has enough ships to easily take over all known systems then they could have just outnumbered the NR. Also it leaves us in a weird spot. We are going to have to have a large timeskip unless we want the 20 people to go from getting their but kicked to winning the war in a few months. 

But even if we do have a 3-5 year timeskip that just leaves us right back at ROTJ. We are right back to the FO/Empire being beaten and the new heroes having to rebuild the NR (Poe taking over for Leia) and the Jedi Order (Rey taking over for Luke). 

So it feels more like we have set the universe back to where we were in the last series just to see the same types of battles and end up in the same spot. 

And that is mine and others problems with it. It isn't that they are fighting the empire. Its that they are fighting the empire the same way they did in the last movie instead of having it be different. ",StarWars,1515269102,roninjedi,2,12,True,2018-01-06
4784,I was almost an Ewok!,"I don't know if anyone is interested in this at all, but i thought i would make a post about it anyway and see what people thought.
So, a little back story; from the age of three until i was 8 or so, i was enrolled in stage school, i went on to do quite a bit of modelling, stage plays, many many adverts and quite a few films and series for the BBC etc.
My headmistress and agent was actually June Collins, Phil Collins' (Genesis etc) mother and Naomi Campbell was actually a few years above me.

Being young, blue eyed and having long blonde hair, i would spend almost every day in London at various auditions. 
One day i got an audition in central London, my mother took me as she often chaperoned me to my jobs.
We weren't given many details but me, my brother, and a few others turned up to an office in central London.
One by one we went through the usual audition process, for young kids it's pretty standard and boring, they just chat to you really usually asking you what other work you might have done, they are really just trying to gauge your personality at this point and whether you fit their aesthetic agenda.

Anyway, a few days later i got a call back, along with my brother and another girl from my school. It was at Pinewood (somewhere i had been a couple of times before). When we got there, we were told we were there for a costume fitting, and that it was for the new film in the Star Wars series, which at the time was still called Revenge Of The Jedi. We spent the afternoon having our measurements taken etc and that was it.

Then about a week later, we were called back to Pinewood for the actual fitting, we were told that we were to play some new characters called Ewoks. 
So once again all three of us went along and we all tried on these Ewok costumes. I remember my bropther was much younger than me, and he actually cried when they put the mask / helmet on him, bless him. Then for the rest of the day we were shown around the studios, almost 40 years have passed so my memory is a little sketchy, but i do remember seeing a full size Millennium Falcon, and an X-wing in this massive studio / hanger thing.
I also remember trying on Darth Vader's helmet. I also asked to take home a piece of the fur that they used for the Ewok costumes, not for any kind of reason other than i liked that it was furry i think.

The other great thing that happened that day was as we were being shown around, we went past one of the little cinemas that they have at Pinewood which are used for 'test screenings' (if that is the correct word) - so the producer and director can check various cuts of whatever films they are working on.
We stood outside and the lady told us that they were testing a new Jim Henson film called The Dark Crystal. She quietly opened the doors and we went up some steps, i remember a few men sitting there, they kind of turned towards us and smiled and motioned that it was alright. We sat down on the steps and watched maybe ten minutes or so of The Dark Crystal.

After that, im not sure what happened. What i was told through my mother, who was told by my agent, was that they decided against using children for the Ewoks as they can only work for like 4 hours a day, and the insurance is a nightmare etc
I later read in one of the subsequent books that they felt children looked to in proportion, and that we just looked like, well, children in costumes, so they decided to use dwarfs and midgets instead as their limbs are less in proportion. I also don't know how kids would have done the stunts that were needed for the film.
At the end of the day it was probably a mixture of all of the above.

So there it is; i was almost an Ewok!

I know it's not exactly super exciting, but i have a few friends who loved this story when i first told them. I guess it's kinda cool, at the very least it's a great memory.
I was a fan of the films before the audition and me and my brother, and now are children, are all massive fans of the franchise.

If you have any questions, i will of course do my best to answer them, but i think i have written literally everything i can remember. But please feel free.

TLDR: I was almost an Ewok in Return Of The Jedi.


edit: I did include a photo of me at the costume fitting but is hasnt shown up, if anyone can help i would be most appreciative.

4820,"My interpretation of Poe, Leia, and Holdo in ""The Last Jedi""","I will preface this review by saying I love all Star Wars movies I see, regardless of their flaws, simply because it is more Star Wars. 

I enjoy the prequels despite their countless basic moviewriting flaws, because they expand the Star Wars universe IMMENSELY, so i could ignore the main drama and revel in new doors opened by Episodes 1-3. This is why I initially felt uneasy about TFA, I felt it failed to add enough to the universe by exactly mimicking a new hope. However ""The Last Jedi"" expanded on the changes it DID make, which makes me feel much better about TFA. 

Now on to the main bit... Poe Dameron. 
I. Love. Poe. Dameron. I don't know if i'm simply smitten with Oscar Isaac but I loved his character. I see a lot of hate about him and his relation to Leia and Holdo so I wanted to share my take on it, and why I liked it so much. 

Leia and Holdo are grooming Poe to be the next leader of the rebellion. It begins with Poe as a fierce, loyal commander. However the first scene is used to showcase his weakness, when a target is in site, he will do anything to bring it down. The first order must be stopped, and if he has a shot lined up on them, he wont think twice about taking it, even if it costs him his life. The entirety of ""The Last Jedi"" (IMO) is an explanation of how to be a leader, and how a great leader knows when to NOT fight, even if it seems like the best chance, because he or she sees something no one else does. The film is a bit heavy handed chastising him for it, but I believe Holdo and Leia are not just criticizing Poe, BUT EVERY HERO PREVIOUSLY IN STAR WARS. They all behave as Poe did, you gotta 1) save the princess. 2) blow the big bad gun up 3)if either of those requires reckless self endangerment, bombs away.  

This theme is echo'd when Finn refuses to pull out of his suicide mission. Finn is following the same heroic mentality Poe previously exhibited and Star Wars glorified. Despite his heart being in the right place, IMO his sacrifice would have saved no one. Both the Tech (expert on machinery) and the hot shot pilot (an expert at blowing things up) claim its pointless. This scene is to show the toxicity and problems that Poe and Finn's mindset can cause. (yes i know rose crashing her ship into him is a bit dumb but i still fucking cheered)

This bring me to Holdo, Leia, and Poe's relationship. Holdo is nothing but cold to Poe in person, always a thin lined mouth and no facial expression but contempt. Yet when Holdo is speaking to leia about him and says ""i like him"" her face is completely relaxed and smiling. Leia and Holdo are stern mothers to Poe, keeping a disciplined face scolding him, not because they are mad, but because they are raising him to take up the gauntlet of leadership. They deliberately give a tough time to Poe because not only do they know he can take it, they know he will be stronger for it. This is clear to me by the fact that Poe can admit his mistakes. After losing his mutiny, being completely emasculated in front of his comrades, what does Poe do? He takes it in his stride and immediately switches to the new plan, because its what's best for the rebellion.  Poe is a better person than nearly everyone else in the star wars universe because he can nearly immediately admit his flaws and mistakes. This is why Holdo and Leia are so hard on him, they expect the world from him and believe he will become a great leader. 

I have heard arguments that Holdo and Leia's actions completely devalue Poe and his heroic mentality but I disagree. For 95% of Holdo's screentime she is devaluing Poe, and the idea of noble self sacrifice. Then when there backs are against the wall, what does she do? To quote Poe, 'Blows some things up', literally using herself as a bulllet. To me this was a nod to Poe's value, she took a page out of his book, perhaps even influenced by Poe himself. They are teaching him the rebellion needs his fire, his self sacrifice, and his drive to destroy the first order; but also a more patient leader. The first option to strike isn't always the best. He was not ready to be the leader of the rebellion at the beginning of the movie. But at the end when he leads the rebellion out of the cave and looks to Leia to lead she says... ""follow him"" he becomes the leader of the Rebellion, and i got chills looking forward to the next movie to see what he will do in charge.

If the rebels assessed their situation, they should realize that they are completely outclassed in leadership and strategy.

Thrawn will wreck the Rebels. How? No clue. Just like I don't know HOW exactly a gm chess player will destroy me but I know they will.

They should also realize that they have a big advantage in small scale operations, where, minus Vader, they can do just about anything. Phoenix squad is op.

So the Rebels should have used their advantage to assassinate Thrawn. It's just so much VALUE. Very low cost, extremely high chance of success and immense benefits. Best decision they didn't make.

Instead of deleting the location of the rebel base, kill Thrawn. Instead of retrieving sentimental object, kill Thrawn. Instead of doing literally anything that would save &lt;1000 lives, kill Thrawn.

It didn’t feel like a grand enough event for Kylo when this is the first time he has seen him since in his mind Luke tried to kill him in his sleep, so I thought the writing and Adam’s delivery was odd. 

There was also some truly awful dialogue “When I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi”. I also hate the line about destroying Rey as it just devalues the rest of the movie’s progress in building up their rapport

4836,[Spoilers] “Balance” and it’s Possible Implications in the Star Wars universe,"“Powerful light, powerful darkness.”

This is one of the most important things Luke tells us about the Force in this movie, which really ties into the overall theme of the movie, which can be summed up in one word: Balance 

As a rehash, what Luke meant was that the stronger a person or group is with the light side, the stronger the dark side becomes. 

And we saw that the Jedi became very strong with the light over the course of 1,000 years, causing equally strong dark side users to appear.

In the course of this movie, it seems like the idea behind the Jedi has changed. Whereas the Jedi would preach only light side use, it seems that Luke’s method of teaching Force users has changed. 

If one is balanced, one side doesn’t grow stronger than the other side. This means both “sides” of the force remain the same, and its balance is only disrupted by those who decide to use only one “side” of the Force. 

Now, I’m of the opinion that there aren’t sides of the Force but rather that it’s the attitude, the approach to the Force that makes it the dark side.

If you use the Force for purely selfish and evil motives, the individual makes his Force use aligned with the dark side.

The Force is one singular cosmic entity, and does not choose sides. 

Its users, however, do choose sides.

Which I believe is exemplified in the three versions of the flashback. 

Where Luke is shown as a victim of Kylo. Then Kylo makes himself the victim. Then Luke tells the truth in which both are victims. 

Luke a victim of pride and legend, and Kylo a victim of a master who had failed him.

With that said, I think we could essentially see a future generation of Force users that use both sides of the Force, essentially removing “sides” of the Force, and it just being *the* Force. 

If taught well, these future users could be balanced and not preach or promote one “side” of the Force over another, and could very well bring true balance to the Force.

4838,Star Wars: The Clone Wars watch list,"###Introduction

The Clone Wars was a cartoon set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, which aired on Cartoon Network starting in 2008. The show had some amazing episodes and story arcs, which give the viewer great insight into the prequel era. It also contains some real clunkers which you should only watch for the sake of being able to say you did.

I've seen a number of lists which detail which episodes of The Clone Wars are worth watching, and which ones are skippable. However, I haven't seen any lists which include the ""Clone Wars Legacy"" content. I also disagree with the inclusion or exclusion of some arcs in many lists. So I've created what I hope to be the definitive Star Wars: The Clone Wars watchlist.

This list is more or less in chronological order, with a few exceptions:

* Episode 216 takes place at the very beginning of the timeline, despite being placed in season 2. The placement of this episode is mostly irrelevant, so I've left it where it is. If you want to watch the show in perfect chronological order, this should be the first thing you watch.
* Episode 301 takes place directly after the Clone Wars film, before season 1 begins. Just think of this one as a flashback and you'll be fine. However, if you want to strictly follow chronological order, you should watch this after the Clone Wars film, and before you start season 1.
* Episode 501 takes place directly before episode 514, despite being the first episode of the season. I've moved it accordingly.
* The *Darth Maul — Son of Dathomir* comic miniseries takes place about midway through the *Dark Disciple* novel.

Arcs or episodes marked with ""optional"" are content which I enjoyed or found interesting, but don't contribute much to the overall story of the show.

I've done my best to give the arcs names which do not spoil the events of the arc. I also wrote a short description of each arc, which is hidden in a spoiler tag in case you want to avoid reading it. These descriptions are mostly spoiler-free, but not entirely.

4848,Star Wars fandom overrates and overhypes everything,"Here's a list of everything in Star Wars that's completely overrated:

* Prequel trilogy. I don't care that you grew up watching it, so did I, it sucks. They're not good movies and they're not too intellectual for audiences. You 90's kids have to stop thinking everything in your childhood was awesome because it's not true. A lot of it sucked. The prequels are part of it that sucked.

* The EU/Legends. Sucks. It's such a mess that contradicts itself. Chewbacca dies by getting hit by a moon? That's so stupid. R5-D4? Was force sensitive? That's terrible. The entire thing was moronic and Disney wiping it away was probably the best thing they've done. 

* Thrawn. Also sucks. Dumb idiot blue skinned dude. General Veers would destroy him any day of the week. Heck, Captain Needa would destroy Thrawn. Dude's a fraud.

* Luke Skywalker. Awesome character. Really, he's awesome. But he's just a farm boy with no formal 
training. Why on Tatooine would Luke be the most powerful Jedi to ever life and why did you expect him to blow up a Star Destroyer with his mind? Yoda couldn't do that, why would Luke be able to? That's so stupid. 

* Rogue One. It's a mess of a film that contradicts aspects of the original trilogy. It's so bad. It has no emotion, no characters, and is so boring. But OOO cool action and things I know! Bail Organa! OOOO. Shut up, it's nothing but a big budget, glorified fan film. Gareth Edwards is a hack of a director. It's not a war movie, it's not gritty, it's medicine for those who suffer from insomnia.

* Saber staff/double bladed lightsabers. If you want Rey to have this I'm guessing you probably think Duel of the Fates is the greatest lightsaber battle of all time. It's not. It's not even a fight, it's a dance. Watch Singin' in the Rain if you want that kind of stuff. It's just a gimmicky blade that looks stupid and is completely impractical. Rey uses a staff to fight, not a spear. What you want is a lightsaber spear. If Rey uses a lightsaber staff it'd burn her hands off. IT MAKES NO SENSE.

* Reylo. He's an evil jerk. She's a sweet kid. He's abusive and murders people. She's kind and wants to save her friends. He literally tells Rey that she's nobody. He chooses the dark side over her when confronted with the option. Dude's a monster and he needs to die. It's why he's a great villain. 

* Boba Fett. Really cool costume design. No way he ever could have survived the Sarlaac Pit. He's dead. Deal with it. 

* Darth Revan. I actually know nothing about Revan but the way the fandom treats him I hate him. 

* Old Republic. Same as Revan. Every now and again I'll watch the trailers for it, same with 1313, and it looks really cool, but I'm sick of people talking about Old Republic being how all Star Wars should be with 10,000 lightsabers clashing and it being dark. No, Star Wars is a children's fantasy adventure series in space. Let it be that.

* Obi Wan stand alone. Why? He's an old hermit probably doing old hermit things in the desert. I don't want to watch his stupid self hatred episodes. I'd love to see Ewan as Obi Wan again but that's just too bad. Anything that happened in the movie would feel like a contradiction of the OT just like Rogue One does.

* The Clone Wars TV Show. It has some cool moments, sure, but stop telling me it fixes the prequels. All it does is make the prequels look worse. Yes, Anakin and Obi Wan's relationship in the show is way better here, but you're forgetting one thing: THATS NOT ANAKIN. The way Anakin behaves, sounds, and even looks like is nothing like how Anakin is in the movies. It's a completely different character, essentially. It's inconsistent and I don't buy it. Let's also not forget to mention how stupid it is that Obi Wan has a gf and that they brought back DARTH MAUL. He got sliced in half and fell into a big hole. He's dead. I liked this show when I was in middle school but it doesn't hold up for me. I wish Rebels had its storytelling ability, animation style, and guts, though. Star Wars Clone Wars was still the superior version of the two and I wish it was the one that was canon. Seriously, where the heck is Durge in the entire The Clone Wars series? Maybe I don't like the 2008 series for the same reason EU fans don't like the sequel trilogy, I'm just so used to (and really enjoyed) what existed already I don't get why they replaced it. It's an ok show. I don't hate it. Except for bringing Maul back. That really was just stupid.

I don't know, this is all I got for now. Argue with me I don't care. I just wanted to rant. Thanks for listening to me and thanks for the inevitable downvotes that are about to come.

Now onto TLJ when Rey is on the Jedi Temple island with Luke. She has been following him around the island for a few days while being ignored by Master Skywalker. The very first time she stops following him is on a hillside where she hears whispers. Those whispers lead her to the tree containing the Original Jedi Texts. The whispers happen for a good 20 seconds before fading into an abrupt audio effect that runs directly into Luke starting his first conversation with Rey inside the tree. (Incredible dialogue there btw). Tonight was my 5th viewing &amp; 4th time listening closely to the whisper audio. I cannot make it out. It sounds like it may be a reversal effect. Has anyone figured it out yet if that’s what it is (or) has anyone read anywhere if those whispers were in another language &amp; it means something close to “these are your next steps” or “you are on the right path” etc...",StarWars,1515298050,MeanoFranko,3,14,True,2018-01-06

4869,Some questions about how space works in TLJ. (spoiler),"No I’m not talking about the leia scene. 

Two things really bothered me about how TLJ treats space,
Firstly, while the first order is chasing the rebel cruiser, the shots they are firing have an arc to them. I wouldn’t assume laser shots could have an arc to them at all and on top of that, an arc would imply some influence of gravity. My only explanation is the first order shooting a tracking laser bolt, but wouldn’t it make more sense that there guns are simply targeted on the cruiser and shoot straight?
Secondly, in the opening scene bombing run, wouldn’t having bay doors on the bomber cause everything inside to be sucked out? On top of that, the bombs appear to drop due to gravity? Is it possible the dreadnaught could be a large enough object to have gravitational pull?

4871,"Needs to be said: Not liking the direction Rian Johnson went is a fine reason to not like the film, but it doesn’t make it a bad film.","Too many people are confusing their dislike, which is totally acceptable and valid (though i disagree with it), for the plot choices with reasoning as to why it was the a bad movie.  TLJ had a generally good script (with the exception of the duration of Canto Bight and maybe some individual lines of dialogue), great acting from every cast member even if their characters were disliked, great visuals, and it added a lot to the Star Wars Universe. Those are all facts, though the last point could be argued as a bad thing to people who wanted the same feel and ideologies as the OT. Regardless, however, the film wasn’t a bad movie, it just may have been not what people wanted, and it has flaws that are harder to look past for some people more than others, which is fine and it’s how a fandom works. I just can’t stand all the hate the cast and crew (including RJ) is getting for the movie when they all did a good job with making a good film, even if there were some missteps (which honestly should be expected in a movie that was so hyped up and is trying to add to a story idolised by the world).
Edit: Wow i don’t get the controversy with this post, but maybe if people would stop biting at each other’s necks and would be humble enough to acknowledge they may be wrong there would be room for a less toxic discussion. I know that is wasn’t an amazing film, but i also think that people should seperate the quality of it and their opinions. I may be wrong, i may not be.

4896,Question: After seeing Rogue One last night,"Hi guys, this question is probably too old!

My question is that Tarkin has been traditionally considered very calculative and that ""Escape? In this moment of triumph?"" was just a blip instead of character flaw. 

Yet what bothers me is that since in Rogue One it was very clear that the Rebels went to steal the plan, why is it that:

1. Nobody had a backup for the file they stole?
I know that the entire data warehouse is destroyed in the movie, but surely someone would have had the backup for such important plan? 

This would then get Tarkin to realise which port is actually the Death Star's Achilles' heel, and strengthen appropriately. 

Yet in Episode IV we learn that they do nothing about strengthening the Death Star apart from bickering with one another. I guess middle management rivalry clouds their judgment that they can't focus on what the Rebel is intending to do, but still. 

2. ""Well a consolidated location for important files is important so leaks are easier to discover/uncover, so it makes sense when Scarif is destroyed no backup would be discovered!""

I don't buy this as even with only one location, one officer seems surprised when Krennic asks him to source all transmission done by Erso,  meaning that the process in restoring/investigating data breach is a bit tedious anyway. So having it in one location or two would not make much of a difference in terms of efficiency, and leaks seem to be a surprise to everyone in the movie. 

If I bought this theory for a second, regardless, would not a calculative decorated leader like Tarkin swiftly do something about the Death Star anyway? 

3. Why only Erso the capable engineer to see such ""obvious"" flaws? 

We would see in the movie that Erso is treated nicely because he is the key engineer in the project, yet it seems like such structural weakness/flaw would be recognisable by his colleagues. At such high precision level, surely the intellectual gaps between the engineers are relatively small? I mean if Erso dies unexpectedly and the project is ongoing, and the knowledge gap is so big that nobody could figure out what is amiss, am I to believe they are just going to scrape the project?

Rogue One basically reveals all kinds of incompetency that would get any data-related manager/engineer fired ",StarWars,1512622421,patrickswayzemullet,8,1,True,2017-12-06

The BF is a Darth Vader fan.  As such, I was thinking of getting him an autographed photo for his memorabilia collection.   I’ve now come to learn that Vader was played by Prowse and voiced by Jones. 

Can’t afford a photo with both autographs.  Do I go James Earl Jones or Prowse?

Side note...I did bring up the Prowse/Jones dynamic with him (not hinting at a potential gift) and he concluded that without Jones’ voice Vader wouldn’t be the same.  

Only thing is Prowse signed photos are way more common and seemingly have higher value than Jones signed photos.

He loves Hans too but those are way out of my budget...

Thoughts? This touches on the larger concept of who really brought Vader to life...but in the situation which signed photo should I get?

4943,"How do jedi, sith, etc. actually cast Force powers?","Right now, I'm teaking a few rules for a SW rpg and, when I came to Force powers, I realized I have never heard or read any clear explanation about how jedi, sith etc. actually draw power from the Force. I looked in Wookieepedia, googled it and found nothing. To point out my question better, let me list a few (hopefully well known) magic system:

- Harry Potter: though never explicitly explained, it is clear that in Harry Potter magic can be used everywhere and with limitless effects. The only thing preventing a bad wizard from casting spells of immense power is his skill. Moreover, it was never mentioned that someone got tired from casting spells.

- Eragon: here magic can still be used everywhere, but every spell take its toll on the caster in the form of physical energy. Casting too many spells can actually knock out and even kill the caster. Moreover, skill is important to properly direct a spell, but not to make it more effective. A newbie can cast a spell as powerful as one from a master, but that spell will be likely out of control.

- Warcraft: the world is permeated with a (not uniform) grid of magical energy. Mages, warlocks and so on can use this accessible form of energy to weave their spells. A skillful caster can make the most out of this energy, but there is a cap, like in real science (for example, thermodynamics boundary). The field has somehow infinite energy and, once a spell drains everything from an area, energy flows from neighbouring area to ""fill the gap"". Something like a water pool. So, the only way to cast a more powerful spell is to draw energy from a larger area around the caster, thus putting a strain on his mind, much like when you are trying to pay attention to multiple things. Note, however, that casting a spell in itself it's not a tiring action.

4969,Realization I made while watching RoTJ,"I’m watching the older films in preparation of Ep VIII and I noticed something about Darth Vader’s character that I never realized before. 

In the scene when Luke succumbs to Palpatine’s temptation to strike him down, Vader immediately draws his saber to defend his master. At first I always assumed it to be a natural instinct to protect his sifu but given the “Sith” tendency to murder and betray their masters I realized the greater connections and meanings behind it. 

In Episode 3, Anakin defends Palpatine from being slain by Mace Windu. He defends him as a Jedi, saying that Palpatine must stand trial, and killing him would go against Jedi principles. However, by Episode IV once Vader has already switched sides, he implores Luke to join him and betray the Emperor to rule the galaxy as father and son. 

As Vader’s conflict resurges in RoTJ, his draw back to the light seems to manifest again and as Luke momentarily is seduced by the Dark side to kill the Emperor, Vader takes on the principles of his former Jedi self and protects the Emperor based on his unwillingness to kill, to use his weapon as a form of defense, rather than aggression. Had Vader truly had his light side driven out, he would have allowed his son to overtake the Emperor.

4977,How were Non-Force sensitives able to hold their own against Jedi in melee combat?,"So I recently started to rewatch the Clone Wars series as I just got caught up with watching Rebels. Something that I recently noticed that kind of bothered me, is how non-force sensitives are able to hold their own against a Jedi, or a Sith, in melee combat. I've read that many saber battles between Jedi are so fast that they cannot actually be seen. Jedi instinctively use the force to place their lightsaber where it needs to be rather than seeing their opponents attack and reacting accordingly. So, with how quick Jedi are in their duels, how is someone who is not force sensitive able to even compete? In fact, Jedi are *often* on equals or are event bested by these people. Some examples include

* Darth Maul vs Pre Vizsla

* Obi-Wan vs Pre Vizsla (Although most of that fight was in Obi's favor)

* Anakin vs Clovis (fist fight)

* Jedi vs Grevious

* Jedi vs Cad Bane

Those are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are plenty more examples. The only thing I can come up with is that when fighting a non force sensitive, a Jedi cannot use the force to predict where an opponent will strike, as their opponent is not as ""in tune"" with the force. I'm hoping that perhaps this phenomena has been explained in canon, but at this point I'm just generally curious as to how exactly these people aren't being beat in a matter of seconds.

4985,What happened to Count Dooku's body after the Battle of Coruscant?,"Ok, this one's going to be a doozy, so bear with me n this one.

I. In the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Anakin and Obi-Wan conduct a daring rescue of Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who is held aboard the CIS dreadnought Invisible Hand in the skies above Coruscant.

A. In the course of Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel with Count Dooku, Obi-Wan is knocked unconscious and Anakin is left alone with Palpatine and Dooku. Anakin disarms Dooku by severing his hands and is then convinced by Palpatine to execute Dooku. Dooku is beheaded after being disarmed. His decapitated body is left in the throne room of the CIS ship.

II. Anakin and Obi-Wan managed to crash-land half of the dreadnought on the surface of Coruscant and walk away with only minor injuries.

A. This concludes a very critical and nearly unprecedented hostage crisis in Republic history. An event of this magnitude could not likely go uninvestigated by either the Senate, Coruscant Security, Republic Intelligence, or the Jedi Council. Someone had to lose their job as a result of the Republic's head of state being almost successfully abducted and ransomed.

III. Presumably there is a thorough clean-up of all of the wreckage on Coruscant and in its atmosphere after the Republic's victory in battle. Dooku's decapitated body would have been in either half of the downed Invisible Hand.

A. If it was aboard tha half that safely crash-landed, an investigation crew searching for CIS survivors, information aboard the ship's computer, or salvage would no doubt have come across Dooku's headless, handless corpse.

B. A headless, handless corpse is a dead give-away that the person was disarmed and helpless when he died, unless someone wanted to take the hands for trophies.

C. If the Jedi Council had knowledge, either through a meticulous de-briefing of Skywalker or by virtue of coming across the body, that Anakin had savagely murdered a helpless captive, he would have been suspended pending a full investigation and stripped of his capacity to lead clone troopers as a Jedi general.

1. The council would be tipped off to the suspicious nature of the situation under which Anakin slew Count Dooku. His mentor was unconscious, and therefore unable to supervise him. The only other person in the room was a powerful politician who had become Chancellor out of nowhere 13 years prior.

2. The circumstances under which the Chancellor had wound up hostage aboard the cruiser would have to be rigorously scrutinized. The Chancellor is supposed to have the best security detail in the Republic, and he wound up getting captured on the most valuable world in the entire Republic.

3. The discovery of Count Dooku's body and its implications for Skywalker's actions aboard the Invisible Hand might have unravelled Palpatine's plot to use Anakin as a pawn in his schemes throughout the entire movie if the Council simply placed Anakin under arrest.

Given this line of reasoning and the potential consequences of discovering that the Jedi Order's rising superstar Chosen One murdered a defenseless prisoner, it's a non-trivial question what happened to Dooku's body.",StarWars,1512694677,Grixis_Battlemage,4,5,True,2017-12-07

4991,A Guide to Avoiding Spoilers [A spoiler-free post],"So as most of you probably know, a big event like a Star Wars movie coming out often means that Spoiler Trolls come out of the woodwork and try their hardest to ruin the movie for as many people as possible. Game of Thrones fans see it when a new season comes out. Harry Potter fans saw it whenever a new book came out. And we Star Wars fans see it whenever a new Star Wars movie comes out. 

I remember how angry I was when a troll spoiled The Force Awakens for me (in a comment thread about Cloud being in Smash Bros), so It's my hope here that I can give you some tips on how to avoid them, what with the premiere happening on the 9th and spoilers probably hitting the internet within a few hours of that. I hope this list helps all of you and doesn't make me look too paranoid. The simplest solution would be to just drop the internet entirely for a few days, but if you're like me and you use it a lot, this might be kinda difficult.

**ON REDDIT:**

* The first thing you should do is go into your preferences, go under **Messaging Options**, and click on **Control who can send me messages**. [Here's a direct link if you're lazy.](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked) Set it to ""Only Trusted Users"" and then hit the **save options** button. This should keep spoiler trolls from being able to PM you spoilers.

* Back on the preferences screen, it may also be good to go to the ""don't show me comments with a score less than"" box, and set it to a positive number like 2 or 3. My assumption is that any spoiler troll comments will usually get pretty instantly heavily downvoted, and this should automatically hide any that pop up in a thread that you're reading. 

* Unfollow subreddits like r/starwarsleaks. I love that subreddit, but I think it's safe to say they're going to be discussing spoilers with pretty high frequency once the premiere hits. 

* If you have a reddit app on your phone, turn off notifications for it so that someone can't respond to one of your comments with a spoiler and have it pop up on your phone's notification bar. 

* If you have a throwaway account that you don't use for anything, I'd even recommend logging out of your main one and going into that one, and just silently follow whatever non-SW related subreddits you still want to follow until you see the movie. This is if you want to avoid spoilers, but want to read conversations on other fandoms or politics or things like that. 

* You may also not want to comment on this thread. Doing so may lead to you being targeted by a spoiler troll, unless you follow the above step afterwards. It's up to you.

**AROUND THE INTERNET** 

* There is a Chrome extension called ""Unspoiler."" I can't vouch for how well it works, as I haven't tried it out yet, but it seems like it would help if you installed it then set it to block phrases like ""Star Wars,"" ""Luke,"" ""Leia,"" ""Finn,"" ""Skywalker,"" ""Rey,"" ""Kylo,"" ""Snoke is actually Jar-Jar,"" etc.

* Don't go into any comments section. On anything. Anywhere. Doesn't matter if it's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, or your favorite website for gonk droid erotica. Don't do it. If it's a streaming site like Twitch, hide the comments. Just assume that every comment section you come across has a spoiler troll in it. This assumption will probably be correct. Also don't trust the Unspoiler app to block it in this case, since a lot of trolls will probably make an image captioned with major spoilers and post it directly there.

* If you have friends on social media who are holes of the ass variety, I'd recommend muting them or something like that. If all of your friends are nice human beings, you may be safe.

**IRL**

Not a whole lot you can do here, but the fact is that there may be people like [these assclowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CciA2k2uuj0) who just show up to ruin everyone's fun. Just a couple things you can do, and I realize these may come across as a bit paranoid on my part:

* Maybe don't wear any Star Wars apparel before you see the movie. 

* When you see the movie, whether it's at a fan event or a normal showing, you may want to put in your headphones and listen to music until you get into the theater and the trailers are playing. This'll help you avoid both the actual jerks and people thoughtlessly discussing it on the way out from previous showings.

If anyone has any extra suggestions, feel free to comment with them and I'll add them if they meet my rigorously high standards ^/s for this post. 

I made this post because I remember just how *furious* I was when a spoiler troll spoiled me about TFA, and I want to help as many people as possible avoid that happening for this movie, especially considering how many big reveals it will probably have.

I remember just before Star Wars: Rogue One came out, that the ending was hypothesized, or hinted at, or even leaked, to be very, very different. I just don't remember the source.
