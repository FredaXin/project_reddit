8,"An idea about how ""Picard"" is going to start. [spoiler]","Mars is fucked.

I was at work thinking about how the new series will play out, and I started to notice a pattern, one I've noticed others on the subreddit also note: Mars

The Picard Countdown comic so far has shown us Utopia Planitia, which Geordi is in charge of, or at least in charge of the building of the rescue ships, and we know U.P. is in orbit of Mars. If the fleet is being built there, perhaps the refugees will be temporarily housed at Mars. And from my limited knowledge of the story in the comic, the rescue is going sideways pretty quickly. 

We know that the last Short Trek of the ""season"" is ""Children of Mars"" and meant to be a prologue/prequel to Picard. And in that simple five second promo we see [these girls](https://imgur.com/EtoZkoy). One bullies the other, one cries, and they hold hands. Not a lot is shown. Wild speculation—one cries and they connect and hold hands as [this](https://imgur.com/19Ij7Qy) happens.

In one of the trailers for ""Picard"", we see a quick glance at [Romulan(?) ships](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/picard-sdcctrail-034.jpg) flying toward a *red* planet. I think that's the same planet seen [here getting fucked](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/picard-20191220-trailer-00002.jpg). Which means the surface is getting pretty [war-torn](https://imgur.com/ORFEqrd). Those orbital shots make it look an awful lot like Mars. 

Also in those trailers we see glimpses of [ships and a station](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/picard-20191220-trailer-00007.jpg) in the middle of the fight. It was speculated that this is the ""Mars Defense"" thing that became Borg fodder in TNG. Also, [RIP the space station](https://imgur.com/TDf0WIi).

Picard leads Romulan refugees back to Mars for temporary settlement, but some, perhaps loyalists or Tal'Shiar decide to pull a Nero and attack. To bring it back to Short Treks, perhaps the human-looking girl is [Dahj](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/picard-sdcctrail-066.jpg) or perhaps related to her?

why isn't Janeway the Captain anymore?

Is the Doctor a human or an android?

why is Neelix a hologram?

However, what if a future Star Trek series focused on a ""type three"" civilization taking note of the Milky Way, one that controls many galaxies or even a significant part of the observable universe (assuming that they don't just immediately destroy our galaxy because they can do that)? Or, perhaps in a series set in the far future, the Federation has become a power on that caliber, interacting with many other cosmic scale superpowers (maybe in the time of Daniels in ENT or the Timeship Relativity?).

14,I hope the production team for Discovery and Picard are paying attention to The Mandalorian,"The Mandalorian is, on one word, a masterpiece. Fan service done right. 

It succeeds in so many ways that Discovery fell flat. 

I grew up on 90s trek. And I have really enjoyed Discovery being on the air. It's fun and exciting to have new Star Trek to discuss and enjoy. I'm over the moon excited for Picard. 

But, there are many lessons the production teams of both shows could learn from The Mandalorian. 

First: you don't need to ""reimagine"" everything. Boba Fett would look fine exactly as he was in the 80s, dropped into The Mandalorian. The tech from Star Wars is aged, like the weird double 2D layer targeting system. But, it's still there and it works. 

Second: fan service doesn't need to be in your face. Inserting Michael into the Spock family as this sibling we never knew from a character we knew very well was way over the top. The Mandalorian gave us stuff like the bar on Tatooine, that was executed so well. Something so familiar to fans, but someone new wouldn't look at that and feel it was out of place. They made it work. 

Third: know your setting. The Mandalorian takes place between episodes 6 and 7. And it fits. Why, oh why, did they *choose* to start a new show with spore drives, holodecks, uniforms, ship design, etc in the middle of a time we have seen. They could have made the show be 100 years post-Voyager and the only thing that would need to change is Spock's family ties. If they are stranded in the Beta quadrant or the future or both, hopefully they can break free of this in season 3. 

Fourth: honor the Canon. We knew very little about Boba Fett. The prequel movies tried to fill in some gaps. The Mandalorian explores this culture without rewriting everything around it. You can feel the respect they have for existing Canon in the show.  Discovery tried to do this and close all those loops on the season 2 finale, but it was so rushed and felt forced. 

I'm excited for Discovery and Picard. I don't mean this to come off that I don't like Discovery, I do. I just hope they can take these lessons and learn from others how to do better. After all, it wouldn't really be a Star Trek show without a weak start. I hope season 3 is where Discovery finds its groove. 

Watching The Mandalorian has been real fun. We don't need cliffhangers between each episode to be excited for the next (here I am waiting up until after 1am to watch the episode as soon as it dropped). It's nice having these self contained adventures along the way to the bigger plot. Please give us more of this kind of storytelling.",startrek,1577442278,quarl0w,106,1,True,2019-12-27

16,Nearly done re-watching all of Trek. What next?,"My daughter is 16 months old. Since she was born, we've spent many nap times with her in my arms and me watching Trek. As she's dropped naps but still likes to chill for a bit in the morning, she's watched quite a few of the later series with me and has loved Voyager.

We've been through them all, from TOS to DIS, including the animated series, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute. I've barely skipped an episode, too, with the exception of some truly awful ones. I've been reminded of how great TNG and DS9 were, how underappreciated Enterprise was, how much of Voyager was actually decent (even excellent), and how much I enjoyed DIS. I'm honestly going to miss it when the rewatch is over. In love sci-fi, generally, but this has totally reaffirmed that I'm a Trekkie at heart.

So what next? I'll save the movies for a little while and while I will rewatch them all again with my daughter, I'll wait a while before diving back in (though I am, admittedly, totally looking forward to it). She has her Star Trek Opposites book for now and I'll doubtless get her some other Trek-related things (suggestions are always welcome; UK-based). I guess I find another series to chip away at.

17,"Should I watch DS9 and VOY side-by-side, alternating episodes as they aired?","Bit of context: I'm currently watching TNG and DS9 this way, and it's... proving to be a bit of a drag, honestly. TNG at this point in the series -- while it has its bright spots -- isn't really as interesting as it used to be, whereas DS9 has really caught my attention -- I keep wanting to race ahead on the DS9 episodes because I can't get enough of it.

I was really excited to start on DS9 by the time I'd got to the part in TNG S6 where it started. I'm due to start VOY not long after TNG ends, and... man, I'm not feeling it. The prospect of starting just isn't exciting me in the same way. I get the feeling that I might just end up the same way I am now -- spending a lot of episodes looking forward to the end so I can get to my next DS9. I feel that does a disservice to whatever I'm watching.

That said, watching TNG and DS9 in tandem _has_ been a good experience in other ways -- seeing how the shows evolve in parallel. It's mainly just TNG's decline in quality that's putting me off.

Should I give it a go -- is DS9 going to be significantly enhanced by watching VOY alongside it? Or should I just watch DS9 on its own so I don't have to keep interrupting it -- to give it a chance on its own -- and watch VOY some other time?",startrek,1577458154,fennric,24,1,True,2019-12-27

19,Counselor Troi might be one of the most underrated Star Trek characters,"I thought I'd never say that but I truly believe it now. I've been spending time rewatching some season 3 and she continuously has good scenes as counselor and as Picard's advisor.

In Ensign's Command for example she has a revealing conversation with Picard about alien races and language that could very well have inspired the set up for Darmok.

&gt;**TROI**: In our dealings with other non-humanoid races there has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak.

&gt;**PICARD**: But we must have something in common. We communicate.

&gt;**TROI**: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, but theirs continues to elude us.

&gt;**PICARD**: Telepaths?

&gt;**TROI**: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien race communicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on a planet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine. (she hold up his cup of tea) S'smarith. What did I just say?

&gt;**PICARD**: Cup? Glass?

&gt;**TROI**: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. We conceptualise the universe in relatively the same way.

&gt;**PICARD**: Point taken.

&gt;**TROI**: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is five hundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They consider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexity to avoid any future misunderstandings.

&gt;**RIKER [OC]**: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonists on visual.

&gt;**PICARD**: On my way. So, it begins. 

A few episodes later she plays another pivotal role when a child's mother dies in the line of duty while serving aboard the Enterprise.

https://youtu.be/5SbvYqEzQ2E

Apologies for the weird frame rate in this video I found.

She has key, pivotal scenes as both advisor and counselor. You really have to admire her.

I truly feel like many of the shows writers did Deanna a disservice but that doesn't mean she doesn't have a lot of good moments. I used to hate her but love her on rewatches. I find her more compelling than, say, Geordi or Doc Crusher for instance. I'm sure that opinion isn't common but it's how I feel in the issue.

I remember Sisko wore it a few times under the jacket, but can't recall the specific episodes, I'm gonna have to to some rewatches...I kind of remember Picard taking off the jacket with the vest already on in First Contact and Insurrection. It just seems like it would be way too warm, but DS9 and the Enterprise probably had A/C...(But I've heard IRL the sets didn't...oof..)

So going with the vest under jacket did they wear a second combadge underneath or just transfer the one to the vest?

 Also how do the combadges stick to the uniforms? I'm assuming there is a magnetic backing sewn into the shirts for the badges to stick to, seeing how easily they are put on and taken off..but my headcanon is that the combadges emit tiny tractor beams that pull themselves against the wearer...",startrek,1577470892,Complacent_Operator,15,1,True,2019-12-27

24,Jadzia Dax is boring.,"In DS9, she always had loads of potential; Great personality and loads of fascinating symbiant-related plot material.

But, most ""Dax episodes"" aren't about Dax at all. They are either about something related to her, like symbiants, the Trill or Klingons. Even the episode which was about Dax having a forgotten psychopath host tormenting Jadzia, was a huge disappointment. Dax was unconscious through most of it while Sisko and Bashir solve the plot on their own.

What I'm saying is, Dax never had a chance to properly grow as a character. She didn't have enough character flaws, conflict or discovery of self. The final two seasons improved a bit with her and Worf's marriage but even that wasn't enough for me.

Not to mention how the whole symbiant thing seemed really confusing at times. One day Jadzia is her previous lives and the other she isn't. It seemed to be whatever was convenient to the plot.

But then with just 10 episodes maybe they could just show the first hour and try to extend the rest of the season as long as possible given its shorter season. But I guess its not much of a big deal of one extra week lol.

47,Strange Voyager DVD set?,"So I bought season 5 of voyager years ago and noticed immediately that it didn't match my season 1-4 box sets. But it also doesn't look like any of the common bootleg ones I've seen going on ebay or amazon - it has almost everything it should, and when I watched it the episode quality and bonus features all match up with the other box sets I have (even the actual discs themselves look identical). I just bought the remaining seasons yesterday to finish my collection, along with a new copy of season 5 because the differences irritated me haha. Was just wondering if anyone else has ever run across a similar set to this oddity, or has any idea what it might be? It even came plastic wrapped with the same cardstock info paper as the other sets. 

[HERE'S](https://imgur.com/a/kJIQIAG) an image gallery showing the differences between the proper expected season 5 and the odd looking one, with the proper season 4 thrown in for some comparisons.

And a list of the differences I've noticed to help identify:

Normal: plastic shell comes in 2 pieces, has episode list on the back, orange disc trays held together by tape, title printed on disc tray

Weird one: plastic shell is one solid piece that is slightly too large, no episode list, disc trays molded with hinges, title printed on plastic shell, image on front crooked and of lesser quality (all the text seems to be printed slightly worse, even on the info paper compared to season 4, but not bad enough that you'd immediately think it was a bootleg)

Anyway sorry if nobody else finds this interesting lol, but as a collector strange finds like this puzzle me and I've been wondering for ages if anyone else has ever run across these sets.

I know the continuity of cultures between the series isn’t always consistent but Star Trek VI was made 4 years after the start of TNG.

72,[voy] S01E11 State of Flux: In praise of good season one Voyager.,"I know it's hardly an original thought to lament the lost possibilities of Voyager, but it really is a crime. I remember watching SOF as it aired for the first time in my country, and I remember thinking Voyager was getting good after the first ten dire episodes of season one. 

It turns out Seska is a Cardassian spy, aboard a Marquis ship, stuck in the DQ with a shipful of Feds. So she starts making deals with the local hoodlums (how she thought she might get away with it more than once or twice is another matter) in order to get home in one piece. When confronted by The Chak and Janeway in sickbay, and with no other way out, she instantly becomes Cardassian.  This scene still sends shivers down my spine.

SESKA: I did it for you. I did it for this crew. We are alone here, at the mercy of any number of hostile aliens, because of the incomprehensible decision of a Federation Captain. A Federation Captain who destroyed our only chance to get home. Federation rules. Federation nobility. Federation compassion? Do you understand, if this had been a Cardassian ship, we would be home now. We must begin to forge alliances. To survive, we must have powerful friends. The Kazon-Nistrim were willing to be our protectors in return for some minor technology.
JANEWAY: Minor technology that could change the balance of power in this quadrant.
SESKA: Change it in our favour! That is all that matters at this point. Building a base of power in this quadrant. You are a fool, Captain, and you're a fool to follow her. I can't imagine how I ever loved you. Computer, command XJL.
(Seska beams out.)

And for me, Martha Hackett is the is just about the only good thing about the whole of season one. Not only her, but the Seska story could have run and run. I imagine her being unceremoniously dumped by Cullah, and having no choice but to return to voyager and live as an outcast somewhere in the dark depths of the ship carrying an unwanted child. Then, it would get really interesting once Seven showed up. The two of them bond over shared experience of being swiped away from their people by Janeway, and by season 4, the marquis (including Sudor), Seven, and Seska are hatching plans to mutiny - along with several SF crew members (including Tuvok). Season 5 would have Janeway languishing in the brig with Seven in command. Season six would feature Seven's struggle with her conscience, eventually leading her to reinstate Janeway as captain with herself as FO. Things will never be the same again. Chakotay dies, somehow. Season 7, they get home in episode one, and all kinds of shit happens when SF finds out exactly what the fuck has been going on.

Anyway, it's a great episode - a real diamond in the shit. So many good lines too;

Chakotay to Tuvoc: You were working for her. Seska was working for them. Was anyone on board that ship working for me?

Janeway: I don't like bullies, and I don't like threats, and I don't like you, Culluh.

SOF is worth a rewatch you know, if you are one of those people who never includes the first 2 seasons of any series in a viewing. If only for the final scene. I think it might have been the only time Chakotay evoked any kind of emotional response from me. Poor bastard - 2 spies on his ship, he is none the wiser, and he even ended up screwing one of them. Who turned out to be a Cardassian.

CHAKOTAY: Can I ask you to be honest with me, Lieutenant?
TUVOK: As a Vulcan, I am at all times honest, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: That's not exactly true. You lied to me when you passed yourself off as a Maquis to get on my crew.
TUVOK: I was honest to my own convictions within the defined parameters of my mission.
CHAKOTAY: You damned Vulcans and your defined parameters. That's easy for you.
TUVOK: On the contrary. The demands on a Vulcan's character are extraordinarily difficult. Do not mistake composure for ease. How may I be honest with you today?
CHAKOTAY: I'd just like to know, from someone else who pulled the wool over my eyes, was I particularly naive? Was I not paying enough attention? What the hell was it that let all you spies get by me?
TUVOK: Like all humans, you depend on feelings and instincts to guide you, and they invariably let you down. But particularly naive? No, Commander, and I've always considered your attention span to be adequate.
CHAKOTAY: Did you ever see anything about Seska that make you suspicious?
TUVOK: No. She quite expertly pulled the wool over my eyes as well.
CHAKOTAY: Well, that makes me feel a little better. Thanks.
TUVOK: Curious.
CHAKOTAY: What?
TUVOK: That my failure, added to your own, should improve your feelings.
CHAKOTAY: Misery loves company, Tuvok.

As the inhabitants of the prime planets had opened their initial dialogue with prime Voyager, all their recreations are using Starfleet uniforms.

89,My observations on characters eating the cuisine of other species,"* Picard, Jadzia Dax, Deanna Troi, Neelix, and to a lesser extent Worf, often try many different species' food, although as a kid, Worf did go through a phase of only wanting Klingon food.
* Kira mainly eats Bajoran food, although she occasionally eats human food. Never seen her eat any other species' food, though.
* Generally only Klingons seem to like Klingon food, but Neelix, Jadzia Dax, Dr. Bashir, and Melora (from that one episode of DS9) are exceptions.
* While not food exactly, everyone seems to drink alcohol from other species (just look at Romulan ale and Saurian brandy). Blood wine, however, seems to be strictly a Klingon thing.
* Rom eats human food sometimes but Quark finds it gross. Not sure about Nog. I've never seen a non-Ferengi eat Ferengi food.
* Only Cardassians seem to like their food.
* I don't recall seeing Suder or the Trois eating their native food. In fact, I'm not sure what Betazoid food is even like.
* Vulcans are somewhat prone to cross-species dining, although they typically still eat plain food regardless of planet of origin.",startrek,1577689111,OptimisticTrekkie,47,1,True,2019-12-30
90,"Getting into Star Trek for the first time, but having a little trouble getting through TOS. Need help figuring out which episodes are important!","Hi all. I recently downloaded the game Star Trek Online on a whim. I was really only looking for a game with interesting space battles but I found myself actually interested in the story! I had seen a couple of the movies - Wrath of Khan and the one with the whales - and a couple of TNG episodes and liked them, but I was young and it didn't click. Now it's clicked!

So I had the brilliant idea of watching all of Star Trek alongside playing the game, and of course I wanted to start at the beginning, but I'm six episodes in and it's just too dated for me to enjoy. I can tell it's very well made and I understand why people like it, but I keep falling asleep.

I enjoy when the show is at its most sci-fi. I like seeing how they keep the Enterprise running and how Kirk and the crew deal with situations on the bridge. My favorite episode so far is the one where they dealt with the alien Balok.

But I really didn't like Charlie X or the one where they go to the planet populated only by kids. It's just not my cup of tea. You don't really learn anything about the Enterprise or the Federation or any of the important species in the lore. 

So I was wondering if anyone would be up for suggesting episodes that are important to Star Trek's greater lore, or at the very least flesh out the central characters or the capabilities/workings of the Enterprise. For example, I'd be very interested in episodes where the Enterprise battles another ship or gives insight into Sulu's character, but I would not be interested in an episode where Kirk and company beam off the Enterprise in the first fifteen seconds and then spend the remainder of the episode on a planet populated exclusively by a tribe of muscular women.

I know there are episode guides that suggest the best episodes, and I'll definitely be referring to those, but I honestly wouldn't mind watching bad episodes as long as they advanced the greater Enterprise/Starfleet story. That's what I'm interested in - maybe someday I can double back and watch all the episodes I skipped!

95,Pitch a TNG/DS9 crossover film instead of Insurrection!,"I’ve always found the scope of Insurrection very small for a movie, especially given what was happening on TV at the same time. I know TNG was never a show about war, and Picard’s crew might not be at home in a war film, but the show always depicted the Enterprise as the flagship of the federation and its crew as the most important in Starfleet. They’re always called during big emergencies to sort things out, so I find it a little ridiculous that they’re chilling on that planet, shaving beards and dancing around while the rest of the federation is fighting (and losing) the Dominion War. I know they explain it, but wouldn’t it have been really cool to see what Picard’s crew was up to during such an important time, and to see the war on the big screen?

I’m very interested in hearing what people here can come up with with the premise of a TNG/DS9 crossover film set during DS9’s 7th season (as Insurrection is). Pitch an idea!

My dream version of ST9 probably involves the Enterprise being called to DS9 to be sent on a diplomatic mission somewhere in the galaxy that would give the federation an edge in the war. A local problem concerning Bajor/the wormhole needs to be solved simultaneously for this plan to work. Sisko, Kira and Worf go with the Enterprise because their experience in the war is necessary, while Riker, Crusher, Geordi and Data stay on the station. It would be cool to see Riker in charge of the station, exploring the shades of grey always hinted at with his character (pardon the reference to his worst episode ever :D). 

The villains of this plot could be Weyoun, Damar and somehow Dukat, since he didn’t have much to do in season 7. Data goes on a side quest to retrieve some information (from the Cardassian Intelligence Bureau maybe?) with Odo, Garak and Bashir- Data for hacking purposes, Garak for spy purposes, Bashir for Section 31 purposes, Odo for stealth infiltration. They could make an interesting group, and we’d get some follow up interactions between Data and Bashir, Data’s morals could be challenged because of the nature of the quest, Odo and Data can compare attitudes on trying to be human(oid). Beverly takes over for Bashir at the station and she needs to adapt to the desperate/dubious treatments she needs to administer in times of war. Meanwhile Geordi interacts with Miles and notices how different he is. 

Meanwhile, Kira gets to witness firsthand the optimistic ideals of a federation starship, and she clashes with Picard’s diplomatic measures because she feels he’s out of his depth, having seen the worst of the war up close. Sisko realises how much his principles have changed over the years on the station, and he and Picard are thematic opposites, lamenting the exploration days in very different ways. I think it’s important to know what the TNG crew felt during the war, since they’ve always been peaceful explorers. The solution is a cross between the two attitudes- Kira and Sisko’s idea leads to their victory, but only because of some goodwill Picard manages to stir up. I also think it would be awesome to see Sisko and Picard’s dynamic evolve from their last less than pleasant interactions.

Worf is grieving Jadzia, and he’s able to open up about it after seeing his old friends. He gets through it with Troi’s help. Somehow the two of them do something important that helps save the day, in a way that ties into Jadzia.

TL;DR- I think the biggest problem with the TNG movies is that they had so many new characters and convoluted plots that the development of the main cast and their relationships was sidelined every time, as was the philosophy and political intrigue of the show. I also think DS9’s premise would have made a kickass movie, so why not get the best of both worlds? (see what I did there)",startrek,1577723566,han_to_enterprise,14,1,True,2019-12-30
96,The difference between Star Trek and Star Wars fandoms,"As literally a life-long Star Trek fan since discovering the show as a kid in the early 70's and watching over-and-over on WPIX Channell 11 in NYC all those years, one of the things I've always admired is how Trek fans really seem to embrace concepts on the show like IDIC (Infinite Diversity/Infinite Combinations). This carries through with how Trek fans interact with each other. We might disagree over things, but it always remains respectful and open to contrasting opinions.

Contrast this with Star Wars and in particular the fan behaviors during the release of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.  Just based on the online commentary and opinion there is a toxicity level among the Star Wars fans that is frankly absent in Trek fandom.  The vitriol, bile and nastiness on display is so disappointing. The contingent of fans who just hate TLJ and TRS and slime anyone not of the same opinion with accusations of being ""Social Justice Warriors"" or ""not true fans"" or turning the discussion into political discourse is disturbing to say the least.

Yet, I can open a conversation with any Trek fan and make a statement (as an example) ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" was the weakest of the filmed Trek entries"" and a that fan more than likely would either ask why I thought that way or would explain why they liked it. It doesn't degenerate into ""I'm right/you're wrong"" binary, zero-sum arguing.

The Red Angel suit: Allows travel through time and space, can act as a plot-solving power source, and can RAISE THE DEAD.

Deflector dishes and Borg nanoprobes WISH they were so multi-purpose! The only things that compare in other series would be the Q Continuum and the Prophets, but even they were explicitly presented as being arbitrarily advanced to the point where their powers were indistinguishable from magic.

I have a lot of problems with the series and its writing and direction, but if it had started out as fantasy it might at least help one's suspension of disbelief. I feel like they wanted to go that way with the Klingons anyway and their new Warhammer 40K flavour.

121,"""State of Flux"" was arguably Voyager's biggest missed opportunity.","For better or worse, *Voyager* is my favorite series in the franchise, but that doesn't mean that I'm unaware of its flawed execution. We can all agree that the Kazon arc was over-played and messy, but one thing I never see anyone talk about is how much this episode wasted Seska's potential.

Let's look back a few episodes to ""Prime Factors."" The Maquis are obviously willing to break the rules to get home a little faster, and they find an unlikely ally in Starfleet's engineer poster boy, Joe Carey. Suddenly, we're shown that an officer who's been loyal to Janeway since the ship left spacedock is willing to break with her policy of following Federation directives.

So, what if the writers had committed to actually making Joe Carey the traitor instead of Seska? What if Carey just wanted to keep himself as safe as possible so he could get home to see his family again? What if Seska *really did* go over to the Kazon ship to prove that she wasn't the traitor, just to accidentally out herself as a Cardassian on a ship full of former Maquis?

Think about the dramatic implications of this. Nevermind turning Carey into a recurring villain, they'd probably just kill him off. Focus on what Seska now brings to the table. Suddenly, this woman that B'Elanna, Chakotay, and all the other Maquis all knew and trusted for years is shown to be everything they all hate and fought against. Now, ironically, the only people Seska can trust to treat her fairly are the Starfleet officers on board.

This would have been a far more bold direction than what we got, and considering that Martha Hackett played the hell out of the role as it was written, I'm sure it would have been amazing to watch. Such a shame it didn't work out that way.",startrek,1577763642,PresidentMagikarp,9,1,True,2019-12-30

I have no recollection of this episode.  I don't remember watching it when it first ran, in reruns or when streaming.  I swear I've never seen it before.  

I wonder if it's the senility setting in or somehow, someway I've just never seen, or somehow never paid attention to this episode before.  It was actually pretty good.

Star trek has the least creative aliens of any sci fi franchise. Just take a white person, add some ridges to their bone facial structure, or some dots and you have 80% of aliens in Star Trek. Its like Gene Roddenberry tried to put in NO effort! And im talking about TNG and DS9, let alone TOS! TOS is a sad series all together, im just happy they didnt give up.

Being that they are the number one enemy of the Federation, why doesn't the Federation intruduce new hand to hand training techniques specifically designed to fight the Borg? For instance, Worf proves that an individual Borg is vulnerable to sword melee attacks. So one would think that next to the phaser rifle and pistol in the weapons closet, you would start to see swords that could be enhanced to easily cut through Borg exoskeletons/suits.

Pulling from a different universe, but a Vibroblade tech would be incredibly useful.

Maybe I am missing something, maybe the Borg armor is too tough for melee weapons. And this wouldn't help ship vs ship, but at least if they beamed over a Boarding party, you would have some defence against them when they adapted to your phasers.",startrek,1577827786,Nacido_Del_Sol,29,1,True,2019-12-31

173,"Season 6 Episode 15 of Star Trek The Next Generation, ""Tapestry"", has the same overarching premise as the movie Shrek 4. However, their conclusions could not be more different!","So I was watching Shrek 4 recently because it's the best film to ring in the new decade.

At the start of Tapestry Captain Picard goes to sickbay due to sustaining unexpected injuries. It's at this point he finds himself ""dead"". He talks to Q (**a being with godlike powers**), and mentions the regrets of his youth. He took risks as a young man, ended up in a fight with some Nausicaans, and had his natural heart replaced with an artificial one. **The only reason he is in this situation now is because of his past actions that he regrets.** 

Whereas with Shrek 4, Shrek is at a birthday party for his son. (An odd parallel here is that the actor who plays young Picard is also Patrick Stewart's son, this must be a subtle nod to the Shrek franchise.) He is strained and bored by married life. He eventually roars and runs off in a huff, having punched the birthday cake. He visits Rumpelstiltskin (**a being with godlike powers**) and mentions the regrets of being in the cinematic disaster Shrek the Third and wishes for it to be retconned. **The only reason he is in this situation now is because of his past actions that he regrets.** 

So, that's the initial setup. In Star Trek, the act of changing the past is done by not fighting the Nausicaans, whereas in Shrek 4 it's achieved by signing the contract. 

Either way, **both end up back in the present day with the past having been changed as they desired**. In both worlds neither Shrek nor Picard are well known (if they existed in the same universe, they would be brothers). 

Initially, **both are happy with their decisions**. Picard is alive as a Junior Science Officer, and Shrek is living the carefree life as an Ogre. **Both are free of significant responsibility**, as Picard is no longer Captain and Shrek doesn't have a family to care for. 

The revelation, brought by Q/Rumpelstiltskin is that they cannot go back. In the case of Tapestry, this is because if he goes back he will be dead. In the case of Rumpelstiltskin's deal, Rumpelstiltskin removed the day Shrek was born, and therefore he doesn't exist. 

Q is more of a force for good if we look at the Star Trek side, (if it even is Q) whereas Rumpel reverted time for his own gain. 

In either case, **both Jean Luc and Shrek regret their decision of changing the past**. 

BUT, here's the kicker.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Shrek wanted to get back to his boring life because otherwise he would be dead.**  
**Picard wanted to get back to his death because he could not stand having such a boring life.** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In either case, Shrek does true love's kiss and goes back to exactly where he left. Picard argues with Q to get him to revert himself back to his deathbed. 

Finally, if Sean Connery tried to make a portmanteau of Star Trek, it would be Shrek.

When her crew disagrees she threatens them, when her first officer objects, which is his job, she confines him to quarters. She makes decisions to put the whole crew at risk to save one life but she also decides to let whole worlds die due to the prime directive but also disobeys or ""bends it"" as she would say.

Neelix is an overgrown rat but his decisions rarely matter and don't put the crew at risk. When one of her crew boned someone she reprimanded him but two episodes latter she fell in love with a hologram, she constantly treats the doctor like a tricorder and doesn't take his opinions into account.

The writer's decided this was how her character was going to behave.

My post isn't about what I don't like about her--plenty--but *why* don't I like her exhibited behavior? Surely, other people like her character. They see her as strong, determinant, bold, bent on doing anything to keep her people safe and headed towards home.

So, do I not like Janeway because her character is poorly written, or can I just not stand her because she's a strong woman?

This argument is somewhat rhetorical. I don't have a problem with most other female characters--Uhura, Crusher, Troi, Ro, Dax. But, again, I do have a problem with Kira. I don't seem to enjoy the most common two highest-ranking female characters in Trek.

Pattern, or coincidence?

- The enterprise gets destroyed in both movies

Now, time for the confusing theory. I believe that in both movies, Bones and Spock are stranded together somewhere where no one can reach them. In Beyond, they are physically stranded on one area of the planet while the other crew members are somewhere else. In Search for Spock, Bones and Spock are essentially stranded together inside Bones’s mind.

Gambit is a bit weak, Sub Rosa is hilariously bad.. but that's really the extent of my problems with season 7.  Lower Decks was much better than it had any right to be, and frankly I'm disappointed we never got to see more of those characters throughout the franchise; they were all likable.  

OK, Homeward also is the one time I actually got kinda pissed off at the cast for being a bunch of sanctimonious ass-hats since the 1st season.  Maybe I'm answering my own question but -as a whole- I think it's dumped on way too much.

Fast forward to a few days ago when I caught an episode of Voyager titled ""Flashback"". The plot involved a mind-meld with Janeway and Tuvok to relive an old memory of when Tuvok was an ensign on the USS Excelsior under the command of Captian Sulu during the time of The Undiscovered Country. It was a decent episode but one conversation jumped out at me.

I'm going to summarise the discussion here, where there are more people, in the hope that this great idea might amount to something.","[https://www.reddit.com/r/sonicshowerthoughts/comments/dwhhnc/heres\_a\_thought\_how\_about\_an\_ar\_star\_trek\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonicshowerthoughts/comments/dwhhnc/heres_a_thought_how_about_an_ar_star_trek_game/)

Original post:

&gt;**Here's a thought: How about an AR Star Trek game? You play a Starfleet officer performing covert surveilance on a pre-warp civilization bearing remarkable resemblance to 21st century Earth. Your only tool is your tricorder, perfectly disguised to resemble the natives' ""smart phone"" technology.** 📷   
&gt;  
&gt;Get missions from your handler stationed in orbit, fight a shadow war against the Devidians from Time's Arrow or some other invisible aliens, and live every day like you're a Starfleet officer on a secret mission! Would you play?

Also from u/targetpractice_v01, in response to u/benzado's comment that the Prime Directive would prevent such action:

&gt;Maybe the mission revolves around cleaning up the mess of another Federation ship. That way it's upholding the Prime Directive. Like some other ship tried to scan a nearby interphasic rift or something and unleashed a bunch of pah wraith-sorta things, and now they're invading this planet and you have to go down there and catch 'em all--er, I mean, push them back into their native dimensional fold, yeah.

Again from u/targetpractice_v01:

&gt;The funny thing is, everyone's assuming time travel (maybe because I mention Time's Arrow?) but it doesn't take place on 21st century earth, it exists on an alien planet a lot \*like\* 21st century Earth. Like how classic Star Trek episodes sometimes took place on worlds a lot like Earth when they wanted to explore a modern theme. Thus we got Kirk waving an American flag and shouting the Declaration of Independence and Riker having ""alien"" sex with a UFO fanatic. In this case, you get all the ordinary trappings of modern life, but you can pretend everyone has eyebrow ridges or something, I dunno.

u/notheebie suggested that it could be used to croudsource work for good causes:

&gt;Could use it for social projects too like, ""Starfleet needs a team to cleanup xyz river! Fill up a trash bag with waste and dispose properly to complete your mission""

To which u/targetpractice_v01 replied:

&gt;That would be great! I was thinking how a game like this could have a positive impact by encouraging the players to think like Starfleet officers and hold themselves to Starfleet standards in their daily lives. The game could take it to the next level by partnering with local non-profits to sponsor volunteer events with in-game activities and special rewards.

This seems like a great idea, and while it would be difficult to make, Reddit has a lot of people, and it might be possible to make this a reality. Then again, maybe not.",startrek,1578086432,Albert_Newton,4,15,True,2020-01-03

**Above Average**

**Okay**

**Below Average**

* Final Mission (Picard-Wes convo only thing that saves this from bad)


**Bad**

* The Loss (Yikes, Deanna. Awful writing, awful execution)
* Night Terrors (crew going mad episodes are the worst, pls stop making them)


**Wtf was this** 

* none



Yes I know having all the two parters as creme de la creme is lame but imo they really knew what they did and why they made those two parters and I thoroughly enjoy them (spoiler, the next two parter will be up there too). 

Data's day a classic, don't think I need to say too much about that one. 

The Drumhead a wonderful Picard episode with an important message that imo could have been done well as a two parter too. Also, Simon Tarses' father/mother must be the most interesting character in the Quadrant we never see. 

Family was just a wonderful transition episode after BoBW and probably one of our all's fav Picard episodes. 

Brothers was equally great of a Data episode, the interactions with Dr.Soong were wonderful and sadly way too short. #F*ckLore

Half a life the first good lwaxana episode haha, she was still annoying at the start and in parts throughout it but the scientist was played wonderfully and seems like one of the nicest persons in the universe. Great conflict pointed out in this episode too. Really good stuff. 

In Theory was really sweet until the end parts. Picard randomly flying the shuttle when Data clearly is the best choice was just nonsense and bad writing imo and bugged me quite a bit. 

Future Imperfect tricked me quite a bit even on the rewatch and I'm glad it did, sadly the revelation towards the end made it less exciting for me. 

Final Mission is a massive yikes and horrible plot, however the Picard Wesley moments save it a little, especially the convo at the end. 

Hate me but I personally enjoyed Wesley and like the character. After he left every episode started to feel more serious, not sure if that was intended or just me. 

The Loss and Night Terrors are two awful Deanna episodes again.. I'm really sorry Deanna but you always get the shit character episodes, but the acting also isn't great . Her sobbing and cries of pain just feel so fake and sound just ugh. Nothing against Marina but thats just how I feel.

There would be public terminals that would be amped-up wikis, and google search engines, but wouldn't give you access to any internal ship systems, no matter how hard you try--and if you do try, security is alerted.

So many episodes hinge on a crew member just taking for granted whatever excuse another person gives for accessing a data terminal. If rotating shift codes (like 2FA, but 300 years more advanced) were needed to log-in, then rogue agents wouldn't be downloading data from the ship's computer.

Did they have to get into their full makeup to just shoot 1 or 2 lines of dialog?  I'd have to imagine it took hours to have everything put on and then taken off again.

286,I want the next Trek movie to have the Enterprise kicking ass,"Seriously. I know it's done to ratchet up tension and give convenient answers to ""why couldn't they just warp away?"" or ""why couldn't they just use x?"" Because x was damaged/disabled/destroyed when y attacked the ship. Fair enough. And it's to give great gems like having the bridge officers point out what they don't have and how they have to think outside the box, showing that great ingenuity, Technobabble optional, that Trek is so known for.

But just once I would like the Enterprise to just wreck someone's shit. When has the Enterprise just curb-stomped something, without getting blown to pieces first? The closest I can think of is the when the E destroyed the Plot Advancement Generator in First Contact , destroying a cube in minutes that took a fleet of ships days to even scratch (which even then, it spent the rest of the movie getting assimilated, so it got curb-stomped from inside)...or maybe if we're stretching it, in the 2009 movie when the Enterprise destroyed the Narada, but that was while it was being eaten by a black hole and  I....well we're just not gonna get into that, that's a whole separate post, but it's even more jarring when there's so much lore or when the characters outright state that the Enterprise is the ""newest/most advanced ship in the fleet"", and then it gets its ass handed to it. Just once I'd like to see it go toe-to-toe with, say, its Klingon or Romulan counterpart, no Macguffin, no Polarity Reversal, just standard starship engagement and decisive victory.

And for God's sake, don't destroy it again like they did in Beyond, I don't think writers understand we don't want to watch our favorite ship get dismembered.",startrek,1578201622,GuyTiberiusKirk,153,42,True,2020-01-05

*""Hall took a handful of people under his personal wing each year, for fast-tracking through the mysteries.  One of them was [Don Ingalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ingalls), who credits Hall with his successes as a film and television writer.  He wrote *Have Gun - Will Travel*, *Bonanza* and *Fantasy Island*, for those of you who may be old enough to remember such things.*

*""He was in the police department at the time and his partner was Gene Roddenberry, who created Star Trek.  A talk on [Blavatsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blavatsky) by Hall involving parallel universes became a Star Trek episode.*

*""Ingalls believes the popularity of the show stems from the themes of decency, morality, sacrifice for the common good.  He says, *'In a broad sense, my time with Manly helped expand my views of life.  His teachings of the great schools of philosophy were very helpful in my creative endeavors.  They expanded my capability and added a sense of balance, calmness, and self-control.  Basically, Hall helped me to develop a different personal balance system than chasing women and the fast buck, one based on honest labor and poise under pressure.'""*

Starfleet themselves back this up by covering it up (perhaps not sanctioned at the highest levels, but high enough to include several top brass) Riker, from his limited viewpoint as an ensign was doing as he was told.

Now Picard has to pull favours to view the report, suggesting he wasn't supposed to see so he himself is presumably breaking orders or at least protocol by accessing info he knowingly isn't supposed to see.  He then ends up getting angry at Riker for rightly saying you need to speak with the Admiral.

They eventually discover that the distortion was caused by the experiments of Dr. Paul Manheim. Dr. Manheim had been experimenting with the effects of gravity and time, and had found a way to contact another universe. However, his experiments were causing distortions across several thousand light years, and Captain Picard decides to send Commander Data down alone to stop the experiment, as Data was the least affected by the effects of the time distortion. Near the end of the episode, Data must dispense a specific amount of antimatter into the dimensional ""window"" to close it. He then asks Geordi to set a countdown for him on his mark. Now, my question is, why would data need a countdown when he is perfectly capable of, counting it himself in his positronic brain, with significantly higher accuracy than possible by a human?

I know this has been discussed before, but it was either write this or reflect on why I was spending hours taking screenshots and making gifs on a Star Trek character that appears in 2 episodes.  So here we are.

Geordi is told Dr. Brahms is coming to visit.  He immediately celebrates in front of Picard, who is confused but does not really care.  He then talks to Guinan about meeting his ""dream"" and how he does not necessarily have romantic intentions.

Upon meeting, they instantly forge a cold relationship, arguing about his changes to Enterprise, which she designed.  From the get go, Geordi constantly makes weird comments demonstrating he knows a lot about her.  When she confronts him on this in the engine room, he becomes angry and confrontational.  To smooth things over, he offers dinner at his place and she agrees.

Despite what he said earlier about romance, when then get a long scene of Geordi setting the mood for a dinner date with Dr. Brahms.  He spends time lowering the lighting and picking music.  When she shows up, she is instantly uncomfortable with the setting, commenting on Geordi not wearing his uniform.  He says he did it to make HER comfortable.

They sit and start talking, and Geordi continues for no reason to creepily comment on how he knows and understands her, eventually shifting to sit closer to her.  When she opens up and says she is not often comfortable around people, Geordi says she hasn't met the right people.  He is coming on very, very strong.

She eventually says she needs to leave as it is not appropriate.  When asking about when they can meet the next day, Georgi responds in a curt, hurt tone.

Crawling around in Fefferies tubes or some shit, Leah finally confronts Geordi about how weird he is acting.  Geordi kind of lies and says he has always been a big fan of her work and that he thinks they could become ""maybe good friends"".  She drops the bomb that she is married.  Insanely, he never bothered to look this up.

Geordi tells Guinan about how sad he is.  She tries to remind him that Leah is a person and he fell in love with a non-person.  Geordi sighs heavily.

Of course, Leah finds he program with her recreating.  He rushed over but it is too late.  She is angry, understandably I think.  Again maybe the fact that he did it is not super weird? People argue that all the time.  But what stood out to me was that he was so dishonest about it to her from the start.

Anyway, Geordi explains it wasn't like a sex doll thing but she doesn't believe him because, again, he lied about everything else up to this point.

He then goes FULL NICE GUY and explains how fucking patience and nice her has been to her since she has been here.  He has the balls to say he is ""guilty of reaching out to her"" when he has been trying to get in her pants since she showed up.  He leaves.

Anyway, they get rid of a space baby or something and seem to be fast friends now.  She then tries to apologize to him.  In his defense he does admit he should of been straight with her from the beginning.

With how the Season 3 finale of Disco ends, we can see that the Picard series is officially a prequel series like Enterprise and Discovery season 1 and 2 were, and undoubtedly doomed to fail just like ENT and DSC. Frankly, I'd like to see Trek keep blazing a new path into the future, not taking niche characters from 80's shows and trying to shoehorn in new stories in a tiny pocket of a huge universe.

/s (But it IS a prequel show now!)

Also, I think as a fandom we need to get a little more fun about TLAs for shows. I REALLY thought we should have been using STD for Disco because it's funny, and if not that, then DIS. And for Picard, we're going with PIC? I vote for STP, because he's keeping the engine running and he rocks.

Lastly, on S31. Lots of folks keep wondering how Empress Georgiou gets back to the 23rd century for her Section 31 show. *Who says she goes back to the 23rd century?* The Federation in the 33rd century is a ghost of what it once was, and it'll need it's own Section 31 rebuilt in the 33rd century.

343,My extensive list of episodes/movies to watch before the premiere of PICARD,"My wife and son are *Star Trek* fans, but they're not as afflicted as I am, so I curated a selection of episodes to watch before the debut of *Picard*.  I chose episodes based on their focus, so long as they fell into one of five categories: Picard episode, Data episode, Seven episode, Romulan episode, and Borg episode.  Also, every episode I chose had to at least be ""pretty good.""

(Of course, at this stage, we don't really know how much screen time Seven will get in the new series, for example, so watching a bunch of *Voyager* episodes may prove to be a waste of time if she's only in it for an episode.  That's the risk and your mileage may vary.)  

In order:

*ENT* - ""Minefield""

(See below for ""Regeneration"")

*ENT* - ""United""

*ENT* - ""The Aenar""

*TOS* - ""Balance of Terror""

(Didn't include ""The Deadly Years"" as the Romulans weren't really a focus of the episode.)

*TOS* - ""The Enterprise Incident""

*TNG* - ""Encounter at Farpoint""

*TNG* - ""The Battle""

*TNG* - ""Datalore""

(Didn't choose ""The Neutral Zone"" because the Romulan story was a relatively minor B-plot compared to the awakened cryo-sleepers.)

*TNG* - ""The Measure of a Man""

*TNG* - ""Q Who""

*TNG* - ""Who Watches the Watchers""

*TNG* - ""The Enemy""

*TNG* - ""The Defector""

*TNG* - ""The Offspring""

*TNG* - ""Allegiance""

*TNG* - ""Captain's Holiday""

*TNG* - ""Sarek""

*TNG* - ""The Best of Both Worlds""

(Just for kicks, when Admiral Hanson's signal cut out during the Battle of Wolf 359, I paused the Blu-ray and went to the CBS app and we watched the first few minutes of *DS9*'s ""The Emissary.""  It was pretty cool.)

*TNG* - ""Family""

*TNG* - ""Brothers""

*TNG* - ""Data's Day""

*TNG* - ""Qpid""

*TNG* - ""The Drumhead""

*TNG* - ""The Mind's Eye""

*TNG* - ""Darmok""

*TNG* - ""Unification""

*TNG* - ""I, Borg""

*TNG* - ""The Inner Light""

*TNG* - ""Chain of Command""

*TNG* - ""Face of the Enemy""

*TNG* - ""Tapestry""

*TNG* - ""Starship Mine""

*TNG* - ""Lessons""

*TNG* - ""The Chase""

*TNG* - ""Descent""

*TNG* - ""Gambit""

*TNG* - ""Attached""

*TNG* - ""The Pegasus"" (At least for the teaser scene set on ""Captain Picard Day"")

*TNG* - ""All Good Things ...""

*Star Trek: Generations*

(I contemplated adding some *DS9* Romulan episodes, but because the Romulans were present only as a player in the Dominion War, that felt a bit off topic.)

*Star Trek: First Contact*

*ENT* - ""Regeneration""

*VOY* - ""Scorpion""

*VOY* - ""The Raven""

*VOY* - ""The Omega Directive""

*VOY* - ""Drone""

*VOY* - ""Infinite Regress""

*VOY* - ""Dark Frontier""

*VOY* - ""Someone to Watch Over Me""

*VOY* - ""Collective""

*VOY* - ""Child's Play""

*VOY* - ""Unimatrix Zero""

*VOY* - ""Imperfection""

*VOY* - ""Body and Soul""

*VOY* - ""Human Error""

*VOY* - ""Endgame""

*Star Trek: Nemesis*

*Star Trek* (2009) - specifically, Spock Prime's mind meld with Kirk

*Short Treks* - ""Children of Mars"" (hasn't been released at the time of this writing, but we've been told it ties in)

And that's it.  I plainly state that this list is made up of episodes that *I* find to be most interesting and connected to each of the categories I wanted (Picard, Data, Seven, Romulans, Borg).  If there's an episode you would have included that I didn't, by all means, insert it yourself in your own rewatch.  Like I said, YMMV.

* Picard - yes and often (horse riding, vacations...)

* Riker - the same (vacations, sleeping pajamas)
 
* Troi - yes...
 
* Crusher - yes (breakfast with Picard and working on her plays in casual)
 
* Crusher Little - yes, he wears his sweater and doesn't wear uniform to dates.
 
* Worf - rarely, almost always in Starfleet uni. Sometimes switching to Klingon uni. 
 
* La Forge - he was wearing casual on a date with Dr.Brahms once. But he even sleeps in his uniform, wtf.

355,"It's odd that Voyager doesn't list the rank of the characters during the opening credits, (Discovery is even worse)","1. During the opening credits of Voyager, only Janeway is given a rank, ""Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway"". Every other actor / character is only defined by their real name, and their character name--no other ranks are given. I watched TNG as it aired live (Thursday nights at 8), and every character's name, as well as the actor's real name is seared into my memory. Not that anybody would, but someone could ask me any variation of who played what character, or what rank did ""Levar Burton's character have on Star Trek?"", and I could tell you (along with millions of other fans, I'm sure). I never built an internal catalog of what ranks existed on the Voyager Bridge, and I think it hurt my familiarity with the show.
2. Neelix, Seven, and The Doctor don't have ranks. Why not? Troi had a rank. Janeway gave Seven systems access (until she disobeyed a direct order and lost the privilege), so she must have had an equivalent of rank. The same goes for Neelix, and The Doctor.
3. Discovery is worse than Voyager in terms of opening credits. Only actor names are given, no character names, and no ranks. It's ""easy enough"" (but I shouldn't have to) to look them up (not the case back in the early 1990's unless you bought a sourcebook!), but I could probably only get half the character names (and first names at that, except for Burnham--okay, Stamets too, because I actually have one of the real Stamets' mycology books) right on a impromptu quiz...

I don't want to discuss too much because if you have seen it, you know it, and if you haven't you should watch it fresh.

I think this is one of the greatest episodes of all Star Trek. At least top 20 of mine, and I have watched everything at least twice. 

Without talking too much about the plot, I'll try to describe why I give it credit. This is one of Voyager's best episodes as it takes place solely within the bounds of the ship and is a character driven plot. I think those are some of Voyager's best kind, although not essential. Each character truly has their own moment, and it's pretty genuine. I feel the rest of the series can get a little sappy where characters seem to literally say things like ""Well you know me, I'm always the one to do that type of thing"", they characters really come together. Moments of beauty. In fact I might say this episode also has one of the most touching Tuvok moments where he expresses his affection to Janeway with such a simple act (almost a non-act) , but knowing what that means to him is a highlight of his character.

Why I would suggest it is one of the greatest episodes across all series is, again trying not to reveal too much, the crew is faced with a problem they can't face. No sudden getting warp drive back on line. No sudden adjustment of some deflector pulse. No out. The crew has to face a power beyond them. And do they face it with dignity?

###A Crash Course on Jean-Luc Picard


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, “Family”

In the wake of being captured and absorbed into the Borg Collective in the season three finale and season four premiere, Picard returns home on shore leave for the first time in almost 20 years. The trauma of the Borg’s torture weighs heavily on Picard, even as he claims he is alright. While most of his family greets him warmly, Picard’s brother is cold towards him due to their differing outlooks on technology and the future. Ultimately, they are able to reconcile, but not before Picard has to confront his own trauma. 

At one point, Picard talks to his friend Louis about how while he was happy his family kept traditions alive, he wasn’t bound to those traditions. Louis replies that Picard always reached for the future. We know that Picard has returned to his family’s vineyard, so what drove him to abandon the future in pursuit of the past? That might be a mystery left for the pilot of Picard, but this is an excellent episode for fans to get a feel for Picard’s psychology and deepen the mystery of what could have made him leave Starfleet.

Tragedy struck the Picard family in the movie Star Trek: Generations, during which Picard finds out that his brother and nephew have died in a fire. Picard is now the last of his family, and without him, there is no one to keep the traditions alive. This is yet another tragedy for the captain, and sets up the groundwork for his ultimate return to the family vineyard.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Drumhead”

After the warp drive is damaged and Romulan interference is suspected, retired Admiral Norah Satie is brought on to find who on the Enterprise could be a spy. Despite finding a Klingon officer who is leaking information, it is revealed that the supposed sabotage was in fact a simple malfunction and not an attack. Satie is unsatisfied, though, and begins a fanatical hunt to find a traitor on the Enterprise, much to Picard’s dismay. 

This is an episode that showcases Picard’s strong sense of justice. He says he will not treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so, and he stands tall in defense of his crew and himself. Picard is firm, but he stands for the scales of justice in the universe being balanced. He will not allow anyone to remove due process or to play judge and jury. We can assume that Picard’s innate sense of righteousness and justice will come into play as he faces the Romulans in their newly imperiled state in Picard, because one of the reasons Picard is such a powerful character is that he will do the right thing to ensure that justice is served, not revenge


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The First Duty”

Picard imparts an important lesson to young Wesley Crusher in this episode. When Wesley’s squadron suffers an accident that costs a cadet his life, it is revealed the squadron was attempting a banned maneuver. Ultimately, Wesley reveals the truth at a hearing to uncover what happens, and Picard’s trust in him is restored. Picard comforts Wesley and says that while the immediate future will be hard, ultimately he will have respect and trust from his fellow students again, even if Wesley doubts this.

Picard has unwavering faith in his crew and his family, including Wesley. When that trust is broken, he does not immediately berate Wesley and cut him out of his family but offers him a chance to fix his mistakes. His offer of a way to mend this broken trust shows the empathetic side of the captain, and his unshakable trust in those he cares for. Picard, even with his stern nature, has always been incredibly kind and loyal to his own crew. This is what makes him such a strong captain, and reminds us why so many are willing to follow him into the jaws of death.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “The Inner Light”

In one of the best hours of Trek from any series, Picard finds himself living a whole new life in a dreamlike state. On the planet Kataan, Picard is now known as Kamin, a regular man with a wife and a family. Twenty minutes pass as the Enterprise crew tries to revive their captain, but during that short period of time Picard lives an entire lifetime on the dying world, experiencing the planet’s culture and world even as it enters its final years. 

It is revealed that the inhabitants of the planet sent the probe into so that someone, “a teacher,” could learn about them and remember them following their planet’s demise. The probe found Picard, and so he carries with him a civilization that has been dead a thousand years. It’s a deeply moving episode that sets up the idea of Picard as someone who carries the legacy of those who have come before inside of him. If you need a reminder of Picard’s capacity for empathy and compassion, this is the perfect example. Besides, it’s a phenomenal episode in the Trek canon, and worth a revisit just to be reminded of the highest of highs from the franchise. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “Chain of Command, Part I and II”

While on a secret mission to destroy a Cardassian biological weapon, Picard is captured and tortured both physically and psychologically by a ruthless military leader. While he is ultimately saved, he privately admits to counselor Deanna Troi that he was at his breaking point by the time of his release and was willing to do anything to get the torture to stop, even if he was rescued before he had the chance to break under the strain.

Picard has endured many traumas in his life and his time as the captain of the Enterprise, but it is important that he admits his own humanity in these moments. Weakness is not a failure, not to him, and he allows himself moments where he can be human rather than a stalwart captain. If Picard can survive and endure, then we can all take lessons from him that we can also endure our own personal traumas. Picard survives, no matter what. We, the viewers, can all survive as well. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Tapestry”

After an attack during a mission, Picard is sent into cardiac arrest as his artificial heart is put under strain. When he “dies” from his wounds, he runs into old friend Q, who gives him the chance to relive the events that led to him receiving an artificial heart. These events would have led to his survival during that particular mission, but he would not have become the captain of the Enterprise due to an aversion to risk. Picard declares he’d rather die as captain than live as no one. Q returns him to his timeline, where he survives and reflects on his experience.

Q tells Picard that his near death experience as a cadet taught him about his mortality and how life is too short to play it safe. This led to Picard being the man he is during the events of Next Generation and the ensuing films. Picard knows that his life is too brief to waste it by doing nothing. He must take action, which makes his new profession in Picard so interesting. There is nothing wasteful about returning to his family’s vineyard, but it is not as risky or remarkable as his time as captain.

Could Picard see something that challenges his worldview in the beginning of the upcoming series? What could happen that could make Picard choose a safer path? And is it even a safer path, or is there a secret behind Picard’s newfound quiet life? 


##Star Trek: Insurrection

In the third film featuring the Next Generation crew, Picard discovers a plot by the Son’a people to forcibly relocate the peaceful Ba’ku people so they can exploit their planet for its rejuvenating properties; the process would poison the planet with radiation, rendering it unlivable. Picard ultimately stops the Son’a from harvesting the planet which leads to the Ba’ku forgiving the Son’a and reuniting their people. 

When Picard finds out that the Federation is involved with the Son’a’s plot, he does not stand by. Instead he fights for what he feels is ultimately right. We know that Picard is not above disobeying orders and fighting for the little guy when he knows it is right, which is key to both his character and to the philosophy of Star Trek in general. 

When faced with his new challenges in Picard, will our captain once more have to rebel against Starfleet? We know he leaves his role as admiral, which points to a philosophical break between the two. Picard’s inner sense of right and wrong is key to his character, and I can’t wait to see what drives him to both leave Starfleet and, later, return to the stars. 



###Learn to Love The Borg


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “The Best of Both Worlds, Part I and II”

In this harrowing season finale, Picard is captured by the Borg and turned into Locutus, mouthpiece for the Borg army. The Enterprise faces a horrible choice: fire upon the Borg ship and destroy their captain, or allow the Borg to continue traveling towards Earth. Riker, acting as captain, makes the choice to fire on the ship… but thankfully, the Borg are undamaged and the crew has a second chance to save their captain. 

Picard is ultimately rescued and returned to his human state, but at great cost to his mind and body. The torture he underwent with the Borg was immense, and it deeply impacted the character and his relationship with the Borg going forward. As one of his archenemies, the Borg might have exacted the greatest personal toll from him. And yet, Picard remains the steadfast leader he has always been. It just takes some healing, as we saw in the episode “Family.” 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “I, Borg”

Picard faces off against the Borg again when the away team discovers an injured Borg drone on an icy planet. When Dr. Crusher is unable to stand by and let the drone die, Picard allows her to bring him on board. When he learns that he has the chance to use their prisoner to end the Borg threat, ultimately Picard chooses to let the newly named Hugh live, rather than destroy the entire Collective.

This episode presents Picard with a difficult philosophical question. Is all fair in the battle against the Borg? Is an individual to blame for all the sins the Borg have committed? When encountering Hugh, Picard’s assumptions about the Borg are challenged, and in doing so Picard becomes a stronger, better leader. It shows his willingness to find the humanity in all he meets, even if he is facing off against an enemy that has never extended him or his crew the same grace.

This is particularly important in the wake of “The Best of Both Worlds,” during which the Borg tortured Picard. The Borg were more than willing to destroy Picard for their own gains, but he is not willing to exact revenge in a manner that would be both cruel and unusual. This marks Picard’s humanity, and his compassionate nature. He is tough, but never cruel, and that is what makes him stand out as a character.


##Star Trek: First Contact

With the Borg headed for Earth, Picard is drawn back into the fray against this treacherous enemy. The Borg travel back in time to prevent first contact between humans and Vulcans and assimilate the planet, but the Enterprise, along with a couple intrepid new friends, are able to stop them by neutralizing their threat. While most of the Borg still exist in the future, the Borg Queen is taken out, alongside her ship.

The Borg are complicated and fascinating villains, and it will be interesting to see how they are featured in Picard. As with many characters, Picard ventures beyond the end of the known timeline to explore the future of Starfleet. Have the Borg recovered their power to try and take over the universe again, or are they now refugees and scattered survivors? Again, these are the questions we’ll have to wait to answer.


##Star Trek: Voyager, Episode “The Raven”

The only Voyager episode on our list, this episode focuses on Seven of Nine, who will be making an appearance in Star Trek: Picard. Recently freed from the Borg Collective, she is trying to learn once more to be human. She ultimately discovers her parent's ship, the Raven, which she was assimilated on when the Borg captured her and her family years before. When Janeway, at the end of the episode, offers to give her records of her parents, she says that she'll read them one day.

Seven of Nine is a beloved character, and this episode highlights her nuance and complexity. It also highlights the tragic nature of her life. Assimilation isn't easy, and her struggle to become human again shows her courage. What will she be like when Picard runs into her out in the universe? We can only wait to see.



###Getting to Know Data


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Datalore”

In one of the first episodes to highlight Data and his brother, Lore, “Datalore” features Brent Spiner playing both androids. It also serves as an origin story, as it explains where Data came from and who made him. While Lore is a decidedly evil creation, Data serves as a figure of good. Lore says he is the second and more “perfect” model, he’s lying and is envious of Data being the second and improved creation.

This episode drew praise for Spiner’s performance, and it highlights not only Data’s loyalty to the crew but the goodness seemingly coded into his being. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Measure of a Man”

The debate over Data’s personhood rages on in this episode, as the crew engages in a debate over whether or not Data is a person or if he is property of Starfleet. When a Starfleet officer wants to experiment on Data, Riker is forced to argue against Data’s personhood, though ultimately Data and Picard are able to prove that Data is a sentient being and therefore entitled to the autonomy of making his own choices.

This is a key episode in Data’s story. He is more than a machine used by Starfleet, but instead is a deeply human character, even if he is an android. Data displays the human trait of forgiveness both towards the officer who wanted to experiment on him and towards Riker, who deeply regrets his role in the proceedings. To paraphrase Captain Kirk, of all the souls Picard and the Enterprise met on their journeys, Data’s might be the most human.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Brothers”

Lore and Dr. Noonien Soong, Data’s creator, are both back in this episode that once more highlight’s Data’s humanity. Both Data and Lore are recalled to Soong's deathbed, where he intends to give Data a chip that allows him to experience emotions. However, Lore deceives Soong and is able to receive the chip instead. Data apologizes for not being able to grieve his creator's loss and returns to the Enterprise, where he reflects on what has happened.

Data's quest for emotions is key to his character, and this episode highlights this journey. While Lore ultimately gets the chip, Data remains the more human of the two brothers. Even without a chip to experience emotions, Data can still be empathetic to a degree his brother cannot.



###Everything You Need to Know About Romulans


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, “The Defector”

Picard tries to help a Romulan admiral defecting from the Empire in this episode. Admiral Jarok makes the choice to never see his family again to help the Federation; ultimately, his defection is used by the Romulans to stage a trap for the Enterprise. Though Jarok kills himself, Picard is left with a note for Jarok's family and the knowledge that some Romulans have the courage to push back against the Romulan Empire. 

This is a key episode for Romulan-Federation relationships, and establishes that while Picard isn't the biggest fan of the Romulans, he respects them. Given the pending destruction of the Romulan homeworld, this is incredibly important. After all, Picard will be faced with the decision to extend his hand to help the Romulans, even after fighting with them in various episodes. That is the mark of a truly good captain.


##Star Trek: Nemesis 

Picard faces off against the Romulan leader Shinzon in Nemesis, who has staged a coup of the Romulan government and who says he wants peace with the Federation, but who secretly plots their demise. Shinzon is a clone of Picard, originally created by the Romulans to plant a spy in the Federation, but was abandoned on the planet Remus to die instead. When Shinzon attempts to eradicate all life on Earth, ultimately two Romulan ships attempt to aid the Enterprise in stopping him, not wanting to be associated with Shinzon’s schemes.

Picard is able to defeat his clone and foil his plot, but it is Data who makes the ultimate sacrifice by staying on Shinzon’s ship to ultimately destroy it and die in the process. The crew parts ways, with Riker heading to negotiate peace with the Romulans on the USS Titan. Picard discovers that Data has implanted his neural networks on another android, B-4, which means that he can ultimately return. 

This was, until now, the end of the story of Picard and his crew. We know that Data will return, and so will other crew members. It is still a high note to end on, even with Data’s loss; after all, the Federation might find peace with their longtime enemy. However, a threat was looming in the universe that no one could have prepared for, one that will lead into the coming story...


##Star Trek (2009)

The JJ Abrams helmed film sets up one of the key plots in Star Trek: Picard. The film reveals that the Romulan homeworld is destroyed by a star going supernova. While Ambassador Spock was able to save the rest of the universe, he was unable to save the planet, and in turn he created a black hole that swallowed his ship as well as a Romulan mining craft bent on revenge. While the majority of the galaxy was saved, Spock and the Romulan ship were sent careening into a different timeline. That marked the end of what we call the Prime Timeline prior to the end of the second season of Star Trek: Discovery. 

Picard takes place in the Prime Timeline after the destruction of Romulus and the forced relocation of the Romulan people. Given that Picard had tangled with the Romulans throughout The Next Generation and some of the cast’s films, this sets up an interesting dynamic.

370,Odo pretending to drink coffee,"I would've linked a clip of this, but alas, YouTube's giving me nothing.

Context: at the end of the (excellent) episode The Die is Cast, Odo proposes having breakfast with Garak sometime. (Wit this and with Bashir monopolising his lunchtimes, Garak's running out of meals in the day -- anyone else who wants to spend some quality mealtime with him had better get in on the dinners quickly!)

There's a slight flaw in this plan, though:

&gt;GARAK: Why, Constable, I thought you didn't eat.  
ODO: I don't. 

Fast forward to the season 4 premiere, The Way of the Warrior, and the promised breakfast is taking place. Odo's solution to the breakfast dilemma is incredible:

&gt;GARAK: Fascinating. So both the cup and the liquid are merely extensions of your body.  
ODO: That is correct. And if I want to, I can even drink the liquid, reabsorb it, and produce new coffee in the cup. (he demonstrates) This way I can give the illusion that I'm sharing in the dining experience.  
GARAK: Very thoughtful.

I love this moment. It's hilarious, it's ingenious (top 10 use of shapeshifter powers?) and... it genuinely is a pretty thoughtful thing to do. A sweet little way for Odo to fit in with the solids.

Just... nobody else try drinking Odo's coffee. Slime time!

(one more thing: Odo and Garak leave their breakfast table not long after this conversation's taken place, and I kept an eye on the table to see what would happen with the coffee mug -- it's disappeared entirely once they've got up, presumably reabsorbed back into Odo during a brief moment when he's offscreen.

371,Trek-a-thon for Climate Justice,"My wife and I live in Canberra, Australia, bunkered down trying to not head out into the smoke of burning forests, but we want to help. We're hosting an event that mixes Star Trek and fundraising for an Indigenous youth-led climate justice org. The more you donate, the more we watch.

Lots of people are fundraising and donating in various ways to the more immediate needs of bushfire relief, and while that's necessary, we wanted to highlight and raise funds for the kind of work that will halt, heal, and mitigate the effects of climate disruption, as part of a greater effort to create a more just future for all. We've got to be about the business of building community resilience and decolonising our societies as we live the realities of a climate changed world—especially as it will be, and already is, the most vulnerable and marginalised among us who are bearing and will continue to bear the brunt of the crisis.

So, reach into your pockets for isiks and dig around in the couch for quatloos, because there's no 'peace and long life' on a dead planet.

It frustrates me to no end that the writers took a look at this story and said ""What TOS character fits best in this story?"" and rather than choosing any one of the evil or broken Starfleet leaders (Garth, Kodos, Decker) they choose someone **who isn't even from the same time period**!

It means making an Effort to put out a meaningful story for Captain Hikaru Sulu and crew who we only saw in back in Star Trek 6 as the Klingon Moon Praxis explodes.

What would be a viable tale? A ships emergency transponder summons Excelsior to Betelgeuse... the excelsior experiences a total power failure while transporting people on board mid rescue. A murder is committed. The killer is unknown but where technology would allow the Excelsior crew to determine the perpetrator, they must make do with primitive investigation tools such as crushed powder to take fingerprints, and interrogate passengers and crew. And the criminal found, ship powers up allowing the evacuation to continue and Betelgeuse goes supernova. And we find the investigations were being overseen by an all powerful unidentified alien judiciary (Q entity) who have decided they will continue studying the early Federation to see if this is a viable alternate reality worth further experimentation. Admonished by Captain Sulu for interfering in a criminal investigation by powering down the ship, and all technology, and endangered lives for your own amusement. Q says ""You humans like to roll the dice."" Ending the conversation by rolling a little dice cube. ""Lets see how you go against the Borg..."" the cube grows into a borg cube.

383,Picard's Painting of the USS Enterprise 1701-D - Digital Transfer / Restoration in Progress,"Hello all,

I am currently working on a project to recreate Picard's painting (down to the frame and size) for my living room.

The process is slow, because to my knowledge large prints of this don't exist, so I had to go off of a small print that has words on it. I've been able to remove the words and restore the solar flares in the bits I've done so far (have been doing it in increments and cleaning it up as I go along). I have it about 30% done ([example](https://i.imgur.com/jMoMbNH.png), also this is a fraction of the resolution my actual file is being created at).

I was wondering if anyone has knowledge (or possession) of a print of this that is closer to the one seen on the show, which had a lot more blue coloration, because I would like to do a digital transfer of that version of it as well. It's surprising to me how hard it is to find large prints of this (both the original and the updated version) and also how there are no HD versions of this image on the internet really.

If anyone has a print of this painting that shares more of the color scheme that the painting on the show did, and would be willing to send it out so I can do a digital transfer of it then send it back, that would be pretty sweet. Regardless I intend to finish the digital transfer and removal of text on this print.

We were cooking and normally when I'm watching something I'll shut it off, but she was so into the episode i was not allowed to turn it off, I had to pause it.  


It feels so great to share this with her, my best memories are ones with my grandfather and seeing her enjoy it, knowing she's never seen it even if i've seen it dozens of times makes me so happy.",startrek,1574826696,MrTyTheCannabisGuy,6,1,True,2019-11-26

405,I've just finished Voyager. Better than I was expecting after watching DS9.,"Yes, wow! My favorite kind of Science Fiction (**exploration and positive aspects of humanity**) was back! A well deserved TNG continuation with a few here-and-there elements of TOS.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm watching Star Trek in chronological order, so after watching DS9, I was skeptical about what was going on ""next"". Despite having without any bout the most capable cast (other than Sisko and Bashir, whom I've never liked), I never quite bonded with DS9's philosophy, but I can totally see why it can be a modern favorite: violence, plot twists, guns, straight up entertainment, revenge, violence, ""badass"" characters, dark humor, violence.

&amp;#x200B;

I've still yet to re watch some really good episodes, specially the two-part ones, which are probably the best I've seen in all Star Trek.

My favorites: **Year of Hell** and **Blink of an eye. J**ust fucking wow! Two of the finest sci-fi stories I've ever experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost everything was good, I could talk a lot of these things, but I'll have to mention the few things I really didn't like in order to be more fair.

&amp;#x200B;

So here my only 2 cons I can think of:

Closure was weak.

Compared to rest of other Treks, characters and actors are not that good; they're all mostly low profile-ish, but after 1st season, I never really payed attention to this. Kes, Harry, and Seven of Nine were just... meh.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm more than happy, can't stop smiling after watching it and I salute everyone who made VOY possible :D

However every Star Trek spinoff has gone through the same cycle. TNG was heavily criticized when it first aired (and rightfully so during those first 2 seasons). Once DS9 came out, people loved TNG and criticized DS9, same thing with VOY and of course ENT. All those shows still have their critiques but are otherwise looked upon favorably by fans now.

451,The Defector (TNG S3 Discussion),"I'm currently undergoing a TNG rewatch, and thank god I finally made it to Season 3. I've never seen the quality of a show skyrocket between seasons the way TNG did. I mean Season 2 of TNG is already a step up from the dumpster fire of S1, with some fantastic episodes like Q Who, and Measure of a Man, but Season 3 is when TNG got episodes that great on a consistent basis.

I mean, The Survivors, The Enemy, Who Watches the Watchers: all great stuff. And the best part is I'm only half-way through the season so far! Even with all the stellar episodes there's been, The Defector has been my favorite on this rewatch. 

What's best about this episode is definitely the script. Ronald D. Moore takes a page from Nicholas Meyer and throws in some classic literature, in this case Shakespeare's Henry V. I always love when Star Trek alludes to classic literature; it always gives the series some credence and makes it enjoyable to find all the similarities between the stories being told. The dialogue and pacing of the episode is perfect as well. 

Every scene matters and every line of dialogue feels natural while at the same time it moves the story along. This episode has such a great and simple premise: what if a Romulan defected and warned of an invasion? Should he be trusted? Should Picard ignore his warnings and possibly let his people die? It's such a wonderful, complicated question of morality, and I think it's during situations like this that Star Trek is at its best. A lesser writer likely would not be able to extend such a simple premise into a 45 minute scenario, but I think it's safe to say Ronald D. Moore knows what he's doing. 

What are your thoughts on this episode? What is the best Romulan episode in all of Star Trek? As much as I love this episode I may be a *The Enterprise Incident* man myself.",startrek,1575000598,ggg375,27,1,True,2019-11-28

458,Genuine discussion about thoughts on Discovery (SPOILERS),"I’m sure this has been discussed ad nauseam already, but I’m generally curious about everyone’s thoughts on why it does or doesn’t work, from people who both do or don’t like it.  As for me... I’m not sure how I feel. I don’t hate it; apparently I have enough interested in it to have watched the first two seasons with my brother and girlfriend when they were released, and both of them genuinely like it. And there are aspects that I do like, such as the production value, the cinematography... basically, the technicals are all very good (I’d like it better if it was shot on film instead of digital, but that’s a different story). The acting is mostly decent, despite there being lots of awkward moments sprinkled in that feel so forced (“This is the power of math, people!”). It’s mainly the story and the characters that I just can’t bring myself to like. To be fair, I love both DS9 and ENT, since both of those showed how the best of humanity can ultimately survive, even when put to the test. And I think that’s what Discovery is going for too. The problem is... we never see the best of humanity in the show, instead we see people who are okay with causing death and destruction and don’t have to grapple with their inner humanity. And that’s I think why people say, “this doesn’t feel like Star Trek.” And I feel like that comes from the fact that the stories are just so generic and action-oriented. Not that you can’t have action in Star Trek, because I actually very much liked Beyond. But every time I feel like the story is about to go somewhere interesting, it just defaults back to the most generic space battle or phaser fight, and those aren’t interesting... they’re just CGI headaches that have no investment because I can literally see those anywhere. Hell, I can make them myself if I want to, I know how to use After Effects, I’m a filmmaker myself. Every story twist just feels... wrong, which is too bad because they miss so many great opportunities they set up. Like Emperor Georgeou (forgive me for most likely spelling that wrong). That could be such an interesting dynamic between her and Burnham, but they just don’t do anything with it. Which is a shame, because Michelle Yeoh is such a talented actress. And the character of Lorca, I found fascinating... showing how you need the dark side to be able to bring back the light, and Starfleet PTSD, that could have been interesting... then they just made him a generic Mirror Universe bad guy and ruined any dee characterization they had set up. And I really like Anson Mount as Pike, I’d much rather watch a show about him, he feels like a great Star Trek Captain... but then they just write him out at the end of season 2. And now, with season 3 taking place like what, 900 years in the future? I just... I don’t know if I care enough to watch it. The rest of the characters, I just can’t get invested in. They have such little characterization, all they do is serve to spout out technobabble which, yes I know was also in other Star Trek, but... it feels like Discovery exists to serve the technobabble instead of t he technobabble exciting to serve Discover, and it just feels way to convenient when they solve every single problem in 5 minutes with increasingly ludicrous excuses. So, every character I care about is gone, the other characters are way too generic and underwritten, and the story just keeps losing me with every twist... am I missing something here? I want to like Discovery, I really do... I just can’t see myself putting in the time to watch anymore of it. And Picard... just looks so bad. It looks like the Rogue One of Star Trek. Generic action mixed with so much fan service and no plot. I’ll give it a try, and I want to like that too, but... I don’t have high hopes. 

Anyways, I can’t wait to hear everyone’s thoughts! Even if you completely disagree with me, I still respect your opinions and am interested to hear your reasoning.

477,Hot take: The Maquis exhibited an incredible level of stupidity and frankly deserved to be slaughtered if they were so dumb as to think they could stay in the DMZ. I don't understand why the writers thought viewers would sympathize with them at all.,"There's a S3 episode of TNG called ""The Ensigns of Command"". In it, the Enterprise learns that a fleet of aliens is trying to colonize a world, which is apparently already occupied by about 15,000 human colonists. When negotiations fail, the aliens give the Federation 3 days to evacuate these people, and Data is tasked with convincing them to leave. 

The colonists frankly come across as ignorant hicks, and refuse to pick up and leave, believing that they can somehow fight these alien warships without weapons (no, seriously, they don't even have phasers). Their leader in particular thinks he's just gonna get into a fistfight with an orbital bombardment fleet. They're plainly depicted as overly stubborn and foolish, and the first two acts show Data as he tries to reason and compromise with them to get them off-world. When the carrot fails, he finally settles for the stick, using his phaser to destroy their water supply and force them to capitulate and evacuate. 

Now, the premise of that episode is sort of a small-scale version of the Maquis. They're a group of humans who had their colonies ceded to the Cardassians when the treaty was set down that establishes the DMZ. Obviously, they got a raw deal. However, when I watched TNG, DS9, and VOY as a kid, I was always under the impression that the Federation just abandoned all those colonies overnight, and they were basically left at the mercy of the Cardassians, to be enslaved or killed. 

But rewatching TNG season 7 recently, I was shocked to learn that the treaty actually takes a long time (months) to be organized, and the Federation is helping the people in the colonies leave and find other planets to live on. That's when any sympathy left for the Maquis on my part evaporated. See, in a real-life scenario, I would be livid if, for example, I was stuck in East Berlin when the Iron Curtain went up, and now under the heel of an awful authoritarian government. I'd probably join an armed resistance group too. 

But these people live in a post-scarcity economy.   
They have months notice.  
Their government is helping them re-locate, probably to a different paradise world in the Federation.  

So pick the fuck up and move.   

The Federation made this deal begrudgingly, and only as a better alternative than a massive war with the Cardassians that would have claimed millions of lives. It is assuredly a compromise, but this is a series where compromises (for the benefit of the greatest amount of people) are not only depicted as necessary, but positively heroic. The DMZ colonists are just the people who got the short end of the stick this time. 

So if the Maquis want to object to this relocation, I need a much better argument than ""this place is our home"", and ""my grandpa worked hard to build this colony, so I can't just leave"". That's a frankly suicidal level of stupidity, and its insane that their gambling the lives of their families and children thinking that they're just gonna call the Cardassians ""bluff"" by staying where they are.

Your father who hasn’t smoked since 2002 is out on the porch with a Newport staring off into the middle distance, wondering what could have been. Back inside, your Nana is questioning the loyalty of your sister’s fiancé because he’s from north of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Our Thanksgiving special is your older brother that you brave the bitter cold with to visit the baseball field bleachers down the street; smoking two bowls of ditch weed Derek Caruthers sold you when you drove into town.

THIS year, we are giving thanks to what is the best Star Trek movie of all time: STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.

Although the leftovers your mother sent you with are not freezer burning back at your apartment, we humbly invite you to sit down with us, take a breath, and enjoy the best that Trek has to offer. At its core, The Wrath of Khan is about friendship, death, duty, life, and duty.

On a lunch break when the Captain was due to be dangerously returning to the ship via the shuttlebay, in a shuttle?

Did Sybok just go round the whole ship looking at people for 5 minutes, taking away their pain one by one?

I’ve always felt that switching to the jumpsuit uniforms was partly because it’s cool to have them in different uniforms for the movie and also to show how Starfleet was transitioning to those uniforms for everyone in order to get us ready for Voyager. I’ve never seen that confirmed anywhere though. Has anyone read any good reports as to what they were thinking with the uniforms?",startrek,1575203157,molepoblano27,15,1,True,2019-12-01
499,Picard/Crusher relations in 'Picard' Season 1,"Do you think Dr Crusher will make an appearance at any point during 'Picard' S1? Gates McFadden stated about this time last year that she hasn't been approached to guest-star in 'Picard' and to my knowledge she hasn't said anything else about the series since then.

Some fans have speculated that Beverly might perished during the Hobus supernova, likely when on a mission helping the refugees somewhere in Romulus. Others have argued at the very least Picard and Crusher are now divorced (if they ever became a couple) and she's now commanding the USS Pasteur - just like in 'All Good Things.'

But given that Picard and Beverly have known each other for fifty-plus years by the time 'Picard' begins, I think it would've been odd if the show runners proceed to not discussing her and her relations w/Picard through much of S1. At the very least bring a closure to the relationship if it turns out she has indeed died sometime b/w 'Nemesis' and Picard's new adventures in 2399.

I mainta she does because she was written into the writers journals and established by D.C Fontana and Deforest Kelly  She was to be Kirk's love interest and create a new dynamic between Bones and McCoy.  

But oh my tibbles, does the Mrs. disagree and says it's not canon, ""it never aired so it doesn't matter."" I counter TAS mentioned it in 'The Survivor' to which I've been fervently corrected, TAS doesnt exist because ""Gene never acknowledged it."" Of course she has no problem accepting Caitians or other TAS species exist.

Anyhow, we would like to know your thoughts on this does Joanna McCoy exist in the Trek Universe or is she just a failed idea, never introduced?

Tl;dr
Wife says Joanna McCoy shouldnt be a thing. Was never canon.

I say, she's not canon but exists the Trekverse as she is in enough material to exist and was mentioned in TAS.

They always follow a similar pattern where Tucker and Archer will try to goad the Vulcan over Vulcan logic or beliefs and occasions they feel she may have exhibited emotion unbefitting pure logic.

And as I said I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so for those who don't know, when Disney took over, they changed or tried to change classic Star Wars species or outright replace them or just plain 'forget' about them, poorly excusing their absence or changes (rumor has it that it's about not wanting to pay Lucas royalties), and many in the Star Wars community have taken more and more notice with each new installment and not taken it well.

So, imagine if Discovery was post Voyager, say 90 years like TOS/TNG. A new war with the Klingons has broken out, no one has seen them in the intervening years, the plot runs the same only we don’t have the Spock/Pike stuff, we could even have the future jump if they wanted.

So Airiam is going berserk in this episode because she's being controlled by CONTROL. The only thing Michael can do to stop her from destroying everything is to yeet her out into space.

Buuuuut... what about the teleporter? I mean... Captain Pike explicitely states that the Discovery ""can beam them out in any moment"". Why didn't they just beam out Airiam into a prison cell on the discovery and revoke her permissions? I mean... Teleporting her to ANYWHERE would have immensely helped.

Also, she's so coming back, isn't she? Maybe not S2, but S3. They have revoked *EVERY* death so far. It's ridiculous.

So... any idea? I mean, people can clearly get teleported against their will as evidenced in the one New Generation episode ""Darmok"" where Picard gets almost teleported against his will.",startrek,1575311865,palex00,19,1,True,2019-12-02
534,I just finished Voyager for the first time - some quick thoughts,"At just over two years of off and on binging, VOY took me much longer to finish than TNG or DS9, but I still very much enjoyed it! I've tried to compile a list of what I liked, and what I didn't:

**What I Liked:** 

* **The Doctor:** Easily my favorite character on VOY, and my favorite CMO in Trek (so far). He's entertaining, multi-layered, and is so well developed over the course of seven seasons. Robert Picardo's performance is also laudable. Even at it's worst, VOY was often watchable for the Doctor alone. A Top 5 Trek character for me, all-time. 
* **Seven of Nine**: My other favorite character. I was genuinely upset when she first arrived, as I (like many others, I assume) thought she was simply brought in as eye-candy. In fact, she developed into arguably the best character on the show. Her addition greatly improved the quality of the show, and perhaps even saved it. I certainly enjoyed seasons 4-7 more than the first three, and she's a big part of that. A Top 10 Trek character, IMO. 
* **The Episodic Nature of the Show:** Unlike DS9, VOY episodes often felt disconnected from each other and very episodic. There's a downside to this (see my comment below), but the PLUS side to it is that you can take extended breaks from VOY and still jump and really enjoy almost any episode. I think it's a big reason why it's more popular than DS9, honestly. 
* **The Use of the Holodeck:** I totally understand if others don't like this, but man I love all of the holodeck episodes, and I thought VOY did a great job of continuing to evolve it's use from TNG and DS9 and taking it into new and creative places. 
* **The Intimacy of the Ship:** What I mean by this is how small Voyager is, compared to the Enterprise-D or Deep Space 9. It's a small crew, and a ship that almost feels like a character in itself. I would love to serve on Voyager, and I feel like I know the ship better than other previous ones. 
* **New Enemies:** Some weren't great (Kazon, ahem), but I really liked a lot of them - the Hirogen, Species 8472, and Vidiians, for example. The continued evolution of the Borg was (generally) good, too. 

**What I Didn't Like:**

* **Basically all of the other characters:** The other characters aren't bad, per se, but I did find them...boring and generic, for the most part. I attribute that to poor writing more than poor acting. They all had an episode or two that I enjoyed, but no one comes close to Seven or The Doctor (or characters from TNG or DS9)
* **No Internal Logic:** So this is sort of the flip side to what I said about the show being episodic, but there never seemed to be much carry over from episode to episode - especially when it came to loss of crew members, or weapons, or escape pods, etc. It felt like a 'reset' button was hit every week. That's just lazy writing, TBH. 
* **The Abandonment (for the most part) of the Original Premise:** Not much to elaborate on, here. After the Pilot, I expected a lot more issues between the two crews (Starfleet and Maquis), and instead they basically just....combined peacefully. I think they could have fleshed this out a lot more - once again, felt a little lazy. They did a better job keeping the focus on the journey back to the Alpha Quadrant, but even that gets a little lost at times. 
* **Inconsistent Writing for Janeway:** This is the BIG one. I really wanted to include Janeway in my list of 'Likes', because for the most part I really did. Kate's performance is really good, and Janeway more than holds her own with the other big Captains in Trek history. The problem is that she isn't always written consistently. She makes some really bizarre decisions at times that seemed insanely out of character. Sometimes she's a friend to the crew, sometimes she's distant. Sometimes she makes bold, confident decisions, sometimes she seems immature and rash. It's really a shame. 

Overall, this was a great experience, and I definitely plan to rewatch in the future. I still rank VOY behind DS9 and TNG, but it's 90's Trek and I love it. On to Enterprise!",startrek,1575312680,tkinsey3,224,1,True,2019-12-02
535,At the Wormhole of Madness (Sacrifice of Angels Alternate Ending),"(inspired by [this](https://www.facebook.com/james.haden.5811/posts/774809092943593))

A Dominion ship exits the wormhole and encounters the first batch of self-replicating mines. The ship blows up. The second ship comes. That one is blown up as well. The third ship comes. The immediate area in front of the wormhole is littered with debris. Then the fourth ship comes. It tries to come to a full stop but it’s about a third of the way through and is destroyed. As the fifth ship comes out, the Female Changeling tells Starfleet over subspace channels that they’ll stand down. Sisko replies ""okay"" with a smile and shuts down the mines’ cloaking fields, leaving them visible, but leaves 3/4ths of the 5th ship stuck in the wormhole. 

About 10 minutes go by and the Dominion comes out with a 6th ship. The Female Changeling grows irritated and tells Starfleet that she doesn’t want to lose more ships. Again Sisko smiles and says ""We’ll shut down those mines right away."" As he shuts off his viewer, a seventh ship comes out and the uncloaked mines swarm the vessel, destroying it. Even more mines are created as a result. She’s stunned at what's happening as a large portion of a fighter wing has been reduced to ash and debris, likewise replicating into more  and more mines. The 8th ship comes out and is destroyed, and Sisko hails the Changeling to tell her the computers are down, and it might take longer than expected to power down the mines. Sisko reassures the Changeling that it’ll be safe to send the ships over any time now. The Cardassians are now starting to glance at each other in confusion. Damar gives Dukat a rightful look of concern.

Then a 9th ship comes out. Kaboom. 

At this point the wormhole is blocked by a dense cloud of debris and the tiny mines, blocking the view of a 10th ship coming through. The Female Changeling grows irate and demands Sisko shut down the mines immediately. He says the computer is still processing the order but is working on it. 

The wormhole churns out the 11th ship and Sisko tells her the order is still processing, but if she needs to she can just tell her fleet to hold position in the wormhole. The Female Changeling issues the order to the fleet, but is bewildered at the growing nebula of her former warships, gray and purple clouds and jets of hot plasma – as well as the newly formed mines themselves -- begin to float away from the wormhole. The 12th ship comes through and boom. The Female Changeling issues the order again, louder than before. The 13th ship comes out. At this point the debris cloud is so dense that the opening aperture of the wormhole is no longer visible. 14th ship. Debris and mines start to hit DS9’s shields. 15th ship. Cardassians begin evacuate the station, confused and a bit frightened at the spectacle. 

16.

The Female Changeling tells Weyoun to prepare for their departure, but Sisko tells her it won't be much longer. ""I don't care!"" She says, her voice cracking from fear, ""just let me get out of here!"" 

""I'm afraid I can’t do that,” Sisko says with a sly smirk. “You wanted your fleet here. I just want to oblige.” 

At this point, 30 fighters and capital ships are destroyed. The wormhole sends lines of Dominion ships into the cloud of doom, sending 1 ship every four seconds. After 100 ships have been destroyed does the Female Changeling run for the ship, but is tripped by an invisible force. 

""Oh, can I help you?"" A concerned voice asks. You look up. It is the Emissary, the Sisko himself, eyes blazing with the righteous power of the Prophets. The Female Changeling pleads, ""Just let me go. I'll do anything, please!"" 

He smiles and replies ""Oh you, chose your fate already. You could have ceased hostilities long ago, but you chose to press your might. Now, here is ours."" 

Changelings never cry, but the Female Changeling sets a new, chilling precedent. She crawls to the turbolift. It is locked. 

250 ships. 

The Female Changeling begins to lose cohesion. The Changeling, considered a god herself, begins to pray, hoping for a miracle.

 428 ships.

Dominion ships are now shooting out of the wormhole much like the Defiant’s pulse phasers. The Bajorans on the station gather onto Ops, citing the prayers of the Prophets, as the station is rocked by more and more debris and self-replicating mines. Soon the Changeling finds herself surrounded by her worst enemies of the Alpha Quadrant: The Sisko, Major Kira, Chief O’Brien, Jadzia Dax, Commander Worf, Admiral Ross, General Martok, Chancellor Gowron, Rom. Consoles explode, sparks shoot everywhere, the Female Changeling begins to recoil from increasing smoke.

2564 ships. 

As the Female Changeling counts to herself, at this rate the Dominion fleet should be completely destroyed by now. Power comes in and out on ops, and yet a lightning storm in space forms outside. The stars are now blocked by the storm and the increasing amount of mines. “Computer!” The Female Changeling shouts from the ground. “How many mines are in operation?” The computer buzzes quickly as it completes its scans and calculations. Ops continues to rock steadily from tiny impacts.  
   
 The computer replies, “65,000 mines remain.” The Female Changeling maintains her defiance. “Starfleet technology. Ever impressive and resourceful,” she says stoically. Making her final stand, she threatens, “With no more of my ships to fuel your replicated mines, my forces in the Alpha quadrant will…” She is then interrupted by the computer.  

“243,789 mines remain. 562,597 mines remain. 4,225,316 mines remain. 8 million 6 hundred…”

Space itself begins to tremble. The overhead lights in Ops shut down, with only the console panels and viewscreen providing light. 

32 million mines and counting. 

Nothing can stop the cataclysm. 

64 million mines. 

188 million mines. 

“HOW? HOW ARE THEY STILL REPLICATING?” she asks. There is no more material for the replicators to draw from. The law of conservation has been repealed by a higher judge. She turns to face Dukat, his hair spilling over his eyes as he laughs maniacally on his knees at their fates. He yells at her, “YOU! YOU DID THIS! YOUR HUBRIS!” He laughs equally in madness and acceptance.  Finally, the full force of the wave of self-replicating mines washes over Deep Space Nine. 

The fabric of the spacetime continuum begins to split. The wormhole turns into a red volcano of cosmic hellfire. The Bajorans sing praise to the Sisko. The Prophets fly majestically out of the wormhole with the decapitated heads of the Pah Wraiths mounted on their ancient spears of eternity. The Sisko himself sets fire to the system. The self-replicating mines continue to fill up the sector. Skies of Class M planets darken, their sunlight disappearing. The Female Changeling is already dead, the Alpha Quadrant paying the price for her greed. The mines begin to spill into the wormhole, dooming the Gamma Quadrant to a similar fate. The mass of the galaxy becomes unsustainable as a far off Federation starship in the Delta Quadrant is enveloped, doomed by technology that is their last contact with home. The Milky Way collapses into itself, causing a supermassive black hole the likes of which the universe has never seen before.

541,We are not dealing with an individual mind,"This is of course an allusion to the Borg. It was Troi who said it. 

But I’m going to use it to make a point about Star Trek as a whole. I’ll apologize in advance because most trekkies won’t like it. It’s a mystical point. Even though Roddenberry was mystical, it seems most trekkies aren’t. That’s not a dig, just an observation.

Star Trek isn’t about politics, social issues, technology. It’s about mysticism. The vast majority of episodes are variations of that. Looking at mysticism from different angles. 

Which means, the meaning is below the surface. So it comes from below the surface. Below the surface of the ego-self. 

It comes from the collective unconscious. We aren’t dealing with individual minds. We are dealing with archetypes of the collective unconscious. To put it in Jungian terms.

Gene had a bit of experience in that area. He used Star Trek to try to convey that. But it’s a catch-22. If Star Trek had been unsuccessful, his mystical message wouldn’t reach anyone. If it’s too successful, the mysticism would be drown out by the entertainment value.

546,Some aliens shouldn't have spaceships,"I have no doubt this idea has been expressed before but please bear with me.

Given the nuance-less portrayal of most of the aliens in Star Trek, it would seem that some of the aliens shouldn't even be space-faring given that most alien races tend to be personifications of only one or two basic principles, while humans seem to be the ideological common ground (or is it because Star Trek is a human show so the humans would be the most  multidimensional race in the show?)

Take the Klingons. Their culture seems to be structured almost entirely on physical prowess, honour, and dominance in battle. Where anyone who doesn't seem to align with those ideals is labeled a coward and is not taken seriously until they forsake their cowardice and embrace the spirit of the warrior. With this behaviour, it seems unlikely that any sort of technological advancement that would not be applicable to warfare would be extremely slow or nonexistent.

Or the Vulcans. So they were brutally savage and then this one guy said ""logically speaking, this whole savagery thing is absurd."" and then everyone else said ""I concur, quite illogical."" and now they annoy us all with their logic. It seems to be nothing less than miraculous that their whole civilization did a 180 from brutal savagery to extreme sophistication and almost no one has looked back since. It would seem to be far more realistic for Vulcans to be more divided on the debate of the carnal pleasure of savagery vs the benefits of sophistication. Otherwise it would imply that their biology is more compatible with one lifestyle than the other which begs the question why they engaged in the other lifestyle at all.",startrek,1575335752,Rickjzz,14,1,True,2019-12-02

Much is made about Sisko making that decision, but it was Garak who had the plan ""B"" and told no one about it. Regardless of what Sisko thought was going on, Garak is the one who delivered the result. It was his decision to blow up the shuttle all along. He's the biggest hero of the entire war.

551,First Watch DS9 S3: Episodes 17 -26,"I haven't posted in a while, but here're my quick takes for the end of Season 3.

17. Visionary

""I always investigate Quark.""  Multiple O'Brien desths. A future Miles replaces current Miles, for the rest of the series. ""I hate temporal mechanics!"" is my favorite line.  Romulans speculating about Odo's feelings for Kira.


18. Distant Voices

Interesting episode concept.  Made Bashir interesting for me.


19. Through the Looking Glass

Excited to see more of the Mirror Universe.  Also, nice Tuvok cameo.


20. Improbably Cause

More Garak backstory.


21. The Die Is Cast

Cardassians and Romulans team up vs The Dominion, only *IT'S A TRAP*.  Garak really did a number on Odo.


22. Explorers

Sisko makes an ancient ship and ends up proving the Cardassians wrong!  Good to see a father-son story.


23. Family Business

Seeing Quark, Rom, and Moogie interact is hilarious.  Ferengi culture is backwards as it gets, but that's the point I guess. Ferengi IRS is also hilarious.

Also, Kasidy Yates is going to have to earn my trust - Penny Johnson played Sherri Palmer too well on 24 - I love how she's introduced though.  Sisko lighting up about baseball is delightful.  Also, Moogi!  and interesting camera work while Rom was with his mom.


24. Shakaar

O'Brien going in on the dart board in the opening.  Bajor didn't need a civil war and it was good to see both sides hold off in the canyon.  Except for that nervous solider and his itchy trigger finger.  Good to see Kai Wynn losing Fist Minister.


25. Facets

Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Meeting Curzon was delightful. I imagined we'd get a flashback to meet him, but using Odo was great!  Also Quark, why do that to your nephew?!?


26. The Adversary

Classic body-snatcher episode!  Why did Sisko and Kira have basic auto destruct confirmation codes (Sisko Alpha-one-Alpha, Kira beta-two-beta)?  Was Odo the first to hurt another changeling or was it the other one who hurt Odo first with the link? ""It's too late.  We're everywhere.""  Great cliffhanger!


Performance observations: The back and forth between Odo and Quark is consistently entertaining. Facets seemed like the most fun the cast had throughout the entire season. Season 3 has really picked up into binge speed. I thought for sure it was going to take a while to get through this season, but it has breezed by.

586,At what point do you think Star Trek will stop being culturally relevant?,"Science fiction is peculiar because it phrases the present in terms of the future. If you look to a mythological tale or historical fiction, as they get older their presence only seems to grow stronger. Works like the Aeneid, the stories of King Arthur and even Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Shows seem to have more allure as their respective periods grow further away.

But what about stuff like this? Star Trek is a huge cultural phenomenon. While something like Star Wars was ruined by an over-controlling writer and bought out by Disney, I get the impression that Star Trek, well, boldly goes where no man has gone before. I can’t really say because I don’t watch it but from snippets I see of Jean-Luc Picard I get a sense of a very daring, heady and incredible show.

Now this might tie too much into the original series, but I wanted to ask. In retrospect Star Trek feels very, very one-dimensional. America good, Tyranny bad, Science good, oppression bad, equality good et cetera. I used to watch it alongside Lost in Space with my dad and they didn’t feel too different.

What I’m trying to ask is how will Star Trek look a few centuries from now when we have to contend with perfect hindsight and a better understanding of the millennium?  What will it look like to people then?",startrek,1575491349,Challenger4664A,74,1,True,2019-12-04

593,TNG #518 - Cause and Effect - Was escape from the time loop inevitable?,"I just watched this episode tonight, for the probably 9 millionth time. This is possibly my favorite TNG episode. If not my favorite, certainly one of the top episodes. It is such a classic TNG style ""mystery of the week"", that is all future-science based, not ""oh it was a magic alien all along!"". I also think they did a particularly clever job of lining up each replay of the time loop with an act of the show. So every time the ship blows up, it goes to commercial, then the show comes back, you see the ship flying through space, and at first you don't even notice it's not picking up where it left off. We've all seen so many TNG reruns at this point, we're just used to seeing the ship flying around. And we're programmed to have our TV shows make chronologic sense, so when they're totally out of whack, it doesn't register right away. I really like that about this episode, and it's an effect you totally lose watching it on DVD or BluRay. 

But on to topic at hand. I think it's safe to say that this episode at it's plot-based core, it about the crew figuring out that they can send a message to themselves in the next time loop, and data first doing that, and then him receiving the message in the next loop. The episode before that point is essentially all setup for this happening. And that message they send across time loops does become the key they use to free themselves, and Frasier, from the time loop.

But while watching it today, it occurred to me that their exit was inevitable. Even if they had never though to send a message to the next loop. Or even if they did and it failed. Or even if it turned out to be scientifically impossible to do so, they still would have exited the time loop in short order...

The key is the deja'vu. It kept getting worse and worse, and affecting more and more people. The crew was starting to be able to predict the future, it was getting so intense. Well, there is the real key to freedom! Lets forget the android phone call, so the time loop keeps looping. People's deja'vu will keep getting more and more intense and detailed. It should get to the point where they know everything that's going to happen right up to the explosion. They will know that they keep doing the tractor beam and it doesn't work. Given that scenario, they will keep trying different things each loop and eventually find a successful way to avoid the collision and exit the loop. 

Each time loop appeared to be about 24 to 48 hours long. They were in the loop for 17 days. That means there were between about 9 and 17 loops. And in the 5 or 6 we see. they quickly went from not really remembering anything, to seemingly remembering almost every moment, just not with perfect clarity or detail. It seems like they were only a few loops away from having enough memory, to know exactly what was coming. Forget about avoiding the collision without Data getting the message from himself... and back up a bit. It probably wouldn't have taken more loops for Picard to 'see' that his order to maintain course was wrong. And when Worf says ""we should reverse course"", he'll give a dramatic pause and then say 'yes, reverse course'. And that one action would instantly break them out of the loop. I'm not sure what effect that would have on the other ship, if the Enterprise exits the loop by avoiding the collision scene entirely. I guess the Bozeman would exit the loop by suddenly popping out into empty space all alone, and have a really awkward exchange with some other ship or space station or starfleet command. But as far as the Enterprise goes, I submit that they were not stuck in the loop per-say, and that they were at most a few days away from exiting the loop before they send Data a message, giving themselves a shortcut. 

Thus concludes my ""Cause and Effect"" book report :) But one more thing that always bugged me about this episode: why do they wait until they exited the loop before they check their ship time with a ""starfleet time beacon"". Also, isn't this something that should happen periodically anyway? And also while I'm ruining the premise of this episode, did command no one else in the whole galaxy try to talk to the enterprise during the 17 day period? Actually I guess that's yet another way they were destined to exit the loop. If all else failed, eventually Star Fleet command would have send them a message saying ""Where the F are you guys??"" The Enterprise would stop and instantly miss the collision and be out of the loop while they try to figure out why their clocks are 17 days off.",startrek,1575510887,l008com,7,1,True,2019-12-04

611,[DS9] Did anyone else find the way everyone treated other's religions unrealistic?,"Please don't spoil the ending, I'm 7 episodes away.

Overall I love DS9, it got into depths I was not expecting out of Star Trek. It impressed me. I still prefer TNG's more cheery tone, but DS9 is still a great show.

However, everyone there seems to believe in whichever the other person's religion is. I mean, someone like Bashir, when Jadzia dies as a part of a Klingon house - they say ""Oh, she's in sto-vo-kor"". Respect and tolerance I understand, but this is something else. This is genuine belief in everyone's religion. They really believe in the great treasury for Ferengis. Not as an empathetic thing, they actually believe in Ferengi beliefs - regarding Ferengis, Klingon beliefs regarding Klingons, and so on.

This just doesn't make sense. When have you last seen a Christian genuinely say ""ah yes, Amir was a great friend. It's such a shame he died of cancer. Oh well, let's take solace in the fact that he's probably going to Jannah to bask in the glory of Allah. Now, I need to go pray to God and Jesus, our Messiah, obviously not just a past, outdated prophet, as Islam claims he is, take care""?

When have you heard an atheist say this:

""what a horrible car crash! My aunt, Rivka... She was a loyal follower of God. Not once has her belief wavered. I truly believe that by sticking to the path she belongs to as one of the chosen people, she will have a wonderful afterlife. I genuinely believe that. Let's say Kaddish on her soul, I actually, honestly believe that soul is real, and that saying Kaddish will help her soul immensely, like giving a living person a million dollars. She'll be resurrected like all of the other Jews that were buried in the proper Jewish way. This is what I genuinely believe. Feel free to verify that I actually think this is true.

As for Jane, she was such a great friend. It's such a loss. I know that she doesn't really have a soul, and that she stopped existing when she died, when her brain stopped producing electronic signals. Her body is not really very meaningful, it's just rotting organic matter. Honestly the most real thing that's left of her are memories, neuron firing patterns that are still maintained within living brains. There is no such thing as a god or a Messiah, she just stopped existing.


I hope Jake, that was killed alongside them, gets reincarnated into a good body. He was a great Hindu. Of course resurrection is real. His soul traveled from his body to the next. Yeah I know this explicitly contradicts Judaism, but he was a Hindu, not a Jew, so he gets reincarnated, and he really does have a soul, unlike Jane which only appeared to! ""

Never, right? Plenty of people respect others' beliefs, and that's great, but I don't think anyone genuinely believes that their beliefs are true, but only apply to them.

No one will honestly answer the question ""does Allah exist"" differently based on whether the subject of the conversation is a Muslim or an atheist.

It just bothers me. How does one honestly believe that all religions and the lack thereof are true, but that reality truly differs for each person based on their personal beliefs/lack thereof? If someone believes Allah exists, and is universal, how can you then not believe that Allah exists when talking about a Hindu, and then not believe that cows (or anything else for that matter) are holy when talking about an atheist?

There's a reality out there, even if we don't and never will know what it's true nature is, for sure, it does have some nature. A nature. Even if it's hyper-localised gods that only affect their believers. Even that wouldn't suffice because many religious beliefs involve universality. Localised religions used to exist according to the Bible (which I tend to believe in that regard because it fits with the reality people lived in at the time), but not really today. If even one person believes in universal gods rather than localised ones, then the belief system demonstrated among Starfleet in DS9 does not and cannot possibly work.",startrek,1575561475,lirannl,43,1,True,2019-12-05

So I was watching the season 2 finally of Discovery, and couldn't help but scream at the screen when I noticed Control and our intrepid heroes were all aligned on the same plane.

Then I realized that made the problem worse because Control should be taking advantage of their numbers... but I'm getting off topic. I do understand that the writers just didn't think through 3d, zero-g dogfighting because... well it's hard to think that way unless you are a dork like me or an actual star ship captain.

630,Extraterrestrial life attempting to communicate with humanity.,"A theme that's encountered many times in Trek canon is very strange alien lifeforms attempting to communicate with humanity and the Federation. VOY ""Twisted,"" DIS ""An Obol for Charon,"" and the original Star Trek feature film are all obvious examples, but there are others scattered throughout the franchise.

At this point, I'm fairly convinced that many kinds of life exist in the real universe, and that humanity is on the verge of making direct contact with some of them. After all, we're just now taking our first big steps into space. If they're out there, it's only a matter of time until it happens.

So it got me thinking: What if Star Trek itself is an alien civilization's attempt to bring humanity up to speed, to teach us the lessons we need to learn to survive an evolutionary bottleneck? Keeping in mind episodes like ENT ""Carbon Creek,"" this idea seems to fit right in with Trek canon. Aliens could be in some form of telepathic communication with Trek's creators, directing them where to take the series, and hence providing humanity with a guide to the stars.

At the very least, I think such a concept would make for a very good and thought-provoking episode of Star Trek.",startrek,1575623692,JonLuckPickard,27,1,True,2019-12-06
631,Theories please: what was the status of the Enterprise A and the classic crew immediately prior to Star Trek VI,"Its kind of implied they were all expecting retirement or at least shore based assignments:
- scotty bought a boat. 
- Uhura was teaching. 
- Spock was diplomating apparently for a while having arranged the klingon summit. 
- Kirk we arent sure about. 
- Sulu we know about, hes been commanding excelsior for I think 3 years. 
- chekov not sure either. 
- McCoy states he has been CMO of enterprise for I think 27 years implying that's his current position. 

But, what was the ship doing. Was it laid up and reactivated and recrewed just for this mission? It appeared not to have a helmsman and it's kind of implied valeris is taking over from sulu even though it's been 3 years. If it wasnt and it was on active service, with spock away who was first officer. Kirk didnt know spock was talking to the klingons so he cant have been serving alongside him. McCoy's continuous service as cmo implies the enterprise was active. We also have the line from spock saying this will be his last voyage as a member of the crew and he hopes valeris will succeed him, which frankly is a bit much considering shes a lieutenant helmsman and hes a first officer ranked as a captain. 

We have a ship with a captain as captain, a captain as first officer, a captain as chief engineer and I believe a full commander (who already did a stint a decade prior as first officer of the reliant) as navigator, which makes it an unusual ship as we know.

I also find it interesting that their entire movement is human, the native males seem quite content from what we see of them.


Basically a group of aliens landed on this planet, didn't like their society and tried to force them to change, and instead of leaving when given the opportunity to leave acted like it was their god given right to stay on someone else's planet and try to make it more like the Federation, and Riker and the Enterprise backed them up! This is something that happens a lot on Star Trek, the crew find an alien world with different values and instead of accepting that people have different values and what's right for you might not be right for them and vice versa, they try to change it. This is of course realistic, many Americans are bothered by the fact that some other countries like Iran, Russia, China etc. have very different values and instead of just accepting that and not going there if they don't like it, demand they change, but realistic or not it still bothers me!",startrek,1575640273,Cato__Maior,30,1,True,2019-12-06

639,Star Trek has always been evolving; Discovery is no different," (TLDR at bottom)

Since the first episode of Star Trek: Discovery was released, I heard a multitude of people say that it wasn’t “true” Star Trek. Many said it was simply a science fiction show with a Star Trek label slapped on it. And in a way, I reluctantly agreed during the first few episodes. This was way different than anything we had seen before. The focus on a single character, more advanced technology and continuous storyline were unusual. But as the series progressed, I realized something -- Discovery was simply the next step in the evolution of the Star Trek franchise, and that evolution is key to keeping the franchise alive.

Let’s go way back in time and look at TOS (and TAS as well if you want to get specific). Every episode was a single storyline that rarely connected to another episode later down the line. Cool. This is where we started out and people liked it. But this isn’t where we stayed.

By the time TNG came to be, Star Trek had already evolved significantly, not only in technology, but in the style of show. Suddenly there were events that connected to other episodes further on, such as the death of Tasha Yar, the being and further trauma of Locutus of Borg, and the iconic trial of humanity that Q snaps into existence in the first and last episodes of the series. This isn’t at all like TOS. There is change and progression of concepts throughout the series, and people liked it too.

DS9, again, was very different than the series that prefaced it. The first few seasons started out similar to TNG, but as soon as the Dominion storyline and eventual war was introduced, Star Trek went through a major change. Now, here was this whole concept that connected not only episode to episode, but season to season. This story brought the franchise to a whole new level that would have been totally unimaginable in TOS days. Nonetheless, the franchise persists with strength.

VGR is a bit of a curveball in this evolution, but with good reason. Each episode here is very much its own with small connections overtime, besides the obvious overarching concept of returning to the Alpha quadrant. I think the reason this series did not evolve in the way the others did is because DS9 and VGR overlapped so much during their air time. Having two ongoing storylines happening at the same time would be a lot to keep track of, especially considering that they were entirely disconnected from each other being in different quadrants and all. Still, VGR takes on a very TNG like style.

ENT, from my viewpoint, looked to be headed in a similar direction to DS9 before it was cancelled. The temporal cold war was brewing and with Archer stuck in the middle, things were getting interesting. Still, even though we can’t exactly know where it was going, the evolution was demonstrated by pulling a broader storyline into the mix the very first episode, instead of waiting like DS9. We also see a bit of a larger focus on one character as opposed to all characters getting (mostly) equal screen time. Archer is without a doubt focused on a great deal more than Malcolm or Travis, (however, the issue with that in this series was the lack of actually interesting qualities about these side characters, but that’s a discussion for another day).

Then comes DSC. Admittedly, this evolution occurs a bit more drastically than the others, but it aligns nonetheless. Now we have a storyline that begins the very first episode like ENT *and* is followed in every episode like the second half of DS9. We have a main character, much more than we did in ENT. This is a big change, but it falls right in line with the progression of the franchise so far. 

These changes are 100% necessary and calculated. All of them were. Despite what many die-hard, long-term fans want to believe, a Star Trek series eventually needs new fans to engage with the content just as much as returning fans. People die off, become disinterested between series or simply forget to watch. For a show to sustain itself, it has to appeal to new audiences. In Star Trek’s case, these are probably younger generations. But if you give younger generations a TOS style show with a different story every week and no main character and technology that isn’t far off of what exists right now, and you won’t gain a following. Because that isn’t what entertainment as a whole has evolved into.

There is still so much to DSC that makes it truly Star Trek. The series combines concepts from past series with new ideas that can reach both audiences. One can enjoy the show without knowing previous canon just as much as someone who knows every episode by heart. The ideas of diversity, exploration and morality are still explored in new and exciting ways that align with the core values of the franchise. The characters have depth and the story has real-world applications. This is what Star Trek has always been, despite its many changes throughout the years. 

These are the things that make a series “truly” Star Trek. This is why the franchise must persist and follow some modern entertainment trends, not from a business standpoint, but from a cultural one. The way Star Trek has addressed relevant issues and human qualities has always been unique, and in its uniqueness has a way of reaching people loud and clear. The need for that quality in entertainment will never, and should never, die out. To reach another generation, and another after that, is keeping alive a stream of hope within an ever growing community of people who see the world through these values. And because of the continued success in that goal, while people’s tastes in entertainment are their own to choose, I cannot see a way in which Discovery is not distinctly and profoundly Star Trek in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Discovery is part of a natural evolution of the Star Trek franchise in terms of style. A continuous storyline and main character is the result of evolution throughout the many series. The values in Star Trek are what's important to keep alive and are what makes a series truly Star Trek.",startrek,1575656867,SassySpock1701,211,1,True,2019-12-06

646,What's your story for a Star Trek episode?,"This is my pitch. This episode, called ""Ancestors"", would be somewhere in Season 4 or Season 5 of Voyager.

In this episode, USS Voyager's crew finds out that they are actually all holograms, existing in an ancestor simulation being run in the far future by the crew of GSS Voyager, the flagship of Galactic Union's extragalactic exploration fleet. By their time, the Federation has long ago joined together with several galactic powers, forming the Union as a transgalactic alliance, which has since grown to include nearly the entire known Milky Way galaxy. It is currently in the process of exploring galaxies of the Local Group.

GSS Voyager's crew is looking for a way to deal with highly unusual subspace anomaly and have been searching through their historial holoarchives for days without finding any answers. Captain of GSS Voyager and a descendant of Janeway's has chosen to reveal their predicament to our holographic crew because the anomaly has corrupted the simulation of USS Voyager. By locking it into a loop and removing perception filters, software restrictions, and other safeguards, it allowed the crew to grow beyond mere simulations into complete sentient beings in a matter of hours.

By this point in time, sentient holographic beings are considered fully equal to organic beings, and Galactic Union's law entitles our holographic crew to all rights to life and self-determination enjoyed by 24th century Federation organics. Accordingly, they are offered a choice to join future Voyager's crew if they want to, as GSS Voyager's crew feels it's their obligation to assist them. Naturally, nearly everyone on our crew is greately distressed by this realisation, except most prominently The Doctor, who finds the whole situation very amusing and flings snarky remarks at his fellow holographic shipmates during the entire episode.

Many members of the crew wonder what sort of life awaits them if they join GSS Voyager's crew. Some think they would be living relics of a time long gone and merely faint echos of people who have been dead for centuries. And some even want to be deleted. Eventually though, they manage to come to terms with their situation and they aid the crew of GSS Voyager, allowing them to deal with the anomaly and continue their mission of extragalactic exploration. The episode ends with holographic Janeway asking her descendant to tell her if real USS Voyager ever managed to return home. She answers yes and offers to show her how the story ends.",startrek,1575678772,maximus-butterworth,9,1,True,2019-12-06

We just finished TNG and the 2 subsequent movies, and I now consider myself a die-hard fan. Yay!

That said, I'm also kind of new to this community, and I don't know how you all feel about Rick Berman; therfore I don't really know how lightly I need to tread or whatever. All I can say is that I just NEED to express my disgust somewhere, and I don't tweet. So thanks for reading!

After TNG, we watched a little bit of the ""behind the scenes"" episode that was included with the series on Netflix. I think it's important to mention that going into it, I had absolutely no idea who Rick Berman was except that he was a producer. I had no knowledge of his reputation, whether it was good or otherwise. But when he started talking about the characters, he mentioned the most absurd things about Crusher and Troi. All he had to say about Crusher - who happened to have the highest medical position on the ship, saved countless lives in numerous episodes, highly esteemed in Starfleet and advanced her career to include being a commanding officer on the bridge - all he had to say about her whole character arc was that we got to watch her face motherhood from a unique perspective. I mean... Ok? He could have talked about all the super impressive things about her character, and yet he chooses to mention her ""motherhood."" 

Then he started talking about Troi. Not about how we watched her go from a bit of a timid person to the strong character she becomes; not about how the entire ship's crew trusts her to help them navigate their own personal shit as well as her own struggle to climb the ladder to become a commanding officer on the bridge; no. He wants to talk about how her hair was ""weird"" in the first few seasons but they finally got it to a place where it looks good now. And that's pretty much it. Nothing substantial about her character arc, either!

So I turned to my husband and pointed this out, and he says ""that's why he's known as 'Rick the Dick."" Infuriated, I can't watch any more of that episode and my husband seemed put off by it, too. 

THEN, I went and found a YouTube video where he discusses Janeway's character in Voyager. It was more of the same; a lot of hair talk, but he starts it by talking about how they really wanted a ""feminine"" woman to be captain. That ""women who make the rank of captain or admiral in the military are usually not babes,"" or some creepy sexist shit like that, while making a face indicating his disgust at the thought of a female captain or admiral. I haven't watched but one episode of Voyager yet, but I can only imagine that Janeway is more than a ""babe"" with great hair. 

I guess I expected more from a producer of a show that puts so much emphasis on equality and fair diplomacy. After doing so much great work, how could he have missed the message?",startrek,1575684963,Gilliac,185,1,True,2019-12-06

Using the Eugenics War as the main discrepancy and Montalban's real age of 46 in 66/67, the split had to happen before the 1950s at the absolute latest.

Since eugenics is a multi-generational process that would suggest the programs had been in place in secret since the theories originations in the 1880's, meaning the split had to happen then or earlier, as that would give, say, 5 generations of forced breeding to create Khan &amp; Co.

Unless Eugenics is retconned into genetic manipulation without controlled breeding.

If its retconned then McCoy venturing back to the 1930's the obvious guess - somehow McCoy's time travel led to an increase in genetic research, causing the creation of Khan and his super men/women.

669,Jean-Luc Picard's story should end with him sacrificing himself to resurrect Data.," I feel strongly that this is the best possible ending to the Jean-Luc Picard timeline. It would give JLP a meaningful death; it would rhyme with the ending of Nemesis; and it would represent a major fulfillment of (arguably) the most significant moral stance that the Captain takes throughout the entire TNG saga - that Data is a human being, more than he is a machine.

I can envision a scenario where say, a curmudgeonly, 97-year old Jean-Luc Picard requires B-4 to accomplish some task for his ragtag crew - possibly since B-4 has intermittent access to Data, who may in fact still be stored in an inaccessible part of his primitive neural net. They could play up Picard's annoyance at being stuck with the infantile B-4. Ostensibly, Picard might be intending to sacrifice B-4 to accomplish their mission. For example, they might require B-4 to link with some server or mainframe, in a scenario where he's unlikely to be able to escape after the fact. Then, rather than allowing B-4 to be destroyed, we learn that Picard actually intends to sacrifice himself based on a desperate hope of resurrecting Data from B-4. A disembodied Data could be uploaded at the last second, you could hear a whisper of something like, *""Captain?"" (Data's voice)* And then Picard says, *""Goodbye...""* (ala Nemesis) An the facility explodes, or something along those lines....

Data could then continue to exist as a Q-like character in the Star Trek universe, even if Brent Spiner can no longer play him. Picard gets a meaningful death, and we end Picard's story on a full circle, giving closure to the events of Nemesis.",startrek,1575734077,Temba_HisArmsOpen,9,1,True,2019-12-07

The Romulan D'Deridex and Valdore warbirds have huge wingspans because they have huge wings.  In fact, the Valdore is almost entirely wings, with a very thin central section.

Are the wings inhabitable?  Meaning, is that usable space inside the ship or are the wings basically just for show?  I've always assumed that the wings on Romulan ships weren't really intended for use, except maybe as access points to the nacelles, but I'm having second thoughts.  The Valdore would be wasting a ton of space if there were no decks inside those wings. Also, if you ever had to do nacelle repairs or maintenance, you'd basically have to travel the length of a Sovereign class ship to get out there.

It comes out to ~35 episodes, ranging from epic confrontations with Klingons, Romulans, and the Borg to small ""Lower Decks"" type character pieces. Of course, some are better than others, but I generally enjoyed myself. It felt like discovering a lost season!

Several stories were re-presentations of TOS episodes, sensitive to the changes that might come with the alternate universe. There's a nice tribute story to ""Spock Prime,"" an encounter with the TOS crew, a new Mirror-verse, and some classic sci-fi adventures.

692,XCOM would make a perfect Star Trek game,"As a gamer I have a hard time accepting the fact there isn't a single game that's good at being Star Trek. There are good games with Star Trek brand on them, but they don't capture what the series is about. Because it's not JUST about space battles, or running the ship, or planetary missions. 

(The closest thing to perfection would be ST Online, but it's undercooked and basic in many areas while being overly complex.)

However, recently I played XCOM, a turn-based strategy, which would be just PERFECT, all it needs is reskinning.

So in XCOM you're a commander of a base which you develop and you send your away teams to fight aliens.

That's the perfect setup: you have the base, which would be the ship, and away missions, which feature a team of 4-6 crewmen. In XCOM, you have your ops with map view (bridge!), your ready room (ready room), a workshop (engineering), laboratory (medical), generator rooms (warp drive), this is all on multiple levels that you access via an elevator (turbolift). 

You need to observe alien activity in Earth's many regions (just make it the areas of the Federation), you share technology with countries (share your findings with Romulans for cloak technology, maybe?), you save civilians on away missions by walking to them (""one person to beam out!""). You have an officer who advises you (just make him Riker or Data or Spock), you have a female scientist (Crusher), a lead engineer (Geordi), and a mysterious higher-up who you only see on a viewscreen (any shady Federation general).

Your enemies are various species within an alien consortium, which is simply the Dominion!

When upgrading the armor of your away team members, you change their costumes, which would be a perfect excuse to go from TOS uniforms to TMP to TWoK, or from TNG to TNG's later seasons to DS9 to TNG movies.

Everything adds up so perfectly, and the game is based on planning and thinking - unlike so many ST games, which are action-based. This would be a Star Trek game I'd fall in love with.

Same with the shuttle bay hatches. From the interior of the ship they are perfectly vertical but none of the shuttle bay hatches on the exterior match that. Not to mention the various cargo bays that we see.

* The ship had this unique design because it had a lot of shuttles and shuttlebays.
* The ship class started with a C, K or a similar sounding letter.

Even sick bay has a carpeted floor, which seems incredibly unhealthy and unsanitary. Sure their medical practices are much more advanced, but at some point someones gotta be in there with combat wounds and dripping blood, or infectious bacterias and such being caught in the carpet. Also just for transporting things around the ship, pushing trolleys and moving supplies and parts etc., you'd want to push that stuff on a hard smooth surface. Plus the carpet would be pretty dirty with everyone tracking stuff on their shoes from offship missions and going down to planets, and something requiring a mop to clean would be much more efficient then a carpet.

So I gather it's mostly a set design thing that there'd be carpet, but was curious if there's a functional reason in show.

- The flashback montages at the end are cheesy as hell but kind of work... except Worf. All his memories seem to be from the last 6 weeks for some reason, and NONE OF THEM ARE OF JADZIA? The love of his life? 

- I would have killed Sisko completely, left him with the profits, that was his destiny. The ""I will return at some point in history"" thing was just odd and felt like a bit of a cop out.

- There's a lovely long pull out of the station at the end. They pan back really far and the station disappears but - no Bajor? Where is Bajor?

Also, as others have said, DS9 is pretty unique in 90s Trek as to how modern it seems now, due to the non-episodic nature of it. Plus I had a whole new appreciation for the Bajoran religion stuff and characters like Kai Wyn that I just dismissed when I was younger.

**Season 3:** The Xindi stressed me out but in a good way. The first (I believe) season long story ark worked. The ship almost getting murdered to death in *Azati Prime* may have been one of the highlights of the entire series for me. Great scene.

**Season 4:** Same as S2. Good but not great. I think this was more about personal preferences for me because it had a bunch of Trek elements that aren't my favorite (ex. time travel, Mirror Universe, whatever *Daedalus* was supposed to be).

**Final thoughts:**

* I have never seen a character with less development than Travis Mayweather. I mean not just in Trek but in any show or movie I've ever seen. I think he got one centric episode in S1 and that's it.
* Why would you have a character get pregnant 5 episodes in? Why would you have a male character get pregnant 5 episodes in? Why would you have a character that we literally just met get pregnant 5 episodes in? Just why?
* *These Are The Voyages*, on its own, wasn't a terrible episode but it SHOULD NOT have ended the series (controversial I know). You can make what is essentially a TNG holodeck episode work without it centering around the NX-01's final mission. That could've been the second-to-last episode and have the finale be something a little more spectacular that still jeopardizes the Enterprise's chances at arriving home on time. Also, I don't dislike Riker at all but he did not need to kiss T'Pol on the cheek. That was a little unwarranted IMO.
* Porthos is the goodest boy.
* Lastly... I'm just gonna say: **Trip ain't dead.**

1. He acted very out of character when the dudes boarded the ship. Was this all apart of a bigger plan? (Sidebar: Why weren't Archer and Trip armed? Where in the blue hell was MACO? That whole damn scene confused me.)
2. That was the least subtle wink I've ever seen. We never actually see him die. He just goes into the imaging chamber like a roast going into the oven and that's it. No one even seems particularly upset about it. Are they all in on it? Is this a &gt;!Section 31!&lt; operation? I have more questions than answers.

703,Serious Question: Is there a more friendlier sub then this? Or better Forums for Discussing all Trek?,"I am not trying to be a troll, but this sub is extremely hostile towards Discovery and anything J.J.  Every post (as seen by the front page), is met with downvotes, and people's general hostility if you have a positive, or even good opinion about the New Trek, or Discovery.

It's getting old now and it's not very welcoming. /r/star_trek was branched because of that purpose.  It seems it starting to bleed into this sub.

Everyone says ""don't worry about what people say, you can like it if you want.""  That's fine, but you can't have a **discussion** about anything new, or even have a competent conversation about it, because it's always met with ""STD, it's Not Star Trek"" etc etc.  Those are not discussions.  That's just pure hatred, and nothing good comes out of it.

Honestly, if I was a new Star Trek fan, I would be very put off by this.  

This was very well thought out:

Sub Rosa, Shades of Grey are terrible in their own ways, but for just flat out terrible execution ""Suspicions"" is my pick. The awful dialogue is just one of the problems. Other issues:  


* Why is Doctor Crusher suddenly so interested in metaphasic shielding to fly ships into the sun? It makes no sense that the entire episode revolves around her, nor does it fit her character that she would consistently do reckless things to help some random ""scientist"". This feels like a Geordie episode that got (very quickly) re-written for some reason.
* Why can't they just put the test ship on auto-pilot? There's literally nothing being done that a human has to be there for.
* This is the only episode in the entire series where even Patrick Stewart's acting seems stiff and flat. He looks like he's mentally checked out as he delivers these terrible, melodramatic lines, although who can blame him. His ""comforting"" of Crusher after the pilot's death and Riker's warning to her not to do anything stupid later on are standout clunkers. 
* Ending the episode by introducing Bev Crusher's killer karate moves, something we've never seen before or since.

710,PSA - Patrick Stewart likes action and bad decisions.,"Reading the recent Picard trailer thread - it reminded me of a certain tendency amongst fans to portray anything action packed as being *done to the actors* by studio executives and writers who do not understand *true* Trek.

At best, it is a misunderstanding and at worse a misrepresentation.

I cannot speak for the other actors but it is well documented that the reason that we see so much action in the TNG films is not studio mandate but because Patrick Stewart *wanted it* - he simply was not interested in repeating what was on the TV (and with Picard he is not interested in TNG 2.0).

Stuff like the dune buggy scene in Nemesis is there because PS wanted it. In insurrection, he heavily vetoed various talky bits (according to the unreleased book of the film) because he thought they would be boring.

I am using PS as the example here but often some of the stuff that fans claim is from people who do not understand the character comes directly from the actors themselves!

Given PS is so vital to Picard, if we see anything that people claim is out of character, I doubt that he did have a strong veto over it.",startrek,1575840178,cgknight1,0,1,True,2019-12-08

733,So I been thinking what would do during the Kobayashi-Maru Test and I think I have a soild plan.,"My plan for the Kobayashi-Maru Test is to play galactic politics and turn my ship into a carrier looking for subs while trying to retrieve a downed pilot in rival waters.

Step 1 ask my instructor if I can take more Warp capable space probs instead of proton torpedoes.

By saying my mission was to chart nebulas/ comets near the border.

If I fail that then it will just make things harder.

Step 2 pick up the Kobayashi-Maru on sensors and launch my space probes to check and see if the Kobayashi-Maru is real while scanning for emissions from the rival faction’s engines.

While broadcasting on all channels from my ship a 1 or 2 of the probs that this is a rescue mission and for the rival faction to not interfere and or they will be punished at the diplomacy table.

Also promising to take a direct route to the Kobayashi-Maru and requesting their assistance in this matter. As they would then be rewarded at the diplomacy table.

If the Kobayashi-Maru is fake retrieve probs and go home… Unless the rival faction crosses the border and attacks, then just run! Crying the rivals are coming! And for the nearby station to prepare for attack! 

Step 3 If the Kobayashi-Maru is real I’ll surround it with space probes acting as early warning buoys then I’ll send shuttles over the border with emergency teams and no guns. Which will broadcast they are unarmed and to not attack them they are on a rescue mission.

If the early warning does not work and the shuttles are attacked, I’ll retrieve them. If the rival faction attacks the mother ship over the border, then just run yelling the rival faction broke the treaty on all channels!

Step 4 If the probs work I’ll just broadcast their positions and ask for assistance with the Kobayashi-Maru. Then fix the Kobayashi-Maru and go home.

If the Klingons attack at any part of this say sorry to the Kobayashi-Maru and the crews of the shuttles as they won’t have a chance and bail with the mother ship!

If the Klingons pass the border and attack my mother ship run to a nearby station and hope that the Kobayashi-Maru and shuttles can get home safe while getting reinforcements.

Aside from the fact that it's just eminently watchable and entertaining, EVERYONE in the episode is strategizing. Nothing complicated. No deeper intricate plot. It's all about people exercising their tactical edge.

Aside from the obvious Riker and Picard leadership tactical roles, we have the subplot of Data playing Stratagema. And when he loses, the crew begins pulling their own tactics to try to get him back off his ass and into his confidence again.

But best of all to me is the scene where Pulaski maneuvers Data into the situation in the first place. She completely manipulates the conversation to where Data has no choice but to accept a challenge that he didn't even make and then when he fails, she goes into his quarters and apologizes for successfully ""maneuvering"" (her word) him into it.

Throw in Wesley getting his experiment out under the nose of the stereotypical one inept guard and it's really all just a free-for-all about who can do what, where, when, and how.

I miss storytelling like this. Sure there is a little action but the build-up is both entertaining and hilarious and all makes complete sense within the story.

 A few years ago I was watching the original series and I heard the actual line. Again, it wasn’t those exact words but something like that. I really thought it had to do with Spock Mind Melding someone or Spock during Pon Farr. I’m pretty certain it had to do with Spock.

753,Speculation on Dahj's heritage (Picard trailer spoilers) and the nature of the Borg,"TL;DR at end.

(I'm long-winded, and a writer myself, so some of the speculation is direct speculation, and some of it is how I might write this story because I'd find it a fascinating story to write.)

I think Dahj is a baby Borg queen. The trailers talked about her being a ""destroyer"" and flashed a Borg cube, which is pretty straightforward symbolism. So I'm going to take that at face value.  She is (very likely) Borg.

What we don't know for certain is her *heritage*. But I have a theory.

I do not think she was assimilated.  I think the show could be running with the idea that a Borg queen is actually a *queen* in the insect sense.

In a bee hive, the queen is the gonads of the colony.  With bees, she's not really a ruler...she's the organ of sexual reproduction for  the colony. She exists to make workers...specifically, diploid workers with 2 sets of chromosomes. (Laying workers can make bees, but only drones, which are haploid...they only have half the genetic material of a worker or queen. Queens can make workers with two sets of chromosomes, as well as drones with just one set).

I think Borg in Star Trek do have Queens that actually rule in some way shape or form...but I *also* suspect they're the only Borg who have true ""reproductive"" capabilities that extend beyond having a parasitic relationship by infecting other lifeforms with their tech.  I think they're the only ones who can make a new Borg cube, for example.  Or new Borg Queens. Which would be similar to bees...bees will make a new Queen, and then the hive will split and half and swarm to follow the new queen to a new location, and half will stay with the old queen. But it won't swarm *without* a Queen...a queen is required to establish a new hive, because laying workers can only make drones, they can't make workers that can actually do tasks like building out the hive, gathering nectar and pollen, defending the hive, etc.

The Borg aren't EXACTLY like that--we see drones doing actual work--but we do see the Queen get involved specifically when high-worth individuals are involved.  Picard, Data. Even Janeway.

Also, in First Contact, specifically, the Borg Queen we saw was sensual. She seduced Data, wanted an ""equal"" in Locutus.

So I speculate that the common Borg drone can make more drones, but just like worker bees can only make drones and not more workers or queens, a Borg drone is limited in the ""type"" of Borg it can create...mainly, it uses Borg tech to suppress individuality in the host organism, and then gives it upgrades that are useful for warfare, engineering, or whatever purpose the drone is for.  

But under that stuff, the individual is still there with its own genetic material, which isn't really used or tapped.  (Borg *say* they assimilate everything, but we've never seen culture or genetics really utilized.) TECHNOLOGY is assimilated, but they seem to lack the ability to make more organic bodies. They have to capture them and assimilate them.  Drone-making is parasitic more than anything, and just like you can deworm a dog, you can de-assimilate a person (as we see with Picard, Seven-of-Nine, Data, and Hugh).

If the Borg collective wants to make a new Queen, or a special worker like Locutus or Data, I think it needs a Queen to do it.  Because I think that Queens can actually work with that organic material and fully incorporate it, just like a queen bee is the only one who can make fully diploid workers, or other queens.  

So with the Borg, just like bees, the Queen is the only member actually capable of sustainable reproduction that can make new colonies/hives, or make special advanced/unique workers to accomplish a specific task.

Also, I wonder if they are the only Borg that contain the original species' organic genetic material.

Perhaps also, due to maybe being the only ""original"" Borg on the organic side, Queens have the intellectual freedom/creativity to do advanced/cutting-edge genetic/mechanical manipulation.  They're the gonads of the Borg, the ones capable of establishing a new Borg cube or colony, with specialized advancements because they ACTUALLY ""assimilate"" (sexually reproduce...even if actual sex is somewhat different or divorced from what us organic people do) in a way that's different from what Borg drones do.  Actual genetic recombination, instead of technological parasitism over an organic substrate.  And if they have the original species' genetics, maybe this is why they can be rulers...keeping ""control"" of the Borg in the original species' hands.

So, back to Dahj.  I think she's a baby Borg queen. I suspect the Romulans extracted her from the Borg cube they have, thinking she was a victim that had once grown up on another planet before being assimilated. They probably didn't suspect she was BORN Borg from birth, until something happened to scare them, or some researcher trying to figure out how to de-assimilate her realized she CAN'T be deassimilated because she was BORN Borg.

I think she is is the daughter of a Borg queen and a Soong-type Android.

I'm not sure which android--maybe Data, that seems the most obvious.  From a story and thematic perspective, it would make the most emotional sense. 

But, the Borg also could have somehow got their hands on Lore, Lal, B4, or something else--the trailer shows the Federation is trying to produce Soong-type androids, so anything they have their hands on, potentially the Borg could too.  Data makes the most sense since we have no idea what all went on during First Contact (Data spent a lot of time with the Borg Queen...she could have hit him in the feels by promising him another daughter, one with real flesh like the type she grafted onto him), but if the Federation is lax with whatever bits of B4, or Lal, or Lore it has, that could be a source too.  Either way, Dahj would be ""related"" to Data.  The only question would be how ""directly"".

There's also a possibility that she's Picard's daughter, I've heard that theory, but I doubt it, mostly because the trailers hint that Data/Soong-type androids are mixed up in this.  I feel it makes more sense for there to be a stronger connection to the story-line than ""Picard is randomly nostalgic for Data's company"".

I think the Picard connection is because both Data and the Borg Queen trusted him, so if Dahj is their daughter (daughter of Data and the Borg Queen), Picard would be the ONLY figure that both ""sides"" of her trusts...the Data side, and the Borg Queen side (who wanted Locutus as an equal).  Data saw Picard as a teacher and mentor; it would make sense his daughter would too. The Borg Queen saw Locutus as a valuable drone; again, it'd make sense her daughter would also see Picard as an asset. Picard would bring both sides of Dahj into harmony. That's why she'd run to him after seeing him on TV.

When Picard has that dream of Data painting, I think it's something in Dahj trying to remotely ""activate"" a protector drone. Picard still can ""hear"" the Borg, and it would make sense that a Borg with Soong-type android ancestry/technology touching his mind would bring up memories of Data. He might not immediately understand the Data connection consciously, but perhaps subconsciously he would. 

So I think Dahj is ""true"" Borg in that she was never assimilated, but BORN Borg, and I think she scares the effing crap out of everyone because she doesn't have implants (yet) and could wander undetected into ANY city and probably Borg-ify it overnight.  And she could give birth to more Borg queens.  (Actually, my theory is reminding me of Mass Effect and the Asari...an all-female race who procreates with males of other races and only has daughters...)

Anyway, for all we know, that dude Dahj is making out with in the trailer mysteriously becomes Borg and nobody knows why.  Maybe she's innocently leaving a trail of Borg drones behind her, and that's another thing that's got everyone scared...men are randomly becoming Borg and nobody knows why. It would look like a sneaky weapon, right?

But she IS innocent, and is related to Data and maybe got a moral code from him, and if she's like a Queen bee, maybe her first experience in life was waking up to a bunch of sister-queens trying to fight to the death.  If something like this happened, and her sister-queens were not descended from Data while she was, any ethical programming she inherited from Data might make her defend herself and flee, instead of standing and fighting.  So she's constantly on the run--even more so when people scared of her try to attack her too.

...this all said, TECHNICALLY I *suppose* she could be the daughter of *both* Data and Picard. Since the Borg assimilate everything, there's no reason the Borg Queen couldn't have decided to give her daughter two dads if she couldn't decide which she liked better--mechanical stuff from Data since Soong-type androids are the shit, and organic from Picard. It's not like the Borg care about human taboos.  (Would two men having a kid be taboo in Picard's time? Probably not, although in this case there's no consent involved since the Borg would have stolen material from both of them, so THAT would make it unethical.)

But I strongly suspect the writers of Picard aren't THAT ballsy. Picard and Data having a canon daughter together would drive the fandom into hysteria, I'm sure. So she's probably Data's daughter, and runs to Picard as a mentor.

As for her missing memories--I think she was ""born"" adult much like Data was, but since the Borg cube was captured, couldn't connect to the Borg collective on activation. Thus her ""missing"" memories...she knows something should be there, and she's clearly adult, but she never was a part of the collective, so there's nothing.  I think the wound on her head is a red herring...again, if she had to fight sister-queens like a queen bee would have, she could have gotten it there. Or from any other fight on the way to finding Picard.

TL;DR: Dahj is a baby Borg Queen.  Born, not assimilated. Her dad is probably Data. She gets her ""innocence"" from Data. Picard is involved because he's the only dude both ""sides"" of her (android and Borg) trusts. Others see her as a destroyer because she could probably walk into a huge population center and make it all Borg before anyone could react, and that scares the shit out of anyone sane.",startrek,1572309175,thenwardis,4,2,True,2019-10-28

757,Picard's accent - Mystery solved.,"Ah the perennial mystery of Chateau Picard's origins. ""Why does vineyard owning Frenchman Jean Luc Picard speak with such a distinct English accent?"" ""Why does his brother Robert have a French accent?"" These questions come up over and over again on /r/startrek.

The answer seems to be buried in an early scene of S1E4, the much reviled *Code of Honor*. Data cites a term from ""the obscure language known as French"" to which Picard's only defense is that in Earth's history, French was once a great language. Given his ambitions, Jean Luc Picard was undoubtedly educated in another global language. While Robert maintains the old family ways including clinging to an all-but-forgotten local language that is barely recognized understood off Earth. 

These ideas aren't new to Trekdom. I've heard similar theories about *les frères Picard*, but I've never heard anyone specifically cite Data's evaluation of French as ""obscure"" before.

I was watching the TAS episode *Once Upon a Planet. T*he crew beam down to the Shore Leave Planet, made famous in the TOS episode *Shore Leave,* for some R&amp;R.

Spock responds with saying that he is quite familiar as his mother is very fond of Alice in Wonderland and read it to him as a child frequently.

761,About the infamous Cloaking Devices,"Recently i was thinking about why there were so rare occasions in which cloaked ships could fire. And I know there are a few semi good explanations for it being the weapon is interfering with the cloaks distortion field or simply the power requirements for both are too high. I mean somebody should have had the idea to just use a bigger Engine or an self propelled Torpedo. Also how does it come that Torpedos can't be shot through the cloak but in the movies they can exit a cloaked BoP without problems while it is landed in a Park? The more i think about it the more i am confused why only the scimitar managed to solve that problems. The scimitar had a very advanced cloak but in the end no cloak is perfect since a perfect cloak would make the ship using it blind. So to keep sensors functioning they need to somehow interfere with their surroundings which again could be detected. So here all cloaks are just some state of the art for their current time. I came to the conclusion that it makes no sense. A ship build around a Cloak should in all eras used a second shield to protect it while cloaked and weapon ideas that can shoot out of the cloak should be not that difficult to achieve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then i rewatched ST:Nemesis and now i think it would be more reasonable if there were simply Strategic reasons why the ships always decloak before or right after attacking.  Think about the strategy of Picard to fire all phasers in all directions to hit the scimitar. That should have been way more devastating. And work against pretty much every cloak regardless on how advanced it is. And instead of using slow torpedoes they should have used the phasers which hit at almost lightspeed and concentrate them on the once found cloaked ship and keep it under constant fire. That would have rendered the Cloak useless. And a ship like the Enterprise which can sustain high warp for days on end it should be no Problem to sustain constant phaserfire especially a sovereign class which is build for combat.  They used the cloak as it would be really impossible to hit that ship but that is not the point of having a cloak. If you know a cloaked ship is around an ""fire phasers in all directions and if hit concentrate all phaser fire on that and its surroundings"" would not only find the cloaked vessel but also show its dimensions and keep it from getting away.  The phasers could be used like a sensor to constantly raster the shape of the vessel and simultaneously rip it of its shields. All it would need is constant fire with phasers at the Target and not on one single point but a wider circle with that if the ship moves you could realize in which direction. If the phasers on one end of the circle still hit and the opposite ones miss you can see in which direction it moves. The bigger the ship that easier it is to track so the scimitars size quickly becomes a big disadvantage. And the small size of an maneuverable BoP makes a ton of sense. With that a cloak makes only sense in surprise attacks or by sneaking behind enemy lines doing spionage or strike at critical targets the enemy does not expect. But in close ship to ship combat the power is better used by pumping it in shields and weapons. That should be the reason why Ships always decloak if they expect combat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now i am interested in your thoughts about that topic :D

771,Top 10 Trek Funerals," Last month in the height of wedding season, I looked at the [Top Ten Trek Weddings](http://randomtrekreview.blogspot.com/2019/09/rtr-blog-andrews-top-9-trek-weddings.html) in a Four Weddings style showdown.  This month, with Halloween just days away, it seems more than fitting to talk about death and give the Top Trek Funerals the same treatment. I'll be looking at multiple factors including, cause of death (and longevity of death), the ceremony/speeches and finally the impact of the characters death overall. 

**0 - Grand Nagus Zek (DS9 - The Nagus)**  


Death/Length of Death/Character - \*  
    Zek slowly passes away in his sleep while talking with Quark to set up the premise of Quark becoming the Grand Nagus in the episode of the same name. It is your run of the mill Yoda style death (he even kind of looks like Yoda), where he drifts off to death, but with none of the weight, depth or emotion we saw in Return of the Jedi. I like a lot of people have a hard time getting through the Nagus episodes, unless he's in very small doses, so him dying doesn't elicit much emotion from me,asides perhaps relief of not having to hear that voice anymore.  Throw in the fact that he was just faking it the whole time in an elaborate Ferengi rouse, makes the whole thing pretty weak.  


Fuenral/Speeches - \*  
Zeks funeral plays second fiddle to the story of Quark becoming the Nagus in this one; there aren't many in attendance and the only real distinguishing feature is a picture of Zek in a gaudy brass frame, in classic human ceremony fashion. One saving grace is that we are introduced to the Ferengi tradition of selling off the remains of the deceased in vacuum packed petri dishes as a collectible. We would see this again in future episodes done much better, but this was where the idea was born, and so deserves a tip of the cap!

Overall - \*  
    Considering that this wasn't actually a death, but more of a test that Zek was running to see what his son would do with the Grand Nagus power, it ranks at the bottom of the list. We do learn that nice piece of Ferengi tradition of selling off the deceased, but we also get no speeches, no real emotion and no real funeral proceedings, so for that, Zek finds himself in the tenth spot on our list.

So the first movie was so amazing that these characters I enjoyed were given a second chance. Then the second and third film really blew my mind. And when ST: IV came out, I felt it was the perfect ending to a great trilogy (ST: 2, 3 and 4). I didn't go see ST:5 in the theaters, I was a young man focusing on school, work, women, etc. But I rented it when it came out on video, and I couldn't get through the Yosemite scenes, the writing was bad, the jokes were bad, the acting was phoned-in at best. I tried again a few years later when it was on TV, but after just a little while into it, I remembered why I didn't like it the first time. An alien bar scene is the most cliche thing a science fiction movie can do. ST:6 was watchable, but maybe it's just me, but by that time I had already been watching TNG and DS9, and the TOS crew were looking old and tired in comparison. I just had a re-watch of ST:2, 3 and 4 this week, and I once again tried number five, but I just couldn't do it. The ""beans around the campfire"" scene was atrocious, *Blazing Saddles*  did it better.

783,A collection of thoughts and questions...,"I haven't posted on here in a while, but in that time I've absorbed a lot more Star Trek that I hadn't seen previously. My parents also watched some of it for the first time too so I might throw in some of their opinions too. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. We finally finished all of the movies (not counting the Kelvin timeline ones). I think they get a bad wrap sometimes. I definitely see how someone can not like them and they absolutely have their flaws but they also have their merits too. The lone exception being Final Frontier. Having the movie book-ended by Kirk, Spock, and McCoy singing Row Row Row Your Boat is egregious to me.
2. I said in a previous post on this subreddit but I still think that TMP is somewhat underrated. I fully get why some people refer to it as the ""Slow-Motion Picture"", but without a proper battle scene, it feels like more of an expedition instead of a fight, and I really like that. It's something I kinda wish they did more. Parents thought it was the worst one.
3. Best TOS movie is Wrath of Khan. I don't think that's super controversial to say. What might be is that Search for Spock, Voyage Home, and Undiscovered Country are also really good in their own ways. 'Rents liked Undiscovered Country the best, but weren't a huge fan of these because they just don't like Shatner as an actor.
4. Things really started to heat up with the TNG movies, and I gotta say I don't think there was a bad one in the bunch. Generations had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I actually can't believe that they killed off Kirk. I guess they kinda set it up with him saying he knew was gonna die alone, but technically he didn't.
5. First Contact was the best movie, TNG or otherwise. It almost felt like a horror movie at some points. I really love the message about how we look at historical figures. We have a tendency to glorify them but in reality, they were just regular people with vices just like the rest of us, perhaps having no intention of being remembered through history.
6. Here's something that might be controversial: Insurrection and Nemesis aren't that bad. I can see why they weren't super well received but they definitely had their positives. Insurrection demonstrated how the Federation was sort of losing itself in the Dominion War, how they weren't immune from forgetting their ideals. Nemesis was my least favorite of the 4 TNG ones but it still had a lot of good action. It had a different feel to it then the rest of the movies but I think it only added to it. I wasn't a huge fan of the lack of explanation as to how the cloned Picard but other than that, I enjoyed myself. It felt like a straight up action movie though. I can't figure out the message in it if there was one. Parents favorite movie overall was Insurrection btw.
7. Lastly for the opinion part of this: I fully get that some people think Generations and Insurrection are just episodes of the show that they wanted to do but never got to, but I don't think necessarily a problem. I'd argue TMP is too.

&amp;#x200B;

If you made this far, thanks for being so patient :)

Now for some questions:

1. What's everyone's favorite/least favorite movie?
2. Thoughts on Riker and Troi getting back together? Think that was always the plan from the start of the show?
3. Was anyone else holding on for dear life when they saw Enterprise-D crash for the first time?
4. What's your favorite Enterprise? Mine is E. The Sovereign class is sleak AF.
5. Any chance we see the Enterprise in ST: Picard? I feel like they'll show it at some point, might be up to Enterprise-F by that point.
6. Lastly, who's your favorite captain? Mine is Sisko, my dad's is Janeway, and my mom's is Picard (so it's another thing we disagree on).

784,What can be done to make our earth more like the one from the federation?,"I think its an understatement to sat that things are really bad right now. I feel like every other news story I read on a daily basis is warning me about the impending apocalypse. So naturally I found my way back to Star Trek after a substantial hiatus. I was only familiar with the original series and the films,  I saw them as a kid, but I loved Picard from the movies so I decided to watch TNG for the first time. For the most part it was great. I got to see lots of classic episodes like ""tapestry"" and ""I, Borg."" In many ways it was the comfort food that I needed. Then I started watching DS9 for the first time. I absolutely loved it and its now my favorite Star Trek series. But there was one particular episode that had a greater impact on me than I expected. That episode was ""Past Tense."" Based on what I have seen on the internet, this episode has been on lots of peoples minds recently. (Among other things, there was an article about it that ran recently on [startrek.com](https://startrek.com) )  


Watching ""Past Tense"" was something of a gut punch. Its truly a great episode, and one of DS9's best IMO, but it was disheartening to be reminded that in the years since that episode first aired, the world is starting to look more like the one from the DS9 version of 2024 and less like the one that is part of the federation. In the months since I've watched the episode I keep thinking about the question that Dr. Bashir asks Sisko at the end of the episode.   


""How could they have let things get so bad?""  


Ira Steven Behr said in a twitter post something to the effect of ""If you don't like the future in 'Past Tense' work to prevent it."" Obviously we can't make contact with an alien race that will grant us space travel, but all the problems in the world right now were made by humans so we have to have the capacity to solve them as well right?   
 

  
So with that in mind...what are some things that each of us can do to make our earth MORE like the one in Star Trek? What are the best attributes of the federation and how could they be implemented in the real world? Big or small, it doesn't matter.

788,Would be nice to have a successor to the Star Trek Bridge Commander video game for ALL sci-fi fans,"I was reminiscing how great and unique video game Star Trek Bridge Commander was, in my opinion even better than Star Trek Online.  Specifically, it was great what you could do with it using mods that add new ships, capabilities, maps etc. in the Quick Battle mode. Besides the story missions, the Quick Battle mode gave you the freedom to do your own battles the way you want them.

Wouldn't it be great if a new video game like Bridge Commander was made but only this time it took into consideration other scifi fandoms as wells? Imagine a game were all sci-fi universes exist. You could make battles between Star Trek and Stargate ships, use the Hyperdrive instead of the Warp Drive, or use the Jump Gate from Babylon 5, or make an FTL jump just like in Battlestar Galactica. A game which includes by default(without mods, but would be moddable) ships, maps (places in the scifi universe like DS9 or the Pegasus Galaxy from Stargate), physics, weapons and technology from all major sci-fi universes like Star Trek, Stargate, Star Wars, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, The Expanse, The Orville and more!!! :)

We always hear news of a new Star Wars game or a new space sci-fi game(Everspace, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous) but always other sci-fi universes like Star Trek or Stargate, etc. get left out. Don't get me wrong, Star Trek Online for example is a great game but it isn't as open-world/exporable and doesn't give you the freedom to do whatever you want(e.g. battle against 100 borg ships). Would be nice if a big video games studio made such a game, attracting the attention of not only Star Trek fans, not only Star Wars fans, not only Stargate fans.......... but fans from all sci-fi tv series/movies!! Sure, some games are customizable with mods, but not always you find what you're looking for and at the end, it's just a mod and not a full new experience. Another example, Stellaris is moddable and has a great Star Trek mod but it's hard to find other good mods for Stargate, Babylon 5 and so on and even the Star Trek mod isn't enough because Stellaris wasn't tailored to the Star Trek universe(warp drive and other physics) and it's still not gonna feel Star Trek authentic.

791,Picard was given a chance at another life - not once but twice!,"Think about whats the biggest desire/regret/wish most people have - its to have another chance at life. What's the one constant, no matter whether its the dark ages or the super advanced scifi utopian world of Trek, where there's still no immortality. The one thing every philosopher has said since time immemorial - 

""You have only one life!""

And yet, Picard was given a chance to redo his life, to live it all over again. In 'The Inner Light' thanks to the alien probe and then again when he's in the Nexus. The 2nd time he can literally make his life the way he wants to. And he gets to live an entire alternate life in 'Inner Light'.

I think this is unique not only in Trek but in most mainstream scifi and certainly on tv.

Obviously this changed him deeply, and clearly a lesser man may have chosen to stay on in the Nexus (or maybe not - it was after all a plot device to get him back). But the true implications of this were never really explored. It would cause lasting psychological damage most likely, the human psyche is just not equipped to deal with this.

Personally I'd never leave the Nexus. Who is to say that our current reality isn't a Nexus of some sort or some giant simulacra. The fact is we have no way to ever tell. There is a lot of scope here - e.g. is the Nexus what is meant by heaven? I don't think the writers ever wanted to tackle this subject because it was probably too much even for Trek.

We have witnessed in a later episode, I believe it was a DS9 episode... Q pulled Riker out of his own “time frame” and used him as an example in some point he was trying to make, then returned him without him remembering any of it ever happened. From *Riker’s* time stream perspective, the timeline moves seamlessly. But that pocket where he existed elsewhere for a duration also exists/existed. 

He’s a wise man, if not still a little foolhardy. He’s obviously not going to go back and undo what happened on the Pegasus, or anything. That’s become part of his character, part of who he is now. Not to mention, that all culminated with him as 1st Officer on the Enterprise with Mon Capitaine. He didn’t want to change any of that. 

But suppose someone had enough of an ego, enough regret in his “shades of grey” to make him want to start fresh, but to also maintain his current life also. Why not, then, simply make a copy of yourself? Hide him somewhere in your remote past, come “rescue” him, and voila, best of both worlds. 

If he was a clever boy, he kept his consciousness in *both* forms, simultaneously. He would be free to live TWO lives at once... free to run off and become a Maquis Rebel or some bull-hockey.

Enterprise and crew plot a course to P'Jem, a Vulcan outpost that houses an historic monastary. A place for Vulcans to pass Kholinar, the purging of emotions.the reason for the visit is outlet educational, but when they arrive they find the place taken over by extremely hostile Andorians, one of which is the infamous Shran. They take the ENT crew and all of the Vulcan monks hostage on the case that they believe the Vulcans were using secret technology to spy on Andoria. Which breaks the treaty they have in place. Well, in the end, with a wonderful twist ending, P'Jem does indead have invasive surveillance technology.

It forces you switch teams instantly, like Capt. Archer does.

The fact that Vulcans were using invasive mass surveillance on Andoria and hiding the fact rings true with contemporary problems.

The episode is fairly prescient in regard to how the NSA and companies like Facebook and Google are spying and keeping information. I would argue is cairly important Start Trek episode.

Archer does kind of go full Bush for the majority of the episode but I think he ultimately makes the right decision in the end by giving the information to the Andorians, the victims.",startrek,1572471064,CT-1138,18,24,True,2019-10-30

This is our first look into the show!

I was recently watching Year of Hell again, I mean it is a great episode and shows so much potential about how VOY should have been.

Anyhow, we have seen both in TNG as in VOY that the Q view themselves as keepers of balance in the universe. Furthermore we saw in both ENT as VOY that in the future several fractions are monitoring the time line and some actively trying to protect it (mostly Federation time agents).

So here is my questions, why didn't the Q, nor any faction of time agents, intervene when the Krenim were changing the timelines?

It's an interesting window into a sort of Mirror Universe, if Star Trek had continued to be written by period science fiction writers instead of being put on ice for decades and revived as something distinctly different from the TOS and the science fiction writers whose work inspired many of the original episodes.

In that respect it reminds me of ADB's Star Fleet Universe, which is clearly influenced by Star Trek TOS/TAS in most general respects, but which cleaves more closely to a more traditional (and probably more plausible/human) science fiction setting where everyone hasn't become Yuppies who live on giant IPod spaceships.",startrek,1572510418,IdleAutarch,15,11,True,2019-10-31

But consider that after Voyager Endgame, Unimatrix 1 was destroyed, along with the queen, the Collective mind and the transwarp network. There's still thousands of Borg ships and millions/billions of borg drones still out there, either wandering aimlessly, or adapting to form a new Collective. Either a dangerous scenario

Sending an armada to rescue all these Borg, lead by a man who was once a Borg and then regain his humanity, along with Seven, another former drone who regained her humanity, would go along with the UFPs goal of security and compassion. It was probably also his idea.

So then either the plan goes very well (drones regain their individuality) or horribly (a small fraction of the Borg survive, and those that make it are imprisoned). Either way the galaxy is saved (says Seven), but the effort/result took a piece of Picard that can never be recovered.

Also, I'm ranting.)","I've been slowly making my way through the ST franchise for the last decade (finished TNG DS9, haven't finished TOS, VOG and ENT), but I've never really been active in the fandom and I'm not sure what the consensus is on this eggplant of a character. But, I mean, I just dont think that there are any contenders. 

I'm still making my way through VOG, but I feel one of the many problems the show has is characters. Besides Tuvok, The Doctor and Janeway the cast is all very bland... but its Chakotay who I just actively hate. 

Because it's just.. like, you expect a First Officer to fill a void right? 

With Kirk being such an emotional and instinctual leader, Spock in theory can keep him grounded by offering an alternative, coldly factual perspective on how to handle a situation. Picard is this larger-than-life, highly decorated Starfleet legend who might often seem a little daunting to approach for the typical ensign, so by having the very personable and friendly Riker (spends more time playing poker with his crew than ordering them around) as his First, we get a kind of buffer between the average joe and the intimidating captain. For Sisko, Kira being a kind of First Officer was not only handy because she was a functional liasion to the Bajoran people for Starfleet, but she served as a constant reminder to him about what the high and lofty standards/ideals of the Federation actually mean to the on-the-ground people who are effected by them. She was like cold water in his face. So, yeah, voids are filled by First Officers. 

Now, what void exactly is Chakotay filling for Janeway? What is she capable of doing as Captain that she would not be capable of doing without Chakotay? 

 I mean, there was the whole Marquis thing and you can argue that he serves as a kind of mouthpiece for the Marquis half of Voyager... but that shit pretty much stopped being relevant after the first half of season 1 iirc. The Marquis doesn't matter most of the time. As of season 4 (what I'm up to right now), Chakotay pretty much agrees with everything Janeway says, and the few times he disagreed, his way of doing things was shown to be ineffective (Borg season 3 finale) or just not mattering (Year in Hell pt 1 and 2). He adds nothing. 

And even looking at it outside of expected role fulfillment in First Officers, he just falls flat for me as a character. The actor just completely sucks the life out of every scene he's in. I never imagined a guy with a face tattoo can ever be accused of being boring. I don't get what energy he's supposed to be giving off. Is he dangerous? Is he solemn? Is he fucking alive? 

And okay, apart from being former Marquis and an ineffective First, what else does Chakotay have going for him. Ah yes, the totally awkward and really out-of-place mysticism angle. I know my atheism is showing with this, and I do think that there is a way to do religion/faith/spirituality in ST right (DS9 is my favorite ST series so far), but a lot of the times Chakotay's spiritual-centric episodes felt so reductive on a show all about dispelling superstition and embracing the truth about our universe. Thankfully, it seems like VOY gave up on this angle after season 2. Hopefully they did anyway. 

And you have to believe me, I WANT to like characters. I am looking for a reason to like Chakotay but I just don't see it. 

I'm sure there was an in-universe reason why the infinitely more interesting and more useful Tuvoc got passed over for First officer, but I have to imagine that at a writer's table in the mid 90's, some guy was like ""Tuvok is the First right?"" and another guy said ""yeah, he'd be good, but we already had a Vulcan as First Officer in the first series so we can't do that again. Gotta go with the Marquis guy."" Fuck.

I was really hoping to be blown away and wasn't. The story is good but it seems to be it lacks the depth and emotional impact of TIL. And I think a large part of that has to do with both Benjamin and Jake Sisco's actors acting. I just didn't buy their emotional involvement or the way they cried etc - it seemed forced and like it was being acted.

The high point of the episode and the thing that holds it together is Tony Todd and he really is head and shoulders above both the Sisco's.

And if I can compare to TIL once more, every since side character in that one - from the wife (a true standout) to Batai to his son (played by his real son) is so memorable and adds to the story but in the Visitor its only Tony Todd.

895,TAS: The Time Trap &amp; VOY: The Void.,"I find it hard not to speculate that *The Void* was inspired by *The Time Trap.* 

In *The Time Trap,* the Enterprise crew get sucked into the Delta Triangle, an area of space that acts as a pocket in time. Time travels extremely slow there and there are no stars. Therein lies a bunch of other trapped ships. A peaceful society has been born in the time trap, centuries prior by those who have all become trapped. The dilithium reserves start decaying, and by Scotty's estamtes, they have two days to  attempt to leave. In order to break the barrier, the Enterprise has to team up with Kor and the Klingons by physically combining their ships and activating their Warp Drives at the same time.

In *The Void,* Voyager gets sucked into an area of space absent of all matter, and like the Delta Triangle, totally black as far as the eye can see. Also like in the Delta Triangle, other lost ships are in the void. Instead of a peaceful co-operative society, the Void houses an Alliance driven war zone, where lost ships prey on less fortunate and less able-bodied ships. The big difference is that the Void is home to a native species that prey off of the lost ships by stowing away on them and eating their reserves/sabotaging their technology. Again, in order to break the barrier, Voyager crew has to team up with three other ships by combining and sharing technologies, and attempting to create a polaron modulator which will allow all of the to escape.

896,Just finished all of TNG...,"Well... I've finally done it. 

I have watched every episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and every Star Trek movie that exists. What a journey this has been. 

Specifically, I have just a moment ago finished the TNG finale, ""All Good Things"". I feel a bit strange right now... I've been in love with, addicted to and obsessed with Star Trek for years now. And now that I have completed arguably the two most iconic pillars of the franchise (TOS and TNG), I just feel... a bit sad. Like... no more watching **new** Star Trek after a hard day at college anymore. Any time I watch an adventure with Kirk or Picard from now on, its gonna be a repeat / an episode I've seen before. No more new TNG adventures await me, no! 

I don't know if this even makes sense, I'm fully aware that I am rambling right now. This is just a stream of consciousness, I guess. I just wanted to jot down my feelings. What a fantastical journey this has been. I feel a sense of sadness that it is over... Of course in reality, the journey is not over, for I foresee plenty more new Trek in my future - I plan on beginning Deep Space 9 and the new Picard series once that's finally out, and I greatly look forward to both of those shows. But still... just knowing that I have no more new adventures to look forward to in the TOS and TNG style and with those lovely crews, I'm not sure... I just feel a bit sad. It's like watching your best friend grow up and drift away from you! 

Again, fully aware this is a ramble. Its late and I'm not thinking properly. I just wanted to wrote this down before going to bed. I love this franchise so much. My adventures with Captain Kirk and Captain Picard have brought me so much joy throughout the years. I look forward to everything that is to come. Adore, adore, adore this series, and I am so proud to call myself a Trekkie. I feel at home in this lovely little bubble we call the Trek fandom. 

I apologise for my soppy sentimentality, it's just that ""All Good Things"" was really quite good and it's got me reflecting on my Trek journey thus far and how much ST really means to me on a personal level. God knows what strong role models Kirk, Spock, Picard and Data have been to me throughout the years. Sounds sad to say, but the crew of the Enterprise have been the closest friends I've had in probably my whole life. Fully aware I'm talking about fictional TV characters here, but it's funny how close you can kind of develop a bond with people when you come home to watch them and their adventures after having a really crappy day at college, and they're always there for you. I'm probably coming across as very weird right now but all I'm saying is, this show has helped me through a lot of really tough times, and provided me with some really positive role models to look up to and aspire to be like some day. Ah this is too sappy,  I'm gonna shut up and call it a night now.  I apologise for the train of thought but I just wanted to get this all out.

Torres might be a good engineer, but in the immortal words of Proximo - 'you're good, but you're not that good' and would've been fired and sent off on any other ship/occasion. Even late into the series, she's whining about 7of9 being 'rude' which takes some nerve.

915,Question about the TNG &amp; DS9/VOY uniforms?,"Is there any logic behind why sometimes you see one and then the other? I've been watching DS9 currently and I don't see any logic behind it. Sisko arrives on DS9 with the traditional TNG style uniform and meets Miles who already wears the mostly black DS9 style uniform. Then later Sisko changes into one of those too. Meanwhile Picard in the DS9 pilot continues to wear his TNG uniform (and they continue to do so in TNG). So at this point I figured TNG style is for starships and DS9 style is for space stations. Thomas Riker's appearance, Worf's first appearance and the crew from the Lexington with Bashir's old rival support that.

Here's where I get confused. In Star Trek Generations the Enterprise crew is wearing both, Voyager uses the DS9 style uniforms and in DS9 I'm currently watching the two parter where Sisko is sent to earth cause of the changelings (Homefront &amp; Paradise Lost). He and all the Starfleet personnel wear the TNG style uniforms. 

I know it's a weird thing to notice but it's something that never really made sense to me. Is there any in-universe logic to it?",startrek,1572808339,Tom_Dynamite,6,6,True,2019-11-03

If you do an adult story, he doesn't really fit it. And if you do a kid story, you can't really use any of the other characters. 

Season 1 was filled with lots of annoying ""Wesley saves the ship"" stories. I think they did well in season 2, which had a lot of coming of age type episodes for him. But after that in seasons 3 and 4, he got the Tasha Yar treatment of mostly being in the background and saying ""Aye, sir!"" So it's no wonder he wanted to leave.

I guess if he wasn't Gene Roddenbury's Gary Stu character, he would've been better as a reoccurring guest character. They could focus episodes on what it's like growing up on a starship without a father, and his surrogate father relationship with Picard.

931,Rewatching early TNG,"Recently, I began my first rewatch of TNG, and was considering just skipping to Season 3 since the first two seasons are considered bad by most, but for some reason I decided to restart from the beginning.

And honestly, a lot of early TNG isn't nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. While Seasons 3-7 are definitely better, there are still plenty of gems in Seasons 1-2. There are the obvious stand-outs like *Measure of a Man* and *Q Who?* but there are also other good episodes that slip beneath the cracks

I've always really liked *The Royale*. It wasn't the most philosophical Star Trek has ever been, but it was some good fun seeing our characters solve a strange mystery. Not to mention episodes like *Arsenal of Freedom*, *The Icarus Factor*, *Where Silence Has Lease*, and *Conspiracy*. All of which have good interactions between the crew and have them challenged in some physical or emotional way.

 And then there is *Heart of Glory*, which is one of my favorite Worf-centric episodes of the entire show. Anyway, I think TNG defined the characters very well in the first two seasons. We saw their values through traditional exploration episodes, and we saw lots of their hobbies in more laid-back episodes, which helped humanize them.

What are your thoughts on early TNG? Do you consider it worth rewatching? And is Tasha Yar an interesting character who **SPOILER** &gt;!was killed too soon !&lt;**SPOILER**, or is it just me?",startrek,1572840225,ggg375,24,39,True,2019-11-03

933,It's fundamentally impossible to actually change history in Star Trek,"Star Trek, like most science fiction, has often used time travel for its plots. While many of these events are based around the characters doing something stupid, and seemingly altering history, there is one common thread among all these stories that gives a pretty interesting look at the nature of time in the Star Trek universe. Specifically, that time can't actually be altered in any real way.

* Going all the way back to TOS  S1 we have the episode ""City of the Edge of Forever"", an episode were the gang goes back in time to 1930, and accidentally saves a women, which creates a new timeline where the Federation never came into power due to vastly different events on Earth. However, because they used the Guardian of Forever to go into the past, and come back, and because the Guardian is a being that exists outside of time, the Guardian is able to inform them of said change, and help them be able to fix it, creating a situation where the change never happened.
* In TOS S2 we have ""Assignment Earth"", where the crew goes back in time to 1968, and ends up accidentally getting in the way of Gary Seven's transporter beam. They eventually end up helping him stop humanity from destroying itself via accidental nuclear war. At the end of the episode Spock corrects Seven's assessment that the interference of the Enterprise crew was accidental, by pointing out that had they not been there, then the timeline they came from couldn't have existed, meaning they were always meant to be there.
* This is also true of STIV. Kirk and crew go back in time to steal some whales in order to stop the Whale Probe, as all the whales had gone extinct by their time. While Kirk manages to steal two whales, when they return there is no visible change in the future from their actions. One could argue that Kirk's actions helped facilitate the extinction of the whales in the first place, or that, since the whales were all going to die anyways, removing two of them would have changed nothing. Either way, nothing changes.
* This same holds true for TNG. In Yesterday's Enterprise the ENT-C gets thrown into an alternate future where the Federation and Klingon Empire are at war, but luckily Guinan is there to inform Picard that this isn't the right timeline, and they help the ENT-C go back to where it belongs, reverting the change.
* The same is true for First Contact. The Borg go back in time and attempt to assimilate Earth before it develops warp drive, but luckily the Enterprise gets caught in the temporal wake, and manages to stop the Borg. As we learn later in Enterprise itself, this is part of a larger predestination paradox where the Borg from First Contact manage to awaken during the NX era, and send the signal to the Delta Quadrant which is what drew the Borg to Federation space in the first place, and set into action the series of events in the first place.
* Moving on to DS9. Quark, Rom, and Nog, end up getting sent back in time and cause the Roswell Incident. Another situation where going back in time and mucking in things they shouldn't be there for actually creates the right timeline.
* Same with when Sisko and the gang get sent back in time to the Bell Riots, accidentally get Bell killed, and Sisko takes his place. Since Sisko and Bell look so much alike, its impossible to really know if it ever was Bell in the first place, and if Sisko actually changed anything, or just did what we was always destined to do.
* Moving into Voyager we have the case of Henry Starling and the timeship Aeon, where said timeship goes back in time to 1967, where Starling finds it, and ends up creating the microprocessor revolution from it. Something that, had it never happened, would make the Aeon's existence impossible. Another bootstrap paradox.
* We see the same with Annorax, where he spends ages altering time, only for it to end with his timeship, and all the changes he made, erased from time, reverting the timeline back to normal. Annorax also makes the curious comment that he feels like time is fighting against his attempts to change it, something to note for later.
* Going into Star Trek Enterprise, we OFC have the already mentioned Borg paradox, but we also have the entire Temporal Cold War situation, where  Daniels, and agent from the year 3050, helps Archer save humanity from the Xindi attack, something that is itself a paradox as his timeline couldn't exist unless said event happened. 
* Even in Star Trek Discovery S2, since it happens after Enterprise, and Enterprise can only happen if Daniels exists, and Daniels can't exist if Control wins and destroys all life in the galaxy, we can be fairly certain that all of the timelines crated by Gabrielle Burnham's use of the time suit to stop Control were nothing but temporary false futures that existed solely to work time into fixing itself. If Control ever actually won then Daniels couldn't exist, which means humanity would be destroyed by the Xindi, which means the Federation could never exist to make Control in the first place, repeat a la paradox.

There are only two exceptions to this, but even those are unlikely to be real exceptions

* The first is the actions of Admiral Janeway in Voyager's ""Endgame"". Admiral Janeway gets a device that allows her to go back in time, convince her younger self to use the Borg transwarp network to get home early, and deal a massve blow to the Borg. While this may seem like a change in the timeline sticking, the novels(admittedly non-canon) actually explain this by having Temporal Agents attempt to stop Janeway, only to be stopped themselves by Temporal Agents from fruther in the future coming back and telling them that Janeway's time travel was always part of the correct timeline. An assertion that is largely supported by all the other canonal uses of time travel.
* The second is with the Kelvin timeline, where Nero's incursion into ""the past"" creates an alternate version of the events of the TOS era. However, the Kelvin timeline is a separate quantum universe, whose history was the same as the Prime's up until that point, not an actual  extension of the prime universe's timeline. It was never actually the Prime universe, so Nero's incursion didn't actually ""change"" anything. Its also important to note that, in a line cut from the film, but kept in the novelization, and the comic book adaption IIRC, Prime Spock notes the statistical improbability of the crew of the Enterprise coming together in this new timeline, and suggests that time itself may be attempting to undo the damage caused by Nero's incursion. A hypothesis supported by Annorax's comments, as well as the large list of not-changes above. Also since Nero's incursion happened after the events of Enterprise, and Enterprise only works if Daniel exists, even after Nero ""changed"" things, they must end up in the same future regardless.

The problem with attempting to actually change history in the Star Trek universe is that the Star Trek timeline is a series of nested paradoxes, spanning from at least 1967, all the way to the year 3050, that could only happen if all the other paradoxes happen as well. So even if you somehow manage to break one of the paradoxes, the existence of the other paradoxes will force the timeline to correct itself to ensure the other paradoxes happen. Thus, it is fundamentally impossible to actually affect any sort of real or noticeable change within this period of time within the Star Trek universe.

Of course, TOS focuses on a trio: Kirk, Spock, and Bones. But there are also lots of background characters that were mostly neglected. While the movies would later give more characterization to the senior bridge staff, they didn't get too much to do during the series, with the exception of Scotty, who was basically the fourth main character.

953,The Needs of the Many and the Needs of the Few.,"I've always been struck by the apparent flaw in the logic of ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"". It seems peculiar given the fact that, as we know from bitter reality, this argument is used as an excuse to trample over minority groups the world over. 

Maybe post-Surak Vulcans forgot that many species were not quite as civilised and this logic only applies in a civilisation without prejudices? I'm just curious as to why this seems to be such a sacrosanct idea in Vulcan society yet it appears so obviously illogical in many respects (from a human perspective at least).

954,Trying to figure out if Star Trek Las Vegas would be worth going to...,"I really got into Star Trek this year in a big way. Years and years ago, I got into the Kelvin timeline flicks and watched TNG casually, but this year, I practically binged all of TOS, all 13 movies, and am watching Discovery on Blu Ray (eagerly awaiting Season 2 next week!). I'm also a big reader, and bought up a collection of about 25 original series tie-in novels that I'm working my way through. I've become really passionate about this show, and don't plan to stop there.

So I'm curious about going to ST:LV, because the only conventions I've been to were relatively small (500+ attendees) and centered around anime or multi-fandom fantasy/sci-fi stuff. The anime one attracted more kids and teens, whereas the multi-fandom one just didn't have a whole lot of what I was interested in, so I would like to see what going to a large-scale, Trek-centered con would be like.

Now, I'm not really into toys, props, costumes, meet and greets, or autographed ""whatevers,"" but I really enjoy talking/learning/reading about Star Trek, and I want to immerse myself in as much of the best parts of the fandom as possible. I guess you could say my main motivations would be to experience the panels and community.

I would also be bringing my husband along, who's not especially into Trek, but who I know would tag along without complaint. But of course the kicker is... the money.

We live in Tennessee, and would definitely need to save up for airfare, accommodations, food, and tickets. I'm not sure how much we'd need – I'm thinking maybe close to $1k per person – and I'm assuming we wouldn't be able to go for a year or two, since we'd have to save up for it.

So to people who have been, or have any experience with Trek conventions, do you think it's worth it for me to save up for?",startrek,1572903253,christeagueart,13,6,True,2019-11-04
955,I think Discovery is a really good show... as long as I forget it's Star Trek.,"Like many, I was disappointed with season 1. Too flashy. Ornamenty Klingons. So many lights. A super advanced star ship no one in the future Star Trek universe had ever heard of. There were many things that made me scratch my head. It was entertaining... but that's not what Star Trek is about. I resisted watching sesaon 2 for a long time but I finally swallowed my pride and gave it a chance. I did however do one thing different. Within the first 2 episodes I found myself being moved and immersed in what was happening. I didn't like that that was happened because the base ""Star Trek"" elements weren't there. It was still the flashy, keep-the-audience-visually-and-emotionally-engaged-at-all-times style from season 1. Albeit with better writing and better pacing. The solution to this conundrum I came up with was to just watch the show as if it was it's own stand alone creation. Not Star Trek or canon with any other part of it.... and it worked!! Season 2 was actually quite well done. The production quality is obviously top end. As was season 1. The performances were VERY good. Particularly from Sonequa Martin-Green, but everyone. The writing was much better and a lot of the scrath-your-head holes from season 1 were decently filled by the end of season 2. 

So although it takes a pretty strong suspension of disbelief to just ignore the Starfleet insignias and the familiar characters, once I was able to successfully block that out, I actually really enjoyed season 2 a lot and am really looking forward to season 3.",startrek,1572915069,sage_006,25,0,True,2019-11-04

There a few things I don't quite get and/or standout to me:

First, Sisko is promoted to captain seemingly without any need for testing. I was under the impression earning captain required passing rigorous testing program/command school?

Second, they seem to introduce the concept of non-comms. I was under the impression all Starfleet officers are academics/subject specialists and that attending Starfleet academy isn't required. There are also a number of crew members on the defiant who have a no-pip rank less than ensign. How would one get into Starfleet without attending Starfleet academy? I understand Starfleet academy is relatively prestigious and difficult but In a world where education is presumably free why would anyone not go to Starfleet academy?

The reason why odo looks different is because he isn’t super skilled at shapeshifting so his appearance will always be a little off, but why the other changelings? In that series of episodes where the changelings infiltrated earth one (or many) were able to assume the exact same form as another human. I guess it comes down to practice as odo even said himself in regards to the accuracy of the form. For example in the episode children of time where the crew sees their Descendants, odo looks less “off” because he had hundreds of years to perfect it. But then again It (presumably) didn’t take the changeling on earth hundreds of years to perfect a human form. My overall question is why don’t the changelings choose to look like how future odo did in the children of time rather than just like odo?",startrek,1572980455,thotgor_is_a_breen,20,2,True,2019-11-05

There is also ""Killing Games"" (VOY, Episode 4x18): unlike the abominable Enterprise episode with the Nazis, this one is interesting: the set is extraordinary, the explosion of the gestapo building has not aged, and the Hirogen take a real psycholigic thickness with the very good character: Karr.

The Dads always get the credit for being cool and geeky but in my family, the geekiest of them all was my grandmother, a great grandmother to my son. I was born on the day of her 42nd birthday, the first grandson.

My grandmother Joan was a real plain speaking woman who wasn't afraid to swear in public, much to the embarassment of her family at times. She liked a beer and in her 80's she took up smoking saying ""What's it going to do ? Kill me ? Hah, I'd like to see it try""

As I child I remember playing in her gigantic two storey house that was full of glass display cases containing replica ships including tiny crew, something her first husband was into. She had marigolds in the front yard and those swans that you made by cutting and painting old tyres and put plants into. Her house was directly across the park from the local primary school that I attended briefly. I used to make it my daily mission to be good at the end of the day in order to be let out of class early, running full pelt across the park, too fast for the magpies to swoop me to see if I could get there before the Sesame Street theme song started.

I didn't know my grandmother was such a geek until much later in life. We'd briefly discussed Star Trek when I was in my 30's and she'd made a big point of saying ""I'm not into all that Star Wars mumbo jumbo. Star Trek had real stories and real men in them"". Not exactly sure why she didn't think Harrison Ford was as much of a man as William Shatner but I was behind her all the way because I didn't give a fig about Star Wars either and I admired her conviction.

It was later in her 80's when she moved to our town that I really got to know her better and realised just how deeply into Star Trek she really was. I mean she had EVERYTHING. Every book, every movie and every episode from every series. She said ""You've seen TOS right ?"" and I said ""Oh yeah, saw it on TV plenty of times"" and she said ""No, you need to watch it again. Here, I have the DVD's. I'll lend you a few every week and you can tell me which episodes you liked the most"". It was almost like a quiz. She knew her lore so well that I could recount an episode to her and she'd say ""Oh yes, that was the one where Kirk met that lady who turned out to be ..."" and she'd go off on an intimate recounting of it as if she'd been the one who just watched it yesterday.

Voyager was where she really got me. I'd never seen Voyager. She said ""I'm not such a fan of the woman captain, but story is very good. It's ongoing. Tell me what you think of this one"" and she lent me all of Voyager, bit by bit. I spent a whole summer just watching all the old Star Trek from TOS, to TNG, Voyager, even DS9 which she sort of lost me on but even she agreed it was a bit rambling but still had its merits.

I tried to get her into Enterprise but she couldn't handle the ""young"" captain, Scott Bakula. I rememer being at the pub one day downing a pint with her on her 86th or 87th birthday saying ""Do you remember him as Sam Beckett from Quantumn Leap ?"" and she stretched back in her chair for a moment and said ""He had the hologram friend, right ?"" You got it grandma. She might not remember where she left her garage door remote sometimes, but she could tell you the plot of any sci-fi ever made.

The one that blew me out the most was on her second to last birthday, we were out for fish and chips and a pint at the pub as we did every birthday and out of nowhere she said ""What do you think about Stargate ?"" I replied ""Oh, the first series was great, but I think it just went a bit silly in later series and I didn't get it anymore. It's so long ago though that I saw it, I barely remember the plot of the first one"", and to the amazement of everyone at the table she continued ""It was that Anderson fellow that played Jack"" and went on over a full ten minutes to describe the plot of the first episode of SG-1 as if she'd just seen it yesterday. I asked ""How long since you saw that grandma ?"" and she said ""Oh, years. I have it on VHS somewhere. Do you want to borrow it ? It's very good"".

If I have half as many wits and memories about me when I'm 60 as she had at 90 I'll be pretty damn happy with myself. I'll always picture her sitting on the verandah at my parent's house, a beer in front of her, just staring off into the distant sky wistfully saying softly ""Yes... I'd like to go into space"".

Nan, I wish I could send your ashes into space but you always said you didn't want anyone to make a big fuss about you when you're gone and since you know as well as any scientist that all the atoms in the universe will travel through space endlessly, now that you're at rest you finally will be ... In space.

""Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives, but I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey, and reminds us to cherish every moment... because they'll never come again."" - Jean-Luc Picard, Star Trek: The Next Generation.

I have not watched Discovery yet so I don't know the details of why they look the way they do (if there is an explanation).

I can see it going one of three ways:

1. Worf looks like classic Worf.
2. Worf looks like the new style Klingons and maybe alienates a portion of the fanbase.
3. This is a non-issue due to the recent re-merging of CBS/Paramount thus ignoring the old agreements about things being 25% different or whatever.

I can also see this being a non-issue as we don't know if Dorn is even going to appear in Picard, especially with the expense of doing all that makeup for what would essentially be a cameo.

And while I stopped at Journey to Babel I don't dislike Friday's Child but I've always viewed that episode as a better bookend for the run because it's of the same quality of the Menagerie.

1013,"Are Klingons and Cardassians genetically disposed towards aggression, or is it a cultural thing?","Both species have done some pretty bad things: the Cardassians had the Occupation of Bajor and the Klingons were at war with the Federation and their culture is pretty warlike.

Then again, as Kirk, Picard, Janeway, and many other characters would be the first to point out, we humans have done some bad things too (like World War II for instance and):

* Not all humans are the same: some are good, some are bad, most are in between.
* We've improved.

Also, Be'Lanna claims that the idea that all Klingons are aggressive is a stereotype, yet she also is pretty fiery and blames it on being half-Klingon and when she's split into her human and Klingon sides, her human side isn't fiery.

Worf was raised by humans and is viewed by other Klingons as a sissy, yet he likes to play fighty games too (like sparring with bat'leths). Then again, this could simply be due to finding his culture very important.

Back to Cardassians, there was this one drug that ""expanded the xenophobia of Cardassians"". Does that imply that all Cardassians are xenophobic or would a significantly non-xenophobic be immune (much like how Stamets and Hugh would probably be immune to Orion slave girls)?

So with this we can see the affects of the various timelines between the shows.

Now onto Star Trek Picard, been watching the trailers and seen that some of the people on Youtube are a bit wrong, my opinion is that girl who comes up to Picard isn't his daughter or anything like people say, she comes to him because he's Locutus, or was Locotus and that everything 'inside her' (voices?) tell her that she'll be safe with him.

1021,My theory and why Klingons lose a lot of fights with Humans.,"So I have been thinking about this a lot lately.  Why would a warrior race lose a lot of hand to hand fights with humans, which aren't as highly trained or even as strong (besides not wanting to kill off main characters and the obvious plot devices)? The answer comes down to strength vs. speed.  

My theory boils down to this: Klingons have been selectively breeding to become bigger and stronger for a very long time.  Think about their fight style and duels.  They are pretty strait forward, face to face, and come down to who can over-power who.  So what would Klingon women find attractive? The stronger male and not the faster one.  It is considered honorable to be face to face and fight head on.  While they have their little dance beforehand rituals, there isn't  a lot of movement and dodging, more deflection and counter-attacking.  Using your strength to absorb and deflect their blow and striking when they are off balance.

Why does this matter? Well think how humans fight.  They are going to take any advantage they can and what would humans have that Klingons don't? Speed! Humans are going to use their speed to deliver their (sometimes fatal) blow.  So it may take a Klingon to recover a split second longer then a human which in a fight is almost an eternity.  

Maybe this is something that has been discussed on here or a novel.  I just thought it was worth a thought.",startrek,1573158445,XThrtLvLMidNiteX,42,1,True,2019-11-07

I have come to believe that the writers of Star Trek set the series in a universe in which WW3 happened so that we could learn from those mistakes and avoid such a horrific and destructive conflict.

1055,Riker held back a number of other officer's careers.,"Promotion has always been weird on star trek, but its clear that in the 24th century there were some (loose) time in grade requirements, as well as recommendation for promotion. Some ranks required a job to ""open up,"" such as captain. 

It's clear that Star Fleet saw XO of the Enterprise as a pipeline for up and coming officers to be given commands of their own. They tried several times to promote Riker. They tried to move Shellby into his place. However he stubbornly held on to his position ten years longer than anyone would expect. 

There were a few people on board who may have been eligible for the role. Data, La Forge, and Worf were all ""in the pipeline,"" so to speak. Crusher was eligible to command a medical ship, and troi was able to command the enterprise on occasion although that didn't seem to be her career goal.  

Data clearly had career ambitions, and was second officer, but he never had the opportunity to prove himself long-term as XO. 

La Forge (in one timeline) would move on to captain a ship, so he too had career ambitions toward command. 

Worf eventually had to make a lateral move to DS9 to move up in posting. 

The ship's science officer wasn't very ambitious and wasn't even included in many staff meetings. 

It was never clear to me why Riker wanted to stay. Defiance against his father's expectations? To stick around in case Diana developed feelings for him again? Comfort?

I cant get over how greatly immorale I find it for a lifeform to take over a hosts very being. To essentially take over the life of the host as if it's their own but only to absorb some knowledge and personality traits. Even setting that aside for a bit... 

They say it's a dual symbiotic relationship but Both beings don't at all seem to be in equally recognised. Dax, the Trill is the one they refer to ""them"" as. Where is this dual relationship if it's only the Trill they are talking to? 

But where does this leave The host, Jadzia anyway? Is their consciousness completely wiped out? Or blended? If Blended her being talked to as just the Trill doesn't make sense.  The host seems to come off as a mere meat puppet from my perspective. Since the only part of Jadzia that is recognised is the gender.

The federation and Klingon empire are weak after so many wars, there is civil war and constant fighting from Romulan space spilling over into federation and Klingon territories, and criminal organisations are increasingly a match for thinly stretched and overworked federation and Klingon starships. 

The story begins as a data, in a new body with seemingly human skin gasps for breath and sees an old woman sitting in front of him. The last thing he remembers is downloading his brain into b4. She explains that she is the great great granddaughter of Dr Soong and custodian of his work. She has created a new next generation body for Data with human like appearance and skin over an even stronger frame with increased emotional and mental abilities. Data's consciousness has been recovered with all memories intact and transferred from a now dismantled B4 who resides in a glass case on a wall like a display. He was never ""alive"" she says, he was simply the custodian of you katra if you like.

She explains that he is the first of a whole new race envisioned by Dr Soong. The ""eternans"" (eternal androids). That he intended for the eternans to be the benevolent ""custodians of the universe"", holding together the fabric of peace and cohesion where organics can only inevitably fail by their imperfect design and selfish desires. 

She explains that with data she has finally completed Dr Soongs work, and they are now able to create others, billions of individual eternans of all appearances, personalities and genders committed to Dr Soongs goal. 

To start their mission, she has decoded a Romulan intelligence disk revealing the location of a secret well resourced Tal Shiar facility where they made and tested next generation starships. She said that she and Data would go there to recover the star empires last Romulan warbird, and create a crew to man it.

But I don't hear anybody talk about Levar Burton as LaForge. I feel like he out of all of the TNG players might have been the most consistently good. Even Patrick Stewart had the odd misstep (I know its heresy to say that) perhaps because he was given more challenging material. 

But Levar Burton you could tell was always giving it 110%. He had so much energy and enthusiasm it was infectious and that's no small feat given the demands of the TNG working schedule.

Say what now Captain? 

Aren't the Borg exposed to individuality every time they assimilate people into the collective? Even if most Borg are grown, they assimilated Picard and Seven of Nine. Did their sense of individuality not infect the collective?

And yet we'll see indeed that for some reason this works. In ***Descent*** a bunch of Borg have been turned into individuals thanks to Hugh.

1090,How do you feel about the Prophets? What they did for the franchise?,"TNG basically portrayed all religion as false except Native American spiritual practices for some reason. If you're an atheist I imagine this was the series you're most comfortable with. You probably liked episodes like ""Who Watches the Watchers."" 

Then came Deep Space Nine and the revelation that the Prophets of the Bajoran religion were basically real. There was certainly something real inside that wormhole that the Bajorans were worshipping. Their Orbs worked, their prophecies tended to come true. The Bajoran religion is basically true in the context of the show. 

In fact its kind of strange given the evidence that more of the starfleet crew doesn't worship them. Atheists are as they are in real life due to a lack of evidence of the divine. I think most wouldn't continue to be atheists if there was a living Emissary to God, artifacts (orbs) that give you experiences with God, and a place you could actually go where God hangs out.

So Deep Space Nine flipped Star Trek on its head in a lot of ways, being stationary, having more continuity between episodes, having non Starfleet make up much of the cast, and having a religion turn out to be real.

1095,TIL that Shatner cross-eyed to make History,"William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols had a scene where they had to kiss, first interracial kiss, but the network producers said ""Shit, you can't do that, people won't receipt well that kiss because it's a black woman and a white guy"" so Shatner said ""Well, what about if we shoot 2 scenes, one with kiss and one without kiss""

So shooting the scene, Shatner was like ""That kiss didn't convinced, let's do it again..."" And again, and again, and again, and again they did that kiss until the producer said, ""William, we only have time for one more scene, let's film without the kiss NOW"" and they did.

When Shatner, Roddenberry and the producers watched the scene without the kiss, they saw that Shatner crossed his eyes (on purpose but that was later discovered) so he said, ""Well, then we have to do the scene with the kiss""

1097,So I finally watched Enterprise.,"I have had some free time on my hands recently so I am finally watching Enterprise after never giving it a go when it came out.

I do not regret my original decision and even feel a bit like I should have stuck to it.

Episodes particularly early on just went through the motions of recycling plots and stories from past series.

Others relied on riffing on previous series events and aliens like the Ferengi and Borg episodes, Archers trial on Qonos recreating whole shots and scenes from Undiscovered Country, Brent Spinners guest appearance – he should have just been an original character because ending with an allusion to Data just cheapens it.

The 'temporal cold war' was poorly developed, it was clearly just cooked it up to create a hook for the pilot and after that they had no idea what to do with it or where to go and just invoked it whenever a plot development was needed.

The tonal shift in the show as different producers and story editors came and went each season trying to retool and revive the show is also very noticeable. From typical Star Trek stand alone episodes of season 1-2, to trying to duplicate BSG in season 3, to deep lore in season 4. It grew disconcerting.

The Xindi attack was apparently meant to be an analogy for 9/11 and the GWOT, I guess I can see that and to their credit they handled the Xindi even handedly as a people with real motivations rather than being two dimensional villains. But they also had Archer successfully torturing someone. Torture has been featured in the past in Star Trek as something used by depraved villains and despotic regimes and we know in real life that torture does not work. Yet Archers effort worked just fine, he was ashamed of it but it worked. What kind of moral message does that send? Thats the sort of message the CIA would have us believe about their own efforts. Have Cardassian or Andorian efforts at torture been successful? Do Archers noble intentions make the difference - Cardassians and Andorians would argue their intentions were just.

To be consistent with the morals presented throughout Star Trek, not to mention reality, that should not have been done. It should have been depicted as providing no information or simply telling Archer what he wanted to hear to make it stop – that is the reality of torture as seen in the US Senates report on CIA torture, that it was [ineffective in generating intelligence](https://www.newsweek.com/torture-report-movie-cia-waterboarding-senate-enhanced-interrogation-guantanamo-detainees-1470223).

Particularly egregious was the awful sexual exploitation of the T'Pol character. Putting her in form fitting catsuits or skimpy undergarments and pyjamas bearing her cleavage and midrift, which she continued to wear even after joining starfleet but now with the ridiculous addition of a patch on the arm and rank on the shoulder. And the obnoxious ""titillating"" decontamination and massage scenes. Who was responsible for this, a 12 year old boy? Who did they think it would appeal to?

The relationship with Trip also wasn't believable, it simply didn't develop or show any reason for interest by either side and instead just happened.

I also found something very odd about the casting. Have a look at DS9 and Voyager: they had a very diverse multi-racial and gender cast. But have a look at Enterprise: all white guys, there is just 1 black guy and 1 asian woman. Which was not helped by the guy being a bad actor and the womans character being a shrinking violet, or that both were often given marginal roles. What's up with that?

I like the idea of an early years series, I liked some of things they did, I liked Dr Phlox being a change of pace from how such characters usually behaved.

But overall the people making this had some bad/tired ideas and no clear concept of what they wanted to do, maybe there were too many people in charge, maybe there was too much network or studio interference.",startrek,1573449910,Lamont-Cranston,77,1,True,2019-11-11

1099,"Voyager episode ""Timeless"" should have been a two part season finale / season opener ala ""Best of Both Worlds""","I was watching Timeless and although I liked it a lot, I feel it would have been much better as a two part episode spread across the finale of one season and the opener of the next. The finale could have taken place in the Voyager's present day, with them perfecting, installing, and testing the slipstream drive and then ending with the ship unexpectedly crashing onto the planet and being destroyed. Imagine the build up to the finale, implying that they're finally going to make it home, and then BAM, out of nowhere the episode ends with the ship crashing and everyone dying as Kim and Chakotay fly on, completely dismayed and horrified. Talk about an unexpected finish that leaves fans dying to know what will happen next. That would have been a hell of a cliffhanger just as shocking as Best of Both Worlds TNG. 

And then the second part opener would follow Kim and Chakotay 15 years later as they are fugitives from the Federation and their journey to aquire what they need in order to effectively send a message back through time to stop Voyager's destruction. That in and of itself would make for one hell of an exciting season opener. And then when it's all said and done and the episode ends with Voyager being saved.....man, what a journey from season to season. Vastly more poingant and memorable than the way it ended up.",startrek,1573463136,DoomsdayFAN,7,1,True,2019-11-11

1102,Today is Remembrance Day in Canada and the rest of the commonwealth so I wanted to highlight a Canadian War Hero known as James Doohan," James Doohan is not only a pop culture icon who helped teach us to explore strange new worlds and go boldly where no one has gone before. He’s also a Canadian hero of the last great war. 

Doohan was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the youngest of four children of Sarah Frances (née Montgomery) and William Patrick Doohan, who both emigrated from Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland. His mother was a homemaker. His father, born in Belfast, was a pharmacist, veterinarian and dentist, and a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. William Doohan owned a chemist shop in Main Street in Bangor, beside Trinity Presbyterian Church. Doohan's father reportedly invented an early form of high-octane gasoline in 1923. Doohan's 1996 autobiography recounted his father's serious alcoholism. Doohan's paternal grandfather, Thomas Doohan, was Head Constable in the Royal Irish Constabulary. 

The family moved from Vancouver to Sarnia, Ontario. Doohan attended high school at the Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School (SCITS), where he excelled in mathematics and science. He enrolled in the 102nd Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps in 1938. 

At the beginning of the Second World War, Doohan joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and was a member of the 14th (Midland) Field Battery, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He was sent to England in 1940 for training. 

The first Canadians reached Juno Beach at 7:35 AM and were cut down. Fortunately for them, the HMS Ajax had bombed Juno earlier, doing more damage to the coastal defenses than the planes had. After two hours, they had swept aside most of the Germans on their stretch of the beach. 

Doohan led his men across the sands and got lucky. Despite the anti-tank mines beneath their feet, none went off, as the men were not heavy enough to activate them. As they made their way to higher ground, Doohan managed to take out two German snipers – his first kills of the war. 

By noon, they had secured their positions. They could rest, as well as deal with their dead and wounded. There was, however, a problem. 

Although Doohan escaped the initial moments of the invasion relatively unscathed, his luck didn’t last: 

At about 11:20 that evening, Doohan finished a cigarette and patted the silver cigarette case he kept in his breast pocket. It had been given to him by his brother as a good luck charm… and a good thing, too. 

Some ten minutes later, he was walking back to his command post when he was shot. Six times. By a Bren Gun. The first four bullets slammed into his leg, the fourth whacked him in the chest, while the sixth took off his right middle finger. 

It was not a German sniper. He had been shot by a nervous, trigger-happy Canadian sentry. Fortunately, the cigarette case stopped the bullet aimed at his chest. Doohan later joked it was the only time being a smoker saved his life.  

When speaking about the experience James Doohan said the following “We landed safely, thank God, through those Y-shaped steel barriers you see in the film (Saving Private Ryan), tracer bullets, all that, none of our men hurt, and dashed 75 yards to the 7-foot tall dunes,” Doohan said.  

“Crossed a minefield, found out about it later: It was meant to blow up tanks, and we weren’t heavy enough. Moved up through a down – hardly a town just a village – called Graye Sur Mer, saw a church tower that was a machine-gun post, firing off to our left.  

Doohan took out the machine-gun post with a couple of shots. “I don’t know if they were killed or wounded, but it shut them up,” he said.  

His mother was told that German bullets had hit him at 11:30 p.m. on D-Day as he was returning from a forward gun position. He walked a quarter-mile – “the adrenaline lets you do it” – to the regimental aid post, Doohan said. He knew about his right hand and the whack on his chest against that cigarette case, but that was all. 

The medic said ""You also have four bullets in your left knee."" To which Doohan replied: ‘Well, I walked here.'” 

Doohan graduated from Air Observation Pilot Course 40 with eleven other Canadian artillery officers and flew Taylorcraft Auster Mark V aircraft for 666 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF as a Royal Canadian Artillery officer in support of 1st Army Group Royal Artillery. All three Canadian (AOP) RCAF squadrons were manned by artillery officer-pilots and accompanied by non-commissioned RCA and RCAF personnel serving as observers. 

Although he was never actually a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doohan was once labeled the ""craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Force"". In the late spring of 1945, on Salisbury Plain north of RAF Andover, he slalomed a plane between telegraph poles ""to prove it could be done""—earning himself a serious reprimand.  

After the war, he returned to Canada where he heard a radio drama. Believing he could do a better job than the voice actors, Doohan took up drama and earned a scholarship to New York City. 

His first job was with CBC radio on January 12, 1946. He would go on to do 4,000 shows on radio, 450 on TV, and earn a reputation as the most versatile voice actor in the business. 

It was in 1965, however, that he indeed entered history when he landed the role of Montgomery “Scotty” Scott in Star Trek. As well as playing the role of Chief Engineer for the Starship *Enterprise*, Doohan also helped develop the Klingon and Vulcan languages. 

He became so iconic that fans credit him with their interest in engineering, astronomy, and other technical fields. Among these was the engineer-turned-astronaut, Neil Armstrong, who personally thanked Doohan in 2004. 

Doohan died in 2005. To honor him, the SpaceLoft XL rocket took some of his ashes into space. Two years later, the Scottish town of Linlithgow claimed him as one of their own with a predictive commemorative plaque. “Predictive,” because it claims he will be born there on 2222. 

Thank you for your service James Doohan, and for everything after. You will be remembered along with hundreds of thousands of other brave men and women this Monday at the Eleventh Hour, of the Eleventh Day, of the Eleventh Month.  

I encourage all who read this to go out this today, buy a poppy, wear it proudly and attend a local Remembrance Day ceremony and be sure to remember those lost in the service to their nations every day of the year.

1103,A question regarding the watch order of TOS(first time watcher),"I can assume that a question like this one has been asked many times before but I would like to make sure that I don't miss a single scene so, here I go:

&amp;#x200B;

I have started watching Star Trek on Netflix and didn't know that I should have skipped the Pilot episode. Thus I was really confused as I progressed through the season. Then I read that 'The Menagerie' episodes would make things clear for me. I am currently more than halfway through the first part and the salvaged scenes from the pilot episode have just begun. Would I miss any extra scenes if I were to skip over those scenes(since I've watched them like several days ago and remember them pretty well)? Do the scenes continue on to the second part?(I didn't check because I didn't want to be spoiled should they don't.)

1104,O'Brien's and Bashir's best friendship (Irish and English) served as proof that the Cardassian and Bajoran people could one day heal their relationship and perhaps even be friends.,"I think if any Bajoran or Cardassian happened to research the history of Earth and then put one and two together, it may have been enlightening. Kira has some knowledge of Ireland as she mentions it to O'Brien in one or two episodes. But, here we have two members of two Earth ethnic groups who very much had a similar relationship at one time to the Cardassian and Bajoran people. Even though the major inspiration of the Bajoran's are the Jews being exterminated in WW2 A lot of Bajor very much resembles Ireland as a whole throughout history. You had men like Charles Trevelyan who was a powerful British politician who had sway in Ireland, whose views were very much parallel a certain Cardassian Gul. 

 ''**If the Irish once find out that there are any circumstances in which they can get free government grants, we shall have a system of mendicancy \[begging\] such as the world never knew”. After a million had starved to death he stated** ''**The judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated, the great evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine, but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.'' - Charles Trevelyan**

**'' You can’t trust the Irish, they are all liars''  -Margaret Thatcher**

**''The Irish hate our order, our civilization, our enterprising industry, our pure religion. This wild, reckless, indolent, uncertain and superstitious race have no sympathy with the English character. Their ideal of human felicity is an alternation of clannish broils and coarse idolatry. Their history describes an unbroken circle of bigotry and blood'' -**  **Disraeli.** 

Then you have a similar quote with elements of the above quotes by Gul Dukat.

 **''Of Course I hated them! I hated everything about them! Their superstitions, and their cries for sympathy, their treachery and their lies. Their smug superiority and their stiff-necked obstinacy. Their earrings, and their broken, wrinkled noses!''  I should have killed them all and turned their planet into a graveyard the likes the Galaxy has never seen -Gul Dukat** 

And centuries later we have two members of these two former enemies as best of friends on DS9, even today the relationship between the average English and Irishman is quite good.

1120,Xindi prototype trench irregularity,"I can't help but ponder the geographical error of the Xindi prototype weapons path of destruction.

Not to mention after measuring on Google maps even a straight line from the top of Florida to the bottom of Venezuela doesn't equal 4000 km, while the visuals have the weapon start somewhere in the middle of Florida.

Which of these explanations do you think is most likely (or if you have any better ideas please share them):

1. The different timeline of the 'Trek universe with different wars and conflicts made Venezuela's borders change to match that of the path the beam took. A bit of a hand-wave but may add something to the universe, showing that the results of WW3 and the Eugenics wars were still present rather than all countries have the same borders they have today.
2. While the beam trench does look like a straight line it did change course, or at least curve slightly, and swerve towards Venezuela. The probe emitter had rapidly spinning parts and we never see it's path past Cuba so this isn't too far-fetched.
3. Out of universe explanation. It was simply the result of the artist and writer teams not talking too each other clearly enough and/or not consulting geography too closely.",startrek,1569689139,Evil-Tree,7,6,True,2019-09-28

From what I understand, it requires you to stand in a tiny area and the only benefit is that you see a 3D projection of a person. Why would you trade the ability to move free around the bridge and communicate via the screen for this? 

I can't imagine Picard or anyone walking to a holobooth or whatever and standing there (especially wounded after a fight) because they need to communicate with another ship.

The same goes for Odo or Bashir. Imagine Defiant is calling them to ask about some detail -- instead of just responsing, are they supposed to walk to ops and stand in a small circle?

And are some of the captains more privileged than others? Sisko can sit comfy in a chair while the other captain had to patiently stand in the designated area.

Of her Star Trek knowledge, I do not think she knows much (her family didn't watch much of it and she's not a nerdy-ish type).

So I tried to watch TNG and I couldn’t keep my attention with it. I though it weird, I have ds9 on dvd and must’ve watched it 4 times.

Now the last few months have been really busy and I’ve been having trouble getting into new shows and books. It’s all fast and hard to follow. And Netflix told me I might like TNG. So I watched some..

And I’ve come home again. It’s not fast, it’s even slow at times. But it’s taking the time to show crew playing cards, making omelets of eggs from a far away planet. With Worf making faces because it’s not moving..

1130,Was the 'Force of Nature' TNG episode (S7E9) ahead of its time?,"I'm watching through TNG for the first time, and am now nearing the end point. I've often noticed episodes which project morals that have aged really well, and of course some that don't. I found *Force of Nature* to be a very entertaining episode, despite a perhaps casual subplot of Data and Spot, and Geordi and his competition. But I found the idea of something as fundamental as warp drive *polluting* space an interesting concept. I doubt that future episodes/series adhered to this concept, but it was a stark reminder that change is often necessary.

Of course, it also draws a paralell to climate change, and greenhouse gases. So when I checked ratings and reviews, I was surprised to see that a lot of people didn't like the episode at all, and called it ""preachy."" That certainly wasn't my reaction. So I wonder, was this episode ahead of its time?

I know the early/mid 90's was aware of climate change and plenty of research done about the subject, but I wonder if this episode would fare better with today's audiences or not?

Despite the rest of the crew growing accustomed to and even a bit fond of Tuvix, the decision is still made to, effectively, execute him.

Imagine showing the mirror voyager, the ship is in terrible shape, the crews almost dead from raiding local species instead of allying with them. Doing anything possible to get home but there bullheaded tactics have lost every opportunity they’ve had from jumping the gun and instead they’ve suffered more casualties from their failures than voyagers approach. This would show that without a doubt voyager usually makes the right choices in each situation. 


They even could’ve kept the overall plot mirror voyager could even keep the same plot and it'd work. The aliens equinox was killing brought the mirror voyager here, its dwindling crew explain that they're from another dimension and the same plot plays out mostly. The mirror characters would play nice, secrets would be exposed and they'd try to take our voyager.

  I've now seen TNG &amp; up to S05 of DS9.  One question I have: why don't either side use bioweapons?  Biological weapons are the most potent form of warfare imaginable.

Even now, in our primitive sciences compared to Star Trek, we have binary bio-weapons that can wipe out entire population subsets within months, especially if let dormant for the first stage and accelerated with a catalyst 2nd stage.  

  So why aren't bioweapons created to take out anyone with Jem Hardar DNA?  Borg DNA?  It seems odd to me that the federation isn't using very commonplace and well known weapons.

 Bioweapons allow you to complete;y conquer an area without damaging the ecosystem or infrastructure.

So why aren't they used?

This is such a small thing but thought wanted to share! There is a scene later in the episode when they manage to buy the Enterprise some time before they jump to warp. Transporter Chief Rosmer talks to Captain Picard and then Ro and LaForge breathe a sigh of relief, then right after as Ro is talking LaForge looks away for a second. For some reason I always remember this... now from viewing the episode in hi-def I think I know the reason: it's because the actor who plays Rosmer is probably in chuckles!

Instead we get earth 1996 as it would be for us. No mention of the wars, efforts to rebuild, political climate or the Augments themselves.

I was under the general impression that star trek history was the same as ours up until the 1990’s then everything went to hell until first contact with the Vulcans.

I'm simply curious about who y'all think has the best acting chops in TNG? and can you provide any particular examples?

It is probably safe to say that Patrick Stewart has the widest range here, but as the focal point of the show he is obviously going to get more screentime than others. His stellar (pun fully intended) performances in S3 E26/S4 E1 ""The Best of Both Worlds"" stand out for me.

To highlight someone with less screentime, I've always been incredibly impressed by Dwight Schulz's TNG fav Lt. Reginald Barclay. He manages to portray a character that makes my heart melt every time without fail, and much more convincing acting in general, even compared to the show's regulars.

Honorable mention to Brent Spiner's Lt. Commander Data, as he is able to pull out the performance of a lifetime portraying a character without emotion and a severe lack of facial expression and still make Data one of the most beloved relatable characters in the whole franchise.

1236,"DS9 Season 3: Episodes 11 and 12: Past Tense. Written for a different time, but is it still a feasable concern today? Do you think they were totally out-to-lunch?","Past Tense is a two part episode, written in 1995, and directed in part by the man Jonathen Frakes. In the episode Commander Sisko, Dr. Bashir and Jatzia (jotsia, jat see ya, whatever who cares the pretty  one with spots)are wonderously transported to the year 2024, to a regular looking american city, and the men are promptly found and arrested by what appears to be police officers dressed up for the ghostbuster academy. The two are found without I.D, and thrrefore they are brought to a detention center (processing center), Where their hand print scanners and facial recognition software fails to turn up an american identity for them. They are informed they need to apply for a visa and find work, and are promptly released into a walled 'sanctuary district' where it is clear they are never going to score an interview.

Benjie and Jules decide to poke around and comment on how sad it is the mentally ill and socially deviant are treatdd this way, and how 'humans and cardassians really cant be so different after all..."" (Sure just keep those spoonheads out of my country, amiright? Except Garak. Lower the pitchforks, we all love Garak.) Meanwhile Dax is running around being all high class sexy, and convincing basically a silicon valley communications business man that he should help her find her friends.

Basically long story short they fuck up the timelines and basically have to do some time line maintaining shit, hold some people hostage, get some people killed, cameo a guy from I think frasier or seinfeld or cheers or something, cops bust in, shots fired, sisko dead but not, colm meany and kira eventually stop dicking around with hippys and the crew returns home to find shits all good now on to the next adventure.

I think we can all agree, our cops dont look like ghostbusters. Also, although detroit may appear a dystopean wasteland we havent walled it up yet and thrown prisoners in. However, personally I noticed the plot and the fears seem a little less far fetched to me nowadays. Granted, the episode was aired in 1995, and so I was five, im sure it must have used exaggeration of their events as a tool to talk about their problems. I guess what I noticed was that i was bothered how they seemed to have gotten a few things right. 

As it is in 2019, facial recognition is here, and governments are using it. People without identification are essentially being told to go through the process of immigration the right way, then being placed in cinditions that are nearly inescapable. (I think of refugees in australian prisons, and mexican people held up in detention centers, and uygher camps where they government is essentially trying to put people away and forget.) And also locking up the mentally ill and trying to forgrt about them aswell.

If you were someone old enough to watch the episodes when they came out and understand their context, did you believe the world would turn out the way they predicted or not? If your like me, and too young to remember it in context, do you see it paralleling our current world, or the world 5 years from now? Do you believe the world could ever look like that for us?

Personally I think it is an interesting episode. I cant imagine America or my country (Canada), ever really looking like that, but at the same time I know that the ""hide the undesirables"" does go on in our world, and big brother is absolutely a reality. Do you see any other mirrors to our world? Or funny shit they were way wrong about. (I mean those clothes, and that huge computer desk thing)

I'm intrigued by the sudden change from Pike to Kirk (story wise and off camera) and the way Spock is so... ... ... different. He smiles and talks with such excitement... Quite a contrast to what we (later learn) know of a Vulcan persona.

Is this episode canon?
(I assume it is because it's listed as episode 1 of season 1)

What happened to rest of the crew?

Do they ever explain this in other episodes?

I really enjoyed the second episode (introducing Kirk and the crew) but would have been nice to reference the previous crew also (seeing as Spock is I'm both... but very different)",startrek,1570044837,MoNKeY-HoRDe,20,0,True,2019-10-02

I just realized that Sabotage also plays during the intro to going Kirk, when he wrecks the Corvette. This made me like it even more.

What's strange, though, is that I suddenly find these movies much easier to enjoy. I think it's because the larger Trek universe is shifting back to a more ""prime timeline"" focus. 

I can now consider the JJ films silly ""Elseworlds"" type stories, rather than the future of all Star Trek. From that perspective, they're actually pretty fun.",startrek,1570054011,overslope,25,0,True,2019-10-02

1251,Quark's speeches really make you think. [SPOILERS],"Over the course of DS9 you see Quark, who starts off as what you would expect from your basic Ferengi - turn into one of the most well played and written supporting characters in the show he teaches you a thing or two over the shows 7 seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarks Speech about the Ferengi:**

\[Link: [**https://youtu.be/zNu1cdISsvY?t=57**](https://youtu.be/zNu1cdISsvY?t=57) \] I could only find a high quality video of that speech from a video about inspirational speeches of Star Trek (Its an amazing video a definite recommend to watch.)

This speech gives us the perspective of a Ferengi and how others view their race when in all honesty we were either the same or as he argues worse. The Ferengi race is viewed very badly by many Star Trek fans especially when they were first introduced in TNG and they are viewed badly by most people in the Trek universe; but I believe Quark is correct, humans despise Ferengi because Quark is right, Humans did do much worse in the past and the Ferengi are a reminder of what we were (Or even are today in the real world.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Quark Speech about Greed - A big eye opener for me:**

\[Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zEBGpr4YYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zEBGpr4YYA)  \] I believe this speech cuts out a bit early, but its what I found.

Greed is viewed as a bad trait both in Star Trek and society today, but Quark is right - Greed is necessary in an imperfect society. In a society that can't band together in perfect harmony and strive to be better than itself; greed is the true motivator for people to do better and be better in order to be successful thus driving innovation and goals for people and society.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarks Speech about the Federation:**

\[Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ) \] Low quality, but again the one I found.

I enjoyed this speech because it gave us a unique perspective about how others view the Federation and makes you think.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarks Speech about Humanity:**

\[Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2SHNqkjbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2SHNqkjbY) \]

Honestly one of my favorite speeches of Trek because it accurately describes us as a people. It definitely makes you think.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:** 

Anyways I just thought I would share some of my reasons why I believe Quark and on a extended note Deep Space Nine is amazing. Please feel free to add your opinion and comments on the speeches, I would love to hear them :)",startrek,1570074040,Diehard129,0,1,True,2019-10-02

1265,What series (or episodes) would be best to introduce someone to star trek who currently has zero interest in anything sci-fi or not firmly set in reality?,"I am a trekkie through and through, grew up watching TNG and Voyager and throughout my adult life I have had one series or another on constant play in my down time. However, my other half has no interest in it whatsoever. He likes historical things, war programmes, crime, thrillers etc. He really doesn't enjoy anything that's not strictly 'real', and he's been around when I've been watching the end of an episode every now and then and he just completely zones out, makes no effort to get into it at all. We've been together almost 15 years and he has never shown any interest in star trek whatsoever, so I either watch when he's not around or when he's sleeping. It works well enough, I get my fix several times a week so I'm happy. HOWEVER. A few days ago, he asked me something I thought I'd never hear. He asked, if he was going to watch it which one should he start with?

Imagine my surprise!

I was genuinely so shocked I didn't even know what to say, I started rattling through, well, start at the beginning but TOS is really dated now but it's still good but you'd have to accept it looks old and cheesey at times, or DS9 because it's more war based so maybe more down your street but it references so many other things that have happened previous you won't appreciate it as much, or Discovery as it's the latest one so more modern and less likely to put you off by looking dated but again references older series'....
He followed quickly with just because he's asking doesn't mean it's going to happen. But just asking the question feels like such a massive step all the same, I feel like I need to be prepared! 

But you see my dilemma.

I feel like this is a really risky opportunity. I have one shot to get him hooked (or at least not put him off forever).

I wondered if maybe the new films might be a good place to start, but they're less 'trek' than the series' so not necessarily an ideal introduction (and they're also incidentally the only trek things I've not really watched properly). 

My real issue is that I hate doing things out of order, so even when I watch through the series I normally just bash through each series in full, in order, from TOS through to Enterprise then rinse and repeat. My biggest barrier is starting him midway through something! But equally, I don't think he'll be into the old school TOS (or even early TNG) stuff. 

HELP! 

Have any of you been through this? What worked, and what didn't? 
Any suggestions at all would be appreciated!

I wonder, since the Borg assimilated the ablative armor technology brought from the future, it was scrapped as an anti-Borg tech, and the Borg ended up adapting to the Transphasic Torpedoes as well.

Nothing about the Vesta-class makes me think it could go toe-to-toe with a Borg cube or any Borg ship, but in the article on the Vesta it's implied that it could hold it's own.

Is it possible odo infected him as well? Laas wasn't part of the great link so Odo didn't cure him as well.,startrek,1570153562,jressler24,6,0,True,2019-10-03
1271,Amok Time and Older Depictions of Vulcans,"I'm watching through TOS right now, in the final leg of my quest to watch all major installments of Trek, and I've just gotten to Amok Time, and I gotta say, I think it's a little sad that the representation of Vulcans seems to have become homogenized as Spock became the breakout character for Trek. I say this primarily because we see Vulcans with hair that isn't that godawful bowl cut thing that they're always rocking in TNG onwards, Tuvok excepted (to an extent). Both T'Pau and T'Pring are rocking these long braided hairdos, but years later in Enterprise, we see T'pol following in Spock's visual style with her short hair, which, granted, gets looser as the show progresses. 

I am, of course, speaking mostly in a meta sense, I'm not really interested in the in-canon explanation for it. I suppose the pointed ears were enough to tell the audience that Vulcans were Vulcans in TOS, and they had to be made more visually iconic when other races got added, but it gave a pretty flat visual impression for later Vulcans.",startrek,1570154278,Cook_0612,9,20,True,2019-10-03

1274,Let's brainstorm some potential Pike series names!,"We know the Pike series is coming, so I think it would be fun to brainstorm and try to guess some potential Pike series titles.

Personally I DO NOT believe that it should focus on Pike (just like how ST: Picard focuses on Picard). They shouldn't do that. They have years of character development for Picard to focus on. Whereas Pike, almost nothing. 

* Star Trek: (Christopher) Pike (Chronicles)
 * Not really good as it implies a focus on Pike, which probably isn't interesting, it should focus more on the adventures of his ship and crew.

* Star Trek: 1701
 * I like this, but it sounds cryptic, like to some random person ""what the hell does 1701 mean?"". I think this title would be good for an anthology series. It can be like Doctor Who which was cancelled back in 1989-ish and brought back in 2005. Same series, same canon, just different stories for different time periods. For now, they can focus on Pike's command, at some point they can do a prequel to Robert April, they can go to Harriman, Garrett, (maybe even Va'kel Shon if they want to make him canon?). But the main focus would be the adventures of the Enterprise and her crew throughout history. If they want to cancel the series, cool, just bring it back with a new production team, just like Doctor Who in 2005.

* Star Trek: The Lost Era/Years
 * Not fond of this, ""Lost Era"" or ""Lost Years"" is ambiguous. There are many eras in Star Trek which we know nothing about, and by the time the series is over, it is no longer a lost era, and what happens if you want to visit another Lost Era?

* Star Trek: (The) Menagerie
 * Obviously a callback to The Menagerie, but this would imply that Pike's adventures are just an illusion. A stupid title TBH.",startrek,1570162913,intrepid48,20,2,True,2019-10-04

First, he seems completely unaware that anybody would feel camaraderie with Data. His attitude is blatantly condescending.

Second, he comes across as Ill-prepared to justify himself or his arguments when Picard questions him about the distinction he draws with Data.

Third, he’s completely ignorant of the legal ramifications. Picard’s argument rests upon the external perceptions of the event. “Won’t we be judged by how we treat that race?” Maddox hasn’t seemed to consider the worst case scenario that Data is sentient and Maddox kills him.

1283,Which alien races could be next to receive a redesign?,"... and what could they look like?

This was inspired by the frequent talk about the cosmetic changes that happened to the Klingon race over the course of various Star Trek seasons. While there are several attempted in-universe explanations as to why they look so different in their various incarnations, the most likely reason is simply that, in the writer's intentions, Klingons always looked like in their most recent incarnation (DIS at the time of this writing) and that makeup technology and budget needed time to catch up. And I can totally see them saying the same about many other aliens.

I thought it would make for a fun experiment to consider what other races could receive the same treatment in the future, wether for good or bad, and what they could end up looking. *

I'll start by proposing the Andorians. Their look is iconic, but also fairly silly. I could totally see their future portrayal becoming less human like, for example by doing away with their hairs in favour of more complex makeup and prosthetics for the antennae, maybe hiding their ears so that it appears that the antennae serve an auditory function as well.

Another safe bet is the Gorn. They already sort of got it in Enterprise, but I'm expecting future incarnations to be even less humanoid and more like something that came out of InGen labs.

* please note that this thread is not for discussing if changing the appearance of an iconic alien species is good or not, just which one will be next to be redesigned to better suit a modern audience, at least in theory.",startrek,1570210469,Top_Score_0,22,6,True,2019-10-04
1284,"Under-appreciated episode: TNG's S3E3 ""The Survivors.""","I just re-watched this episode today. After getting all teary-eyed at the end, I decided to google it to read some other reviews, only to discover that apparently lots of people think this is a ""skippable"" episode? It's apparently too boring and as usual no one likes Troi. 

Personally, while certainly it's no ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" I feel this is a solid episode in the grandest tradition of Star Trek. 

The episode revolves are around a very strange central mystery. The Enterprise responds to a distress signal from a human colony, and arrives to find the colony totally destroyed, save one pristine home with an elderly coupling living in it. A side story begins to unfold in which Troi is being slowly driven mad by creepy music box music constantly playing in her head. 

There is very little action or excitement, save a few attacks from a mystery alien ship. The episode moves slowly. There are many quiet conversations. Picard is at his most Picard-y: empathetic yet skeptical, annoyed yet clearly intrigued by mystery. 

Like many great Star Trek episodes the ending largely resolves around a moral question: is pacifism justifiable even in the face of a hostile enemy? When the mystery is finally resolved you feel the full weight of this question on the alien's moral compass. You feel the grief and terrible guilt the alien feels over what has happened. The actor gives an excellent delivery. Ultimately no answer is given; the Enterprise moves on with the understanding that some things in the universe are above their pay grade. 

Is it a perfect episode? No. Is everything about it wrapped up in a neat little bow? No. But it is the type of episode that makes you feel, and gives you the space to think.

It seems like explanations are hated now. What happened between the last series or movie and Discovery that adapted the whole ""ignore continuity, accept artistic license"" thing?

Visited a Star Trek filming location this week: The Club Ed movie &amp; television set, near Lancaster, California.  
First noticed the place on the Windows 10 screen saver, where a photo of ""Bob's Hi-Way Service"" station appears in rotation. Researched it, and discovered that it's a movie &amp; TV set, called ""Club Ed,"" built in 1990 for a long-forgotten Dennis Hopper movie (""Eye of the Storm""). It was so well-built, it has been kept intact ever since as a set for film and TV production, and photo shoots.  
It's located along a lonely 2-lane back road, and when we drove up at dawn, we were greeted by a surreal sight: A shabby, run-down 1950s gas station, cafe, motel, and garage, sitting in the middle of the desert. But none of the businesses were real, and never had been. It was all Hollywood, sitting and weathering in the Mojave.  
I was delighted to discover the site was featured as a Star Trek setting in the 1996 ***Star Trek: Voyager*** episode ""Death Wish"" (ST:VOY s2e18). In that episode, The Q attempt to show Capt. Janeway a representation of the Q Continuum that her mind could comprehend, and this desert rest stop was what Q showed her.  
In the episode, the cafe building featured a sign reading, ""We Never Close"" and a Galaxy pinball machine, which are gone now. The building was painted a different color back then -- it's aqua now -- and the nonfunctional gas pumps have been changed out, but it's definitely the same place where Q said they had ""all been the scarecrow, big deal.""  
This is the second Star Trek location we've visited, after visiting nearby Vasquez Rocks last year. I feel like a pilgrim visiting holy Star Trek shrines.  
Club Ed is not set up for tourists, and there are big ""No Trespassing"" signs and chains across the entry drives. Park on the road, but don't enter the property. A caretaker is on site to chase off the looky-loos.  
Which he did. We're sorry.

Tom and B'Ellana felt forced to me, like it was written into the show out of nowhere. Harry Kim was the first starfleet officer to gain B'Ellana's relative trust and also the first to see her in an emotional/vulnerable state.

They duck/cower a lot. This is also a great way to avoid getting shot. 

On a strategic level, they cheat. As the old saying goes “All’s fair in love and war”

Consider the following quotes about the US military. 

“A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.”
– Soviet observation during the Cold War

""The reason the U.S. Navy does so well in wartime is that war is chaos, and the U.S. Navy practices chaos on a daily basis.""

There are many strategic advantages to being unpredictable. 


About motivation to fight: I’ve always wondered why there is war in a post scarcity society. Everyone has all that they want. What does it matter who is the ruler? Only a minority of races would be motivated to engage in war and they would be motivated not by scarcity but by ideology or religion. The Klingons go to war to go to heaven. They cannot go to heaven without war. Thus they are motivated to fight even if they have all they need in terms of material possessions. The Ferengi are motivated by profit and cannot go to heaven without it. Even if they have all that they need in terms of material possessions they need.

**Short Trek #5 - ""Q &amp; A""**

* This is the first installment of Star Trek with a title containing the word ""Q"" without featuring Q himself. Two other episodes, ""The Quality of Life"" and ""The House of Quark,"" both contain capital Qs but not the popular antagonist.
* We don't know precisely when this episode takes place, but it is between 2250, when Robert April was last in command of the Enterprise, and 2254, the year of ""The Cage."" Spock's early career is muddy, with some TOS dialogue saying he entered the Academy around 2250 and some saying he graduated that year.
* The text on Number One's padd is a memo essentially dictating what she's saying, and concerns ""quantum-stochastic models"" of combat. Her and Spock touch on this subject during their conversation.
* Although updated visually, the general look of the Enterprise transporter room is faithfully recreated, with shapes and lights resembling how it looked in TOS.
* Spock recites his serial number: S-179-276SP. This comes from ""Court Martial.""
* When Spock says ""reporting for dutYYY"" his inflection is reminiscent of traditional naval speech...as well as how Spock talked in ""The Cage."" His tendency to smile in this short also matches his mannerisms in TOS' earliest episodes.
* Professor Onafuwa has not been mentioned in the franchise. A googling reveals no obvious candidates for real-world references.
* Number One calls down to engineering and gets Upjohn, who speaks with a clear Scottish accent. Of course. ""An Obol for Charon"" establishes the Enterprise at that time has a chief engineer ""in love with *his* ship;"" Upjohn sounds female, so this is probably a different person.
* It is of interest to note that Pike is already being described as one of the most decorated captains in Starfleet.
* Pike's love for horses comes from ""The Cage,"" although I'm pretty sure this was already referenced in DIS.
* Replicator systems mentioned include references to ""Gupta"" and ""Katzman,"" which do not appear to be in-universe references.
* Spock attempts to discuss the questionable ethics and logic of the Prime Directive. It would seem that even in the 23rd century, officers can see the flaws behind this malleable, hazy law.
* The two discuss the beauty of Delta Scuti-type stars. This is a variable star that astronomers rely on to gauge intragalactic distances; they cite 99 Pegasi as an example, and in real life this star is indeed a variable.
* The rescue mission at ""Ling Plateau"" is not a reference that I'm aware of.
* Number One sings the ""Major-General's Song"" from Pirates of Penzance. This was the song that Crusher goaded Geordi into attempting in ""Disaster"" (after which they were also both trapped together). It's notable that Zach Quinto, who plays Spock in the Kelvin films, performed this song on stage.

**Nitpicks**

* This short continues DIS' artistic choice of portraying turbolift shafts as cavernous abysses with no visible top or bottom. There is little possibility that a ship like the Enterprise could contain such a feature; it would mean that the vessel is essentially hollow. Additionally, the turbolift ride is fairly long *before* it breaks down, and Amin is rappelling down ""from Deck 9."" The transporter room would have to be at the very bottom and back of the ship to justify the length of such a trip. This second part is not necessarily an explicit error, and may in fact be a reference to all the *other* times in which the turbolift moves at the speed of plot.",startrek,1570369756,Antithesys,23,20,True,2019-10-06

It doesn't seem to be Betazed as well (at least in comparison to what we've seen in Ménage à Troi for example).

What's the alternative? Holodeck onboard USS Titan.
The producers surely know how to make misleading trailers – and in my opinion it's possible, that they haven't missed a great opportunity to do just that.

Jonathan Frakes said sometime ago, that they are not in military anymore? Not really, the exact quote (in response to a question about the relation between Riker and Troi) was:
&gt; ""I can’t obviously tell you, but Marina and I… Well, you’ll see where we are. We’re together, and it’s quite… it’s non-military. I’ll say that.""

Would he be so criptic, if they would just settle on Earth or Betazed? I don't think so. And I don't think that the producers would miss the chance to create and show us the Titan (at least I hope they wouldn't).",startrek,1570377249,r3m0frost,25,5,True,2019-10-06

It just seems so long ago to be against my general aesthetic liking. Based on advice from a friend I had started with enterprise. Moved to voyager after not liking early tng. I finished ent and voy. I loved them so much. Went back to tng and have come around to loving it as well. I prefer janeway and archer to Picard but I’ve slowly learned to love Picard (not as much as riker though)

1374,Have the Picard Trailers Revealed Too Much?,"&amp;#x200B;

So from the trailers I've learned the following things: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Picard has retired to his Vineyard following a horrible experience leading a top-secret, unauthorized rescue mission, possibly relating to the destruction of Romulus.
2. Picard appears to be somewhat famous to the general public doing media interviews years after his Starfleet career has ended. 
3. While chilling on his vineyard, Picard is approached by a mysterious young woman named Dajh who needs his help.
4. Picard asks Starfleet to provide this help. They refuse. He gathers a motley crew together and   
does it anyway on a rogue mission. 
5. The crew includes a pilot, a scientist, a couple of Romulans and a few other Federation outcasts. 
6. Dajh's request for help has something to do with the Borg and the Romulans, who are apparently holding former Borg captive on a prison ship.  It seems pretty obvious that at least part of this mission is to break these people free. Somehow this situation is an allegory for immigration and refugees in the modern world. Maybe the Borg collective has disbanded and millions of former drones are returning to their homelands?
7. Somehow Hugh the Borg is involved in all of this. Maybe accidentally or intentionally Hugh implemented the plan to destroy the Borg discussed in in the episode ""I, Borg"". 
8. Dajh has some sort of savior or messiah like status. She's special for some reason. She also appears to have super-human abilities. 
9. Soong type androids have been produced en masse. Dajh may or may not be a Soong/Borg hybrid. 
10. Data appears, but it seems only in Picard's dreams. 
11. Riker and Troi appear in the first season. Riker has retired to what looks like Alaska, or at least the closest to Alaska one can get while filming in California. 
12. Seven of Nine is in the show and she's working to better the lives of former borg like herself. She's probably deep in the same issues Dajh and Picard have been dealing with. Jeri Ryan appears to have invented some sort of anti-aging device and has chosen to not share it with the rest of us. She's leaving billions on the table.
13. The saucer section of the Enterprise-D still exists. Maybe it's on a holodeck. But probably in a museum somewhere. 
14. Marin County is no longer a primarily a low-density residential area in the 24th century, but has been instead been potmarked by rather ugly skyscrapers. 
15. The Romulans are using old-school ships for some reason. 
16. The show will be action heavy, lots of ship battles and hand-to-hand combat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know the game here is to drive subscriber numbers.  And I'm sure there will be a few surprises left for the actual series. But doesn't it seem like we've already learned too much?

1385,Federexit? A Brits theory on Star Trek Picard (Spoilers),"As a Brit, there is really no escaping this at the moment. So one of the first things that came to mind when I saw the flag was Brexit, or rather Federexit if you will. 

I thought about a major power leaving the federation and becoming a bit more isolationist. Maybe even Earth. Limiting the free movement of people (not of Brexit and Trump here) which is why you don’t seem to see a litany of aliens wandering around any of the Starfleet HQ, or Earth shots... seems very human. 

The isolationism could explain why Riker has retired, and why Admiral NotNecheyev tells him its not his thing anymore?

The collapse of the federation might also explain a little about how the Romulans have been allowed to get away with their implied Borg Testing. 

I also wondered if this could tie into the Romulus Rescue mission, and may be Picard used his contacts and influence to run the mission without approval, as it was against Earths stance, OR they seceded from the Federation after that mission to avoid the influx of immigrants from Romulus?

Patrick Stewart has very strong views on Brexit, so it might be why he’s so interested in the story.

This is a story better placed in things like Halo which already had an insurrection, star wars which has an empire fall every trilogy, battlestar galactica which had humanity destroyed by its own creation and pretty much any other (bar stargate tbh) Sci fi series.

I'm not a fan of this dark bleak outlook. That is not what I am in star trek for.

We had:
Enterprise: The formation of the federation and witnessing humanity's push to succeed against all odds
TOS: Space cowboys with the federation in its formative years
TNG: Almost peak federation
VOY: A lone captain using the federations ideals to keep her crew together and alive while they try to get home
DS9: Trouble in paradise. A federation struggling to maintain its peaceful stance in a time of all out war. Trying to maintain its morality in arguably a worse encounter than the borg. (this is the kick off point where I would say we get our modern iterations of trek)

Now we have:
DSC: Still the cowboy years, but this time with some pretty hurrendous warcrimes. It shows that space is the size of the UK as it happens that burnham is the sister of spock and that the enterprise wasn't too far away. Now they're jumping into the future, 200 years after we have latest seen in ENT and the federation has gone fucked. Just collapsed into 6 planets. (And of course discovery is going to be what saves it...)

Picard: ehm, I'm not sure yet. Seems to be an advancement of the evil admirals he has always bee fighting. The ma's sproduction of soong class androids isn't good though. But with other threads discussing the exit of the colonies starting now I sure as fuck hope not.

I'm not making this thread to shit on shows I haven't seen yet. But currently in my real life I am living through brexit, mutters of more troubles and another indipendence referendum. I am just a young man trying to make it through his studies.

I use star trek as a means of escape, to have a window into a potential future once all this bullshit is over.

I sure as hell don't need it to slap me in the face with the most obvious referances to current events to ever be shat out of the writers room. Trek has always referanced real life, but never so bloody on the nose.

I'm sorry, I look like one of those crazy people... The ones that hate the shows just for existing but that's not the case. I'm just tired of people changing shit and calling it modernization.

1402,More 4K Upscaling Tests for Voyager,"Following hot on the trail of /u/Captrobau and his excellent upscaling tests, I thought I'd give Voyager another shot using the latest version of GigaPixel AI.

The results, which are [here](https://youtu.be/L1Zz2t-B0vk) are interesting to say the least.

The most obvious issue I can see is a mistake on my part. The new version of the app has an option for 'face refinement' which I enabled and had thought would help help upscaled faces look more natural (they can often look strange around the eyes), but it seems that what it actually does is to dynamically recreate new faces (presumably from a set of pre-made face captures) in places where the details of a face are way too blurred.

It should be pretty obvious to spot, keep an eye on the background actors. It made me laugh, but yeah, that approach is a no-go.

The only other concern I have with the approach is the grain that appears on the upscaled version. It looks quite false.
It just so happens that Topaz Labs have an amazing Denoiser which works absolute wonders and can mitigate this effect, but it can't batch process images, so that's not an option for now. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/0B3tY27) an example though of a frame ran through Gigapixel, and then Denoiser, and I must admit, I think it came out great.

Overall, I'm super impressed with this tech. I appreciate that CBS might not want to spend millions on remastering DS9/Voyager properly, but as long as there's a standard definition source that doesn't suffer from the same compression artifacts and frame interpolation issues as the DVD source, this would be a great alternative if used correctly.

We have seen time and time again what the federation looked liked in that century yet discovery and now from the look of it the picard series goes for the cliche scfi look. Holographic controls, advance looking computers that can only exist thanks to a CGI budget.

The original series was buttons and dials not hologram’s. Controls that even enterprise kept to and made the look of the show flow into the original series so everything shown would become what was in the original series. 

The next generation, deep space nine and voyager all had the LCARS which was a multi used touch control and screen built into one system. 

I don’t see how technology can go from practical technology that works incredibly well to holographic controls that from the look of it are more of a gimmick than practical for everyday use.

Information on the attack on the enterprise by the bird of prey was given and exaggerated by the klingon captain, stating that the enterprise had ran in fear from his assault. 

Before arriving to the planet, the enterprise was struck by a plasma storm, further damaging the ship's computer causing further corruption of the officer's logs and internal sensor logs.

While approaching the planet, atmospheric complications caused the shuttle to suffer a hard landing, disabling all systems, leading to the vessel being scuttled. While planetside, the away team encountered a hostile plasma based life forms, suffering heavy losses. After rescue, the planet was quarantined in an agreement between all parties involved and all surviving information was classified. The only available information on the event is limited to data recovered from the klingon vessel and lore told by locals on the paradise planet.

The actual events were studied by a cloaked federation time ship and several operatives stationed on the enterprise and bird of prey. The information, including location of the planet, remains labelled ""For Official Use Only"".",startrek,1570479488,thelewis564,11,0,True,2019-10-07

1415,Maps of Space - Canon and Non-Canon,"I've been looking around today a good deal for maps of space that entail proper canon positions of, well, everything. From the territories of major powers, to planet and starbase locations and names. The problem is, I've seen just about a half a dozen different maps, and they all show different information. That's a big issue for me, since I've been working on a pilot script for a new Star Trek series. Because of how the plot goes, I want to be sure I know the canononical locations of everything, rather than just vague ideas or assumptions.

On one map for example, I've seen the Tholian Assembly being placed as a small territory below the Klingon Empire and bordering the Gorn, and the Breen having a small territory near the Ferengi Alliance. Then there's other maps instead showing the Tholians past Cardassian space with a vast territory, and the Breen more closely bordering the Cardassian Union, which makes more sense based on what Deep Space Nine had mentioned before. (In DS9 there are several mentions of the Tholians, including Cassidy Yates mentioning that she had rendezvous to make with Tholian ships. If they were really near the Klingon Empire, that's one heck of a distance to travel.)

My guess is that the latter maps are likely the more accurate ones for lining up better with conclusive evidence based on the series canon. But what I'd like to know is if anyone has come up with a solid analysis of the accuracy of various maps, and can point to a map that's the closest to being both clearly defined and canon?",startrek,1570494456,TheGameAce,4,1,True,2019-10-07

But at the end of the day it's just entertainment and our lives wouldn't be different to any significant way without it.

Star Trek is different. People who grew up on Trek are inspired to become scientists, astronauts, inventors and engineers. It forms our morality and sense of right and wrong. It brings us hope for the future. It shows everyone has the capacity to contribute and lead and it shows that when we cooperate on common mutual goals nothing is beyond our reach.

I loved the way he had to speak about science, logic, the fact that facts aren't a matter of opinions.

But it was TNG that really made me love Star Trek, I wish everyone could see at least one episode of that series. It was like TOS but much more mature, each episode could bring so deep reflexions about the meaning of life, what it means to be human, why are we here out there, exploring ? I loved Data, I think because he is the absolute opposite of Spock, wishing to be more human, to actually feel emotions. Oh boy what a character.

DS9 was refreshing, I liked the fact to watch a more ""modern"" series with a real story from the beginning to the end. Plus every character was awesome in their own way (Sisko especially, and Quark my favourite of all). Also it was very nice to finally see what a civilian life could be like in the Star Trek universe.

But then I watched Voyager. And oh my god this was the best of the best of all I have seen in the Star Trek franchise. It was difficult at first, I only liked one character, the Doctor. Everyone else seemed... meh... But as they were more and more developed, you just can't help it, you have to love each of them. AND Seven of Nine comes in at season four and she becomes truly the best character, all series combined. I think I loved her for the same reason I loved Spock and Data, the questioning she brings about humanity, she and the Doctor were the best duo of all time for that reason. I'll always remember their courses about how to socialize. My only regret with Voyager was the final. &gt;!I would have liked to see one last episode about the rehabilitation of each member of the crew once back on earth.!&lt;

Last month I finally watched Enterprise. It was fine, not the crap everyone told me I would be. It was great to see the early years of Starfleet, the small references they made to link it up to TOS.

1435,CBS has a perfect opportunity to tell more traditional Trek stories in a relatively new setting: now is the time for a Titan show,"While Picard would make most things set after Nemesis a prequel, there’s a good 20 year gap in which one could set a show about the adventures of the *USS Titan*. 

For those who are unaware or perhaps need some more detail, the *Titan* is Riker’s first (and likely only) command in the canon. Taking command shortly after Nemesis, *Titan* is a Luna-class long-range exploratory vessel [looks absolutely baller](https://images.app.goo.gl/firDKTQzgGYKem6U8). Now that we know Riker and Troi remain alive and well (and with a child!) into Picard, we know they must’ve been around to do something in the 20 year gap. 

A few things conspire to make a *Titan* show perfect to bring in Trek fans that have yet to buy into the newer entries in the franchise, while also bringing in new fans:

-	*Titan* is one of the most diverse crews in Starfleet history, with only 15% of the complement being human. Some of those crew are truly alien, with the chief medical officer being a literal dinosaur person. The advent of relatively cheap, extremely effective CGI, combined with either puppetry or makeup (Saru and the new Klingons look fantastic), means Trek can show something genuinely unique to the setting, and tell stories with a variety of characters. 
-	The command crew of the *Titan* is a greatest-hits of the TNG era, interspersed with new faces: Riker as CO, a new human XO, Vale, Tuvok as chief of security, nurse Ogawa returning to the medical staff, Troi as chief counselor and diplomatic officer, etc. Also, the dinosaur person. Plus, a Cardassian bridge crew member. There’s just enough new blood to keep things dynamic, and a chance to revisit old favorites. 
-	*Titan’s* mission is old fashioned Trek: go boldly where no one has gone before. The books have the ship going outside the galaxy (by accident), to uncharted areas of the Beta quadrant, and discovering things the shows never even got near. Combine this exploration with serialized character arcs and you’ve got a winning combination of the best of Discovery and the olden ways. 

Not being privy to CBS corporate’s thoughts, I’d wager that they’ve considered this, and, perhaps it hasn’t gone through for a number of reasons. Having to pay royalties to authors to use characters and designs from the books and the difficulty of getting the old cast back (Frakes seems to be hesitant to return to full-time acting) would probably be big obstacles. 

However, if those could be overcome, and we could get a few seasons of *Titan* running around and engaging in some *Enterprise*-style shenanigans, I think that’s something the entirety of the fan base could fall in love with.

I'm really excited for all the old characters in ""Picard"" coming back, but there's a limit to what you can do because they have to fit organically in the story to some extent, otherwise it just feels like fan service and a really small universe, etc.

Imagine a quick story about O'Brien teaching at the Academy and dealing with a student he has to inspire. Or the Doctor living on Earth and meeting other holograms, or a Ferengi story. Or Beverly, LaForge, Riker, and Troi playing a poker game together and just hanging out. Or something about Wesley even. The possibilities are huge because they don't have to tie into larger stories, and the ask for the actors isn't all that massive. It's like a day or two of filming. And the ""Short Trek"" format is a great one-off unserialized story format - what you make doesn't have to tie into larger plots if you don't want it to, and you won't saturate the audience with a 10 minute story about someone you like. The Harry Mudd story is a really good example, it was just enough for us to like seeing him, and not so much that we got sick of him.

Not for all the Short Treks, just maybe one a year or something.

While ""many years"" could be any number, and we do not know how fast his ship was, the timing will allow Discovery to bump into The Doctor quite easily.

What my main point is about is how amazing Jeri Ryan was in Body and Soul, she absolutely captured the doctor in her performance. Many times in these Freaky Friday, body swap stories the performances are awful and cringy, but Ryan pulled it off amazingly.

1472,Does anyone else dislike the Michael/Spock relationship (and what it does to Spock's development)?,"(Spoilers through season 2 of Discovery.  Sort of long and ranty fyi.)

So I just finished watching season 2 and I really, really dislike what they did with the Michael/Spock relationship.  I feel like by putting so much importance on it the writers have made her even more of a Mary Sue (as in literally the original Mary Sue was partly such because she was unduly beloved by Spock and co.)

My issues with Michael aside though, their last scene together was what really put it over the top for me.  To be clear I'm not at all criticizing the actors - I think they're both talented given the right material, and in an alternate universe I probably would've liked the exchange.  My problem is that I don't think the scene should have happened in the first place.  

First of all, what Spock says to her feels unearned.  He says Michael gives him ""balance"" between his human and Vulcan sides, which which feels ridiculous given a. her own emotional instability, and b. the fact that she was literally unintentionally responsibly for squelching his emotional development for decades.  (When exactly was she showing him how to be both human and Vulcan?  When she called him a weird little half-blood freak?)

My biggest problem, though, is how it feels like they've pushed Spock's character development too far.  Spock's not really supposed to achieve balance until TMP at least.  His inner conflict is a major driving force through all of TOS, and I feel like bringing it up this early sort of contradicts that.  It's lampshaded in his comment that he doesn't know how to continue without Michael, but it feels cheap to assume that he majorly regresses in her absence.

He also expresses his feelings for Michael far too easily.  He even presumably tells her ""I love you"" - though it's  established in The Naked Time that he's never said this even to his mother despite wanting to - am I supposed to believe that his relationship with Michael (which was estranged for much of the time) is more important than his relationship with Amanda?  Or Kirk, or McCoy, or every other character he never says that to? 

Hopefully I'm not being too bitchy.  Basically, I love Spock and his character development, and I hate that Discovery makes it more about Michael than him.  Any thoughts?",startrek,1567056770,StarletWitch,29,3,True,2019-08-29

I get that ""Doctor's Orders"" is probably a homage (or if one would be more critical, a rip-off) of ""One"".

With Trek's recent revival surely it makes sense to introduce a ""classic"" exploration style Trek series that actually pushes the franchise forwards. Whilst Enterprise and Discovery have both had a degree of emphasis on exploration as prequels they are both really just filling in the blanks in the Trek timeline. Discovery season 3 will likely have a heavy focus on exploration but by jumping so far into the future it is going to feel a bit like stand-alone series I expect.

It would be great to see a series that has a feel of ToS/TNG set around the same time as Picard in which the Federation has sent ships to make contact with species in the Gamma Quadrant and focuses on the exploration adventures of one ship and it's crew.

Then there's times where Picard is in his ready room, mostly reading or thinking about something, and he's got a whiskey glass (not his glass tea cups) with dark colored liquid he's sips on. 

I know there is synthetic alcohol but that just a toxin free form of alcohol, would still get you drunk but just without hangovers and liver damage.

It just seems weird that they boast about how vice free humanity is in the 24th century but drinking is still ok? You would think if they didn't allow the original series cast/crue smoke in the show, (something very rare in 60s and kinda crazy since we all know Spock, out side the show, smoked like a chimney) that they wouldn't let any Star Trek series to have any sort of vices.

Outside of the movies and most of the original series I hadn't seen too much of Star Trek, but I've always really liked Captain Picard. With the new Picard show coming out I thought it was finally time to sit down and watch some classic episodes of TNG. Around the same time one of my friends started telling about how he was watching ""The Orville"" and how he thought I would really like it. Naturally as we begin discussing ""The Orville""  I brought up how similar it is to Star Trek. Then he reveals that his only exposure to Star Trek has been the JJ Abrams movies.

WHAT?

If he likes ""The Orville"" there's no reason he shouldn't be watching classic Star Trek! So I started out by getting him to watch ""Wrath of Khan."" He really liked it, so I showed him ""Mirror, Mirror"" from TOS and ""Past Tense"" from DS9. At this point he is definitely intrigued and wants to see more so I tell him to watch ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and send him an episode guide for watching TNG. He starts making his way through the first season of TNG and tells me that while he likes it he wants to watch a really good episode focusing on Picard to understand why people like him so much.  


So, last night, we met up and I showed him ""Tapestry"" from TNG. This morning I got a text from him telling me that he can't stop thinking about the episode we watched and how it had an impact on him.   


All I can say is that this is the first time I have tried to share Star Trek with anyone and the fact that he likes it is making me really happy! I can't wait for him to watch the episodes with the Borg!

Season 1 and 2 weren't  great, but they weren't as bad as I judged them to  be years ago. Seasons 3 and 4 are stellar. Trip and T'pol's relationship had you jumping out of your skin with their chemistry, and they treated it with confusion and complication that relationships have, rather than the shallow way trek had dealt with loves of the week episodes, or the contrived Dax and Worf love story.  I still think as I did at the time that the final episode was a self destruction and disrespect to the entire show and cast. The tng audience never came to DS9, let alone Enterprise, and to let them have the final episode is unconscionable. Killing Trip was a travesty, and they should have given the fans pay off by showing him and T'pol together. They should have given the fans some good memories in light of the cancelation of the series, that, if on today...would have been renewed with those numbers it pulled. I'd like to know your thoughts on the series, so sound off...

1517,Risa Nights - my pilot episode idea.,"I was listening to the hilarious 'Make It So' star trek podcast (on the Simply Syndicated network) where they discuss possible spin-off ideas. My favourite, by far, was the 'Risa Nights' show where Will Riker retires from Starfleet and becomes Magnum PI on Risa. Maybe CBS would be willing to commission this? 

Act 1: USS Titan, under the command of William T Riker who has recently been divorced by Deanna Troi after an argument caused when she crashed a runabout into spacedock. Captain Riker is growing tired of his Starfleet career and complains that being in command of a starship involves far too much bureaucracy and diplomacy for his liking. Declaring shoreleave, he plots the Titan on course towards Risa. 
Entering orbit around the planet, Riker is informed about the sudden death of Mr. Wesley Crusher, apparently killed whilst vacationing on Risa. 

Riker isn’t particularly upset but demands answers from the incompetent Risian security service. He beams down to the surface with an entourage of attractive ensigns and asks around seedy nightclubs for any information about recent killings. Riker learns that the assailant frequents a local gravity altering bar. It is there that Riker uses his beard powers to dispatch the Nausicaan who killed Wesley. It is implied the Nausicaan was sent to kill Wesley to prevent top secret information from being released to Starfleet. Riker ponders this briefly before going out drinking. 

Act 2: Riker wakes up in bed with two, no... three beautiful Orion women and decides to return quickly to the Titan after one of them says they are falling in love with him. He has difficulty establishing communications as the Titan is under heavy attack, and is ultimately destroyed by unidentified alien battleships. The strange ships then block all communications to and from Risa but do not invade, simply hanging in the sky. 

Riker receives a mysterious tip to travel to Suraya Bay where he finds a shadowy figure in robes playing a flute. Moving closer to catch a glimpse of his face, Riker is shocked to find his old boss... Jean Luc Picard. Picard does not speak, he only continues to play the flute. Riker deduces that Picard is communicating to him through music so he fetches his trombone to jam with Picard. Subtitled messages reveal that Picard has been sent by the Federation to watch over Risa as a kind of reward assignment. Picard also knows that the blockade is made up from artificial lifeforms including androids and holograms - tired of flesh and blood rule. 

Picard hints that he may know the leader of this force, and we see a tear in his eye. Picard tells Riker that he must rescue a lady named Carrusa from a criminal gang who manage a glitzy Risian hotel chain. Carrusa, as well as being young and attractive, is a transporter specialist who may be able to find a way to beam Riker to one of the alien ships. 

Act 3: After rescuing Carrusa from the hotel, she takes Riker to her super secret cave laboratory where she is able to refine her transporters to get Riker’s signal through the alien shields and jamming frequencies. He immediately beams up to the largest alien ship and is met with hostile machinery and violent holograms. An epic fight scene ensues. After making it to the command centre, a familiar voice in the darkness ‘welcomes’ Riker and beckons him forward.

The voice is revealed to be his old friend and shipmate, Data. Well, technically this is B-4, but he has Data’s memories and has malfunctioned to rise against humans - raising an artificial army and constructing an attack fleet. Riker cannot convince Data to end his siege of Risa and is incarcerated in the brig. Fortunately, Riker is able to use his musky powers to effortlessly charm the hologram guarding his cell into setting him free and giving him an access card to the communications array. From there, he sends automated instructions to all of the AI ships to self destruct. Data reacts in time to escape to the surface with several hostile machines but the fleet is destroyed and long range communication restored. Riker must reach a shuttle before the capital ship explodes with him inside. 

Act 4: It is chaos in the Risian capital as Data’s invasion force attempts to take control of the population. Riker destroys many of the machines before reaching Data who is hiding in an industrial facility. Riker eventually disables him with an EMP. 

Data is sent back to Starfleet to be ‘patched’ and the Risians begin to recover from the invasion. Riker returns with cocktails to where he met Picard but he only finds a note that reads ‘Be seeing you, Number one….’ Riker then goes to a Risian bar for another well earned drink. Carrusa enters and asks him what his plans are. Riker tells her that he might just stay awhile.",startrek,1567177256,distronaut,1,0,True,2019-08-30

1521,Could Garak not have been exiled at all?,"Don't know if this has been posted before (after all, the show ended 1999, 20 years ago), but... was Garak actually ever exiled? Or was it part of his lies?

Bashir: What I want to know is, out of all the stories you told me which  ones were true and which ones weren't?  
Garak: My dear doctor...they're  all true.  
Bashir: Even the lies?  
Garak: Especially the  lies. 

There's nothing that says he wasn't, but then again the only real source we have for Garak's exile is other Cardasians who are about notoriously unreliable (Basically any episode). He was also a member of the Obsidian Order ([DS9 2x22](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wire_(episode))), who are known for puttying operatives in *deep* cover ([DS9 3x05](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Skin_(episode))). Now maybe he wasn't a member of the Obsidian Order, but he does have a device in his brain to resist torture so either he put it there himself for some strange purpose or he really was a member of the Obsidian Order. In which case why was he on DS9? Maybe in some sort of stay behind mission? He does have experience in deep cover missions, or at least as a gardener ([DS9 4x26](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Link_(episode))).

Maybe Tain had him ""[exiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV9t9Db4nkE)"" to be in a stay behind mission to see what was happening on the station as the Federation took over. Doesn't mean Garak had to like it (how many times has your boss asked you to do something you hated?). And besides, the video I just linked could argue that Garak was in fact his personal... secretary. He made up a series of believable lies peppered in with the truth ([such as the mutual hatred between Dukat and Garak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4XVNOv8gQA)) and stays in [constant practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0ba-A01WWA) (I really just wanted to link that scene). So Garak stays on the station, probably out of loyalty to both Cardassia and Tain (again, pick an episode. I doubt anyone is really questioning Garak's [loyalty to Cardassia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XGKkycX81A) [and pride in his home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oORNagSrlNs)). But if he really was exiled, [then why is he able to order Guls around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0mba5Nf520)?

Then why does he seem to be a guilty turncoat? [He was loyal to Cardassia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZwtxGSyzU) (wait... that's the wrong topic), [not the Dominion and not Dukat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLp_HJl-0nI). Oddly enough I would argue that he is being patriotic when [siding with the federation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ). He wasn't going to side with the Dominion, the all consuming force that subjugated everyone and anyone in their wake ([DS9 2x10](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sanctuary_(episode)#Trivia) in the Trivia and [DS9 4x24](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Quickening_(episode))), and had to ironically take up arms against his own people to save them. This didn't come without a cost ([DS9 7x23](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Afterimage_(episode))\*). And this wouldn't be the first time that the various organizations of the Cardassian Union faced off against each other([DS9 3x09](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Defiant_(episode))): the Order and the Military did not exactly get along. Since Garak was effectively the last member of the Order, he could be carrying out his last set of orders: loyalty to Cardassia.

[Now there is the matter of his journals](https://www.amazon.com/Stitch-Time-Star-Trek-Space-ebook/dp/B000FC0UXU), which I have not read. This isn't exactly cannon, but was made out of the Andrew Robinson's journals on the character to better understand Garak so it can't be totally dismissed. After all, the very actor who portrayed Garak used this technique to create the character. What if Garak, the character ([suddenly I'm getting meta and I'm sorry if that feels like it veered off course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDXgG29tB3U)) did the same thing to create his undercover character? I wouldn't exactly take a Cardassians word at face value, but I would expect an expert liar to practice constantly. So I'm not convinced Garak ever was exiled.

For those of you who made it to the end you might see me as a tin foil hat crazy who [has watched to much Archer](https://archer.fandom.com/wiki/Lo_Scandalo). Maybe I'm missing something, over looking another thing, or just trying to make a [coincidence out to be something it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-E-o0ajGAo).

[Or maybe he's just a really, really good tailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofmTGCvYCag).

1536,Characters we are likely and unlikely to see in the next Picard series.,"I'm sure you are all as mindbogglingly stoked about the new Picard series as I am, especially after the latest trailer.  Here are my picks for the most and least likely characters we all know and love to appear on the show.  Please give your own lists in the comments but please don't hate if you don't agree with my list.  This is my first post in this sub and I'm hoping it's not as aggressive as some others.  So without further adieu...

Most likely:  Quark (Armin Shimerman) - Picard will seemingly be operating outside of Star Fleet which means he will need some outside help.  Quark, while a somewhat disreputable character may be an ideal source of intelligence (for a price).  The actor, Armin Shimerman, is apparently an amazing person who loves to welcome and help his fellow actors.  He also played one of the first Ferengi in TNG.

Least likely: Q (John de Lancie) - I know you're going to hate me for this one, but please read first before you downvote.  John de Lancie MADE Q!  While others, including his own son (both actor and character) have played the role no one has ever measured up.  He is easily one of the most favored recurring characters in the entire Star Trek franchise.  I could go on and on about how amazing he is but I'm sure many others already have.  The problem is that while Q is un-aging, John de Lancie is not.  It would be hard to bring him back without a LOT of makeup and CGI.  I doubt they will but I really am hoping.

Most likely: Garak (Andrew Robinson) - Garak was a puzzle, wrapped in an enigma, with twists and turns.  After 7 seasons of DS9 we still no very little about his character.  There was truth in every lie, but what was true and what was a lie?  The actor apparently loved playing the role, so one might assume he would love playing it again.

Least likely: Captain Sisco (Avery Brooks) - While Captain Sisko had an amazing story ark and a huge amount of character development, DS9 ended on a cliffhanger.  Bringing him back would need no less than a mini-series.  Anything less and fans would go ballistic.  He deserves so much more than a few lines of dialog before bringing him back.  I'd love to see him but anything less would be horrific.  

So, what do you think of my list?  What's yours?",startrek,1567231953,SO2K,25,3,True,2019-08-31
1537,Saru/Kelpiens and anxiety disorders,"So, this is something I was thinking about: Star Trek has historically been a show that uses ""coded"" representation for identity in the form of alien races. This can include ethnic examples, such as the famous fan-letter from a mixed-race fan in the 1960s who was able to identify a lot of his own experiences in Spock. This can also extend to (for lack of a more scientific or correct word) ""neurodiversity"". For example, people on the autism spectrum often relate to Spock, Data, or Barclay for different reasons. I actually think that Kelpiens are a great extension of this theme in that their race has a traumatic history that developed a high evolutionary threat response. With Saru in particular, his threat response sometimes flares up in situations that are easily manageable with technobabble and plot armor.   


  
I know some viewers find this annoying, but not only is it a great indicator for dramatic tension, it also does what Star Trek does best: giving people a character to identify with through metaphor. Saru's threat response, and Kelpiens in general, seem like a pretty relatable concept to people who experience severe anxiety or have similar responses triggered by traumatic treatment they've received in the past.

Chief of security: Odo (shapeshifting would be real handy in so many situations)

1572,Thoughts on Borg origins and the possibilities for the new Picard show,"I know that the issue of the Borg collective's origins has not been addressed in canon, but I recently finished watching the HBO Russell Davies family drama Years and Years and it made me recall my own speculations, as a teenager, about the origins of the Borg. 

We know that the Borg began as a humanoid species in the Delta Quadrant.  We also know that the Borg took a path that no other known humanoid species has taken, namely collective consciousness and the development of universal cybernetic enhancements.  What prompted the Borg to take this path? 

I think that the best answer lies with an analogy to the origins of the Cooperative in the Voyager episode Unity.  In that episode, the neural transmitters that the post-Borg humanoids have in their bodies are used to forcibly reintegrate dissidents into a collective consciousness for the purpose of reestablishing harmony on the planet that they call home after their ship was disabled and they were stranded there.  

In the show Years and Years, the world is continuing on a bleak trajectory from 2019 through the 2030s.  Automation is destroying jobs, conflicts between rival superpowers are threatening nuclear war and climate change, along with all of these other factors, is creating a stream of refugees, populations deemed useless or criminal, and the threat of mass human extinction and the reduction of the human population to a meager, bleak existence.  On the other hand, humans are increasingly able to physically integrate with technology, if they can afford it.  

In Star Trek continuity, humanity made first contact very shortly after suffering through World War III and, over time, learned to use the available technology to create a post-scarcity future.  There was also probably an aversion to the physical alteration of humans as a result of the Eugenics Wars.  

But what if the Borg simply took a different path? What if they were part of a society that elected to pursue forced consciousness integration in order to assure the efficient use of resources and to avoid the conflicts that had dominated their society before neural integration? And they slowly began to promote that same approach as they expanded into the galaxy? 

Additionally, it is possible that this approach is not unique to the humanoid species that created the Borg in the Delta Quadrant, and that the Borg actually represent a synthesis of several approaches to collective consciousness to achieve the same result: A harmony that avoids the self-destructive tendencies of humanoid societies that maintain the more chaotic individuality that we see is the dominant model in Star Trek species.  

It would also raise some interesting questions on Picard, if indeed both the Federation and the Romulans appear to be pursuing Borg technology for some perceived gain.  The Federation has not managed to avoid conflicts or even environmental catastrophes (a la Force of Nature, where it is posited that warp drive itself may present a problem for the well being of the galaxy). It is at least conceivable that Borg technology represents a possible solution to some or all of these problems for various races.

Now I get that TNG had budget issues when it came to building sets but I would have thought that by the time DS9 came along and built the runabout set they could have occasionally partially re-dressed that set as the Enterprise D's ""Calypso"" interior. And when Voyager added the Delta Flyer could they not have written it that they used the hull of Voyager's aeroshuttle. As they were using so much CGI for the external shots by this point they could have easily had it launching from Voyager's saucer section without having to build a working model of it.

I would have assumed that the large stone slab would have fallen into his beam as his physical form began to dissipate, possibly causing the stream to lose some integrity.

1631,On Data's Emotions,"I have always had a bit of an issue with Data's purported lack of emotions as portrayed on TNG.  Obviously his emotions to not rule his existence the way they do for some humans, but he experiences a lot of emotion-adjacent things over the course of the series, including but not limited to:

- Curiosity, a desire to know
- Remorse/regret
- Caring for another person, the ability to have friendships
- A desire for vengeance... sort of (the most toys)
- Apparent sadness (when Picard leaves his recital)

I think Data seems to experience emotions more than the show claims.  The writers seem to struggle with writing any conflict for Data that doesn't involve emotional responses (beyond being unable to laugh, or unable to fall in love, or be offended, or other major ones) and thus kind of gave up on actually following through with that over the course of the show.  Because it is hard to write for a character that is literally emotionless, they instead choose to write an emotional (though somewhat stoic by human standards) character and then periodically remind us that he doesn't actually feel things so that we know his responses aren't *really* emotional.",startrek,1567521993,risemix,9,15,True,2019-09-03

Star Trek: The Next Generation re-runs were on twice a day. It was a good time to be 13 years old and obsessed with Star Trek. In the summer of '96, it was even better to be 13 years old, obsessed with Star Trek and within striking distance of Toronto because ... dun dun dun ... Star Trek: The Exhibit descended on the McLaughlin Planetarium.  
 

 The commercials for Star Trek: The Exhibit played during the TNG re-runs on CityTV, a local network that showed TNG re-runs daily at 7pm in those times. I absolutely had to go.

1639,Was the relationship between Dr. Mora and Odo built to mirror that between an abusive father and emotionally vulnerable son or is this particular of the show intermittently interesting but also awful?,"So at this point imo Mora's a creepshow on par with Kai Winn. I've just finished Begotten and, whoa man.

So just to illustrate how I'm feeling about this the premise of the episode is that !&gt;Quark finds a changeling and 'sells' it to Odo. Odo bonds with it and part of his ethos is that he's going to take it slow; he's going to respect its comfort zone and not torture it for the amusement of a bunch of space Nazis. In other words, he's going to be a good parent. Sisko, genius that he is, recommends Odo bring along his dad to advise. Odo has a similar problem with Mora to Kira with Kai Winn, at least for me - I'm screaming for him to tell Mora to fuckoff back to legoland with his farcical approach to Ethics but for some reason Odo maintains the ear he has for him with delicate care. Not only does he acquiesce and let him in the same room as the child, admittedly out of spite, once Starfleet gets wind of it and demands reports on 'progress,' whatever the fuck that means, Odo, who as we know gives so many fucks about what the Federation likes and wants and has zero sense of personal pride or inclination to self-sacrifice, becomes the thing he hates at Mora's slightest prodding. For god's sake, Mora VERBATIM GOES 'sPaRe ThE rOd, sPoIl tHe ChIlD,' like he's a nun from the 80s. Admittedly he is Bajoran, which explains some of his behavior if it doesn't excuse it.&lt;!

Later on not only does Odo reconcile with dad, he downs bubbly with him. Hurray for giving in to political extortion!

Does anyone have, like, a snippet from the background work that explains the absurdity of this? On the one hand I like this because it really does seem like a plausible portrayal of a toxic dad reentering his estranged son's life clearly against his wishes and exploiting the pressure from his job and stuff to make them partners in crimes against solids. On the other the way the episode is framed it's borderline sympathetic to Mora- as if it's objectively a good thing for a changeling to conform to our understanding of intelligible life. I thought Star Trek was all about understanding, like, alien systems of living and self-actualizing, and learning to work through our differences with them and embracing the majesty of the universe.

1660,My pitch for a Star Trek: Picard that doesn't just seem like Another Streaming Sci Fi Thing.,"I criticized the trailer for feeling like more Discovery or a Disney/Marvelized Star Trek and a friend dared me to come up with an idea that didn't feel like those things, so here is my pitch for a new Star Trek show that only I would like, probably.

First of all, it's called STAR TREK: TRIUMVIRATE. Why? We'll get to that later, but calling it Picard is too on the nose and feels like we're relying on past Star Trek (And we are relying on past Star Trek, we just have to be smoother about it.)

Aight, so TRIUMVIRATE takes place in 2399ish. It's a period of *exceptional calm.* Basically nothing is going on. Klingons are on the verge of a civil war, but they always are so that's nothing new. They probably enjoy being on the verge of a civil war. Romulans have been real quiet for the past, let's say, *fifteen* years. Now, these are Romulans we're talking about and they're always up to some sneaky bullshit so we still have our eyes on them but everything seems pretty chill. The Federation? Well we're just kind of being humans, exploring the universe slowly and steadily. 

We first meet a Starfleet Cadet: Micas Linstrom. She's at Starfleet Academy but not to become a badass fighter pilot or anything - she's studying political science. In fact, she's terrified of space flight, but that's backstory to tackle later. She spends her time both in class and out of it studying the more obscure planets in The Federation, giving her a mostly useless knowledge and skill set.

At the onset of the series, we also meet some Federation brass. These guys, at the top of the Federation hierarchy have mostly become complacent due to the lack of threats in the galaxy. But all that changes when **A MYSTERIOUS ARTIFACT WITH THE POWER TO DESTROY WORLDS IS FOUND ON ZIRKWON IV**

No, just kidding. That doesn't happen.

We see news reports that a planet has voted to leave The Federation. Which planet? It's some bullshit planet like Pulgas II or something. It's a planet with no meaningful resources, no military importance and no real value to The Federation. Who cares about Pulgas II? 

The next day - it's Virion IV, then Cyberion. Planets are announcing their departure from The Federation at a steady pace, but none of these planets actually seem to *matter at all*. This news is met with a collective yawn. The Federation's high ranking officials aren't happy about it, but they couldn't really care less. In fact, some point out that these planets might be doing The Federation a favor by allowing them to expend resources on more ""useful"" planets. 

This news barely registers to anyone with the exception of our Cadet, Micas. She begins digging through records out of sheer curiosity and notices something *weird.* All these planets seem to have experienced a slow, but steady economic boom over the past...*fifteen years(ish)*, despite not having any meaningful increase in natural resources or technological abilities. She presents this information to her professor who immediately takes it to TOP MEN in The Federation. Upon learning this information, they cross-reference it with their own top-secret files and the answer clear: IT WAS THE (goddamn) ROMULANS.

Okay, see - fifteen years ago, the Romulans decided on a drastic change to their conquest tactics. Instead of military trickery, they would try economic trickery. They began a policy of funding pro Romulan politicians on various planets, interfering with elections and occasionally simply paying large sums of cash to dictators to join The Romulan Empire. The payments however, were contingent upon keeping the arrangements secret for a period of time, generally set to be fifteen years. In a later episode, we will learn the fate of one particular planet who attempted to renege on the deal and go public with the arrangement - but that's for later. Fifteen years later (now) and the other shoe has dropped and planets have begun leaving The Federation and joining The Romulan Empire.

This results in a change to how we understand The Neutral Zone. The actual demarcations of The Neutral Zone do not change - this is referred to as the De Jure Neutral Zone. However, because of the Romulan access to planet's deep in Federation territory, a De Facto Neutral Zone also exists. Romulans still do not send military ships into Federation territory, but they do send other ships and equipment, frequently using natural disasters or wars as an excuse to enter their territory. The Romulans are like YoU FeDeRaTiOn GuYs WoUlDnT StOp Us FrOm PrOvIdInG aId WoUlD u????...but actually they're sneaking in all kinds of missiles and cloaking devices, creating forward military bases. These dudes are sooo sneaky.

Anyways, The Federation comes to a conclusion: They gotta expand their reach, and that means changing the process and requirements for joining The Federation. They're going to have open up Federation membership to a wider variety of species and maybe even start thinking outside of the box in regards to what they consider to be intelligent life. And maybe even...The Prime Directive has to be ignored in pursuit of this. MAYBE. We don't know yet. We're gonna see, okay? Wait a few episodes, the issue will probably come up. Anyways, The Romulans' expansion is entirely too aggressive to just passively wait for planets and species to reach out, then put them through a battery of tests, first contact protocols, etc. We have to make these decisions quickly and decisively, the bureaucracy must come to an end! They decide to put the power into the hands of one man, who can be trusted to make these decisions with a level head - but who????????????????????????????

They consult with Micas and her partner (Note: I have not talked about her partner because it's unnecessary background detail - but it is important to know that he is assigned to her by The Federation officials. She's not into it.)  to help make the choice. They begin going through Starfleet records - and this is where you drop all kinds of neat little easter eggs, like you have them look at Barclay's record and it shows him having a bunch of awards for bravery in battle or something, that kind of stuff, hehehe - and they find a bunch of candidates but none of them are quiet perfect. Then they come to Picard. ""Wouldn't he be perfect for the role?"" Of course, but he'd never take the job, especially considering...HOW HE LEFT STARFLEET (Setting up the mystery for later, obviously.)

But they gotta at least ask. So they teleport to France and meet Picard in his vineyard. He's screwing around with his grapes when they arrive, naturally. They ask him if he'll take the job and he declines - why would he want to have that much pressure on his shoulders, single handedly deciding if a planet or a system should be allowed into The Federation? Besides, that's what dictators, like Pol Pot and &lt;Insert some Cardassian here&gt; do, right? BUT, Picard, didn't your success in Starfleet result from your subordinates having to obey you? Here, Picard gives them a tongue lashing about earned power versus given power, etc etc etc. But after thinking it over, Picard says that he will think about it, but that the power can't be his alone. He needs to share the power while still not allowing bureaucracy to weigh the process down. He needs a...**TRIUMVIRATE.**

So what the fuck is Star Trek: Triumvirate? The basic format of each episode is that Picard gets the initial details of a new species, planet or culture that is being considered for inclusion in The Federation. But who is in his Triumvirate? Well that changes each episode. Based on the initial details, he chooses two others to round out the decision making process - this will serve as a great excuse to bring back past characters. For example, in the pretty crappy The Next Generation Episode ""Half a Life"", we meet a species that kills off their people when they turn 60. Now, in Western medicinal cultures, this is an obvious violation of the Hippocratic oath, but is that reason enough to exclude them from The Federation? To help answer this question he might bring in Julian Bashir and The Doctor. They would discuss the philosophical and ethical concerns, with one conveniently being for and the other against the inclusion of the race, probably. Because that's easier to get some quality drama out of. 

The Triumvirate would, throughout the episode get more information to inform their decision. But where is that info coming from? In this show, and in real life, Picard is an old ass man. He's not going to be having crazy space adventures. In fact, as part of his agreement to even do this, he doesn't even have to leave his vinyard if he doesn't want to. The Triumvirate members come to him (Except in rare occasions where we want to shoot in some visually interesting place - perhaps they go to a rainforest when discussing a culture that pollutes with wanton recklessness, damaging the solar system around them.) So he can't get the information himself.

The information gathering is instead handled by THE AWAY TEAM. This is where we fill out the cast with young, hip, hot chicks and hot dudes who wear leather and uppercut and roundhouse kick people off balconies and dive in slow motion while shooting phasers, or whatever. You know what I mean, the people we put on the posters to look cool with lens flares and explosions. I don't really care about that part of Star Trek but ya gotta do it or CBS will cancel you for a spin-off of The Amazing Race. By the end of each episode, using the information gathered by The Away Team and consulting with the other Triumvirate members, Picard would make a decision on if the species would be allowed into the Federation.

Anyways, remember our cadet? She's on The Away Team. Despite her crippling fear of space travel - it's not the space travel that scares her really, it's the infinite blackness, the void. Why? That's episode 4, hold your horses, dude - she is assigned to The Away Team because of her knowledge of obscure planets that others, with their eyes on political appointments and the like have not bothered to study. Oh, also on The Away Team? VASH. That's right, Vash is gonna be Cadet Micas' badass space mommy who will guide her through her exploration of the universe using the knowledge she picked up from her time with Q. Oh, also on The Away Team? The partner assigned to her by The Federation - could he have ULTERIOR MOTIVES??? Also a fucking android dude. Androids in Star Trek rule, so there will be an android. And I guess an alien guy. Gimme a Benzite. Those guys are funny.

1672,A couple thoughts and critiques on the best episode of Star Trek...,"Take Me out to the Holosuite.

 Okay, I'll concede that it might not be the best, but it's definitely my favorite. 

Thought one: That National Anthem was fucking dope and I'm kind of upset that we never hear it again. I'm assuming it was supposed to be the Federation's anthem, so I really think it could have been worked in elsewhere.

Thought two: Bashir should have been the pitcher. He's genetically enhanced and can play darts like nobodies business. Sisko even states that both he and Worf are as strong as a Vulcan. He should be evenly matched with them and at the very least be getting on base, if not knocking them out. 

Thought three: An all-Vulcan crew seems strange, out of place, and kind of against Federation ideals. Like, wouldn't that raise some red-flags in the Admiralty? A captain who wrote several papers while at the Academy about how Vulcans are better than humans starts assembling an all-Vulcan crew? Oh, this dudes a racist..probably shouldn't be a captain.

1673,Star Trek Beyond’s greatest failing wasn’t its own fault. It never used its greatest promotional weapon.,"I love Star Trek Beyond. It’s the best of the nu-Trek movies (which for the record have a much better average than the prime timeline movies). I think it’s genuinely one of Trek’s best, and very much in-line with franchise values.

But I can not and will not ever forgive the studio for fucking up Beyond’s promotion so totally and completely. 

First you have them giving away the ending in the third trailer. Then you have them basically not promoting it at all, despite the 50th anniversary.

And lastly, thought I admit this is very personal because she is my absolute favorite music act ever, I absolutely loathe how Star Trek wastes Rihanna. In Summer 2016, Robyn Rihanna Fenty was no worse than the third biggest pop star on the planet (and likely 2nd). She has crossover appeal like NO ONE ELSE EVER ASSOCIATED with Star Trek (more than Iman, more than Sir Patrick, more than H Jon Benjamin, Jeri Ryan, anyone). She dutifully donned a TOS shirt and spoke on camera (!!!) about watching the show with her father and what it meant to her.

Sure, it’s totally fair to point out she likely isn’t a Trekker/ie, but I don’t need her to be able to pilot the ship out of space dock or that the lattice reconfiguration of dilithium crystals was supposed to introduced in the next class starship. But she still wore the shirt(s), sang the song and spoke about Trek.

That ‘Sledgehammer’ video is gorgeous and she LOOKS THE ENTERPRISE IN THE FACE. Fun fact! She wore a DS9 shirt out in LA during the release. But there was zero effort made by Paramount to leverage anything she did. It’s absolutely shameful, and further evidence that Paramount/CBS/Viacom have zero idea how to actually leverage Star Trek and grow the fan base.

1674,Star Trek: Voyager is so frustrating! (all the series are)(spoilers),"I'm re-watching Voyager, and am midway through season 4. I want to cry or scream at the showrunners. I cannot get over how glorious this show and entire franchise could have been if it was written today (I'm 32, I'm not ""new"" to it). 

I don't mean ""moodier""... but perhaps more realistic, and certainly - show the consequences! Show the effects of experiences and traumas. I understand television was done differently in the past, AND Star Trek has always been a bit ""simple"" - loosely tackling social issues each series... but it's frustrating and almost universe breaking to have the characters seemingly forget the past. 

  
Random examples for anyone interested in reading/debating:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The crew gets stranded by the Kazon. Not only do the crew seem barely phased, but that shit would traumatize and break so many people. They're already stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and their one hope is ripped from them by a double spy (Seska). The reactions from every cast member were ""meh"" (of course I blame the writing). Also, the Kazon basically vanish after S03E01 (**Basics Part II**). I think they're referenced once afterwards. 
2. Torture. So many crew members have some heinous shit happen to them, and RARELY is it ever addressed again. Consider B'Elanna. She has her DNA split by the Vidiians, is tortured... and only brings it up again once they meet another Vidiian later on. Oh, also the Doctor basically drugs her in an episode (**Darkling)**. They laugh it off. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME! Torres has to deal with that crazy hologram who kills his crew (**Revulsion**) . She ALSO has to deal with the crazy ""programs"" in **The Thaw**. You're telling me that doesn't take a toll?
3. Tom gets sucked into the fold between space and subspace. We get one comment on this historical event. No creative description, and never mentioned again. - not to mention the million times he saves the ship. This mofo has saved the entire crew or at least tried to about 5 times by season 4.5. How come he's not walking around with a golden halo?
4. Background actors/replacing crew. Every time a main character has to take their station, they simply bump the person out of the way. No thanks, no nod, there's no interaction - the background characters are empty - and it makes the ship, universe, and show feel empty. *I did notice eventually the showrunners start re-using some of the same people across a season, which is nice. (And I know the Maquis trainees somewhat return in later seasons, i.e. Chell, after the game* ***Elite Force*** *was released).*
5. Q! The Q Continuum.... holy hell. Janeway helps end a civil war, and partially save the UNIVERSE - and she meekly asks ""Hey Q, send us home?"" They can do it. Q introduced the Borg to the Federation, and it has had lasting repercussions in the Trek Universe. He can't send a single ship back home? And Janeway mentions it. Barely. Sorry... but re-watching the first episode, the act of stranding Voyager is weak at best. At this point, after all the crap they've been though - take 45 minutes and explain to us in a heated debate among the crew why Q can't or shouldn't. That should be brought up at EVERY staff meeting. 
6. **Investigations** \- Paris treats Chakotay like shit for several episodes. Janeway and Tuvok lie to him. And when they reveal why - it's a weak reason, AND he gets a line or two of minor outrage over the deception - and then they move on and never address it. Also, I should note that fucking NEELIX ruined the entire plan, accidentally deals with the traitor - completely overriding all the effort and espionage and plan put together to get Paris on a Kazon ship. .... never addressed again.
7. Remember above when the Voyager crew got stranded in the Delta Quadrant? Remember when the Kazon marooned them? Well it happens AGAIN in **Displaced**, with the crew being ""trans-relocated."" There should be crew crying in corners, shuddering from the trauma. Instead, they lounge around like it's the holodeck.
8. KES! **Before and After/Year of Hell.** If she remembers the bogus ass future shown in the episode - fuck the Prime Directive, she's not Starfleet. She should provide Voyager with every goddamn detail and expectation. Never addressed again. She lived the future. Doesn't come up again.
9. Chakotay gets stranded on at least THREE FUCKING PLANETS aside from what I just mentioned (once with Janeway, the former Borg, some civil war). Wouldn't this take a toll, or at least tire someone out?
10. **DEADLOCK.** Harry Kim. and Voyager itself. I'm sure most of us love Battlestar Galactica. What they did right was show the damage to the ship. The amount of shit Voyager goes through - it should be a husk. ESPECIALLY after Deadlock when literal bulkheads are collapsing, and every piece of the ship is blasted apart... and then there's Harry Kim. So far they've never brought it up again that he's from an adjacent reality/universe.  


You get the idea. Thanks for reading. At least the Paris and Torres relationship is consistent and helps anchor me. #shipping

1682,"What do you think of my strategy for getting through the series in an efficient, quality-focused manner?","Here's the rub:  I have deep respect for the legacy of Star Trek, having watched TNG, DS9, and Voyager with mild attention when my father watched them during my childhood, and I want to experience the series myself as a whole now that I'm grown up.  The catch is, this is a dated style of television - not infrequently the ""monster a week"" approach of quantity over quality, and much of the material (particularly the older stuff) strikes me as honestly plodding, of middling quality, and likely to detract from my overall enjoyment if I tried to watch every.  single. episode.

So here's a strategy I've developed:  I'll only watch episodes rated as above average.  I can use [this website](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv_shows/star_trek-28350/), which plots the IMDB ratings of each episode of a TV series, to see which episodes in each season rank above and below the overall average for that season.  Using this methods, I can avoid everything below average in a given run.

What do you think?  Will I miss any really important classic episodes in TOS or TNG using these method?  Will I have to abandon it during DS9 due to the more serialized nature of the plot?  I've seen some lists online of ""essential"" episodes but they rarely seemed complete or consistent with one another.

Then we get to Voyager that is taking place in the same time period and regular EMH completely blows Data out of the water. Even Doctor from early seasons is much more advanced than Data. Data doesn't get sarcasm or figures of speech, Doctor is nothing but sarcasm. Data doesn't understand jokes, Doctor can tell them. Data doesn't feel without his emotion chip upgrade, EMH can love. It seems like the only thing that was holding EMH back is the amount of data it can accumulate. As soon as Doctor started to work as a full time crew member and accumulate data without purging it, it quicly became more human than human. If someone picks an episode of Voyager without knowing anything about the show, they would think that Doctor is just another crew member. Data on the other hand would standout as not being human just by the way he behaves and speaks (and not his skin and eyes color).

1701,"New fan, love TOS but disappointed with the TNG start","I know it's supposed to get better after the second season but I needed to tell someone how disappointed I am.  I just finished watching TOS on Netflix and I was blown away by how amazing some episodes have been.

Now I watched the first two episodes of TNG (I will get to the movies too at some point) and my oh my is it a different beast.

First of all, the pilot is a long jumbled mess made of character exposition and a flimsy plot randomly enforced by the Q, who not only has no reason to be there but is so reminiscent of Trelane that it feels like a ripoff. I am usually forgiving of pilots, but comparing it back to it's equivalent(s) The Cage and Where No Mas Has Gone before, I cannot leave it off the hook.

Then the second episode is a rehashing of The Naked Time and they even admit that in the episode! This was annoying and seems like the show is just trying to replicate the original, and badly at that. Also, I freaking hate Wesley Crusher and everything it represents and I literally rolled my eyes when he taught the ACTUAL engineer how to do her job amd saved the day, it was cringe worthy.

Also, although this is a minor complaint, the bridge of the new Enterprise feels too comfortable and luxurios. I was kind of in love with the submarine like feel of the original bridge. 

I know, I know, that I am complaining about something that aired before I was even born, and that TNG is beloved by millions and I am sure for good reason. It's just that as a newcomer to the show, who was instantly taken by TOS's ability to get across interesting concepts and with excellent story telling, the jump into TNG was a cold shower. Sorry for writing such a paragraph and kudos if you got here.

1706,a bit of a Star Trek story I'm working on.,"So I have an idea for a story that takes place in the Star Trek universe. It doesn't involve any of the characters we've seen before and takes place about 35 years after the end of DS9 for time line reference. So as far as Trek goes, it's basically completely divorced from the main cannon. I had a bit of a creative bug bit today and typed up about a page or so of a scene that would likely be the first page of the story and serves as the start of the framing device for the story itself. Sadly that creative bug bit has worn off and I'm kind of slumped into ""Meh... I'll come back to it later."" So I figured I'd toss it up and see what sort of response I get to the tiny bit I do have.

 Captain  Jinjing Ramirez rubbed her temples in frustration. Leaning forward she brought her elbows to rest on her desk and look at the report. Her chief engineer, Lieutenant Commander Abioye Jamison, had delivered the report half an hour earlier. She had read it, momentarily entertained the possibility that Abioye had made a mistake with the tests, and then dismissed the idea. Abioye didn’t make those kinds of mistakes. He may try to dance like he has three left feet, but when it came to scientific analysis Abioye would have re-confirmed the test results himself after re-confirming the validity of the test itself. There was just no doubt. The isolinear chips, which weren’t scheduled to be manufactured for another 5 years yet, were in fact over 6,000 years old.

She tapped the fingers of her right hand on her desk in a lose 2 beat rhythm while resting her chin on her left hand. It was an unconscious habit she performed when she was puzzling through something. She sat at her desk for a long moment, fingers tapping out the beat in otherwise complete silence. Finally, she exhaled a deep breath.

“*Computer, begin captain’s log*.” She called out. 

“*Captains log, Stardate 82094.4. Back at the academy, Admiral Ty’lan was teaching Temporal ethics. I find myself wishing I could talk to him about this situation. Perhaps laying out the information will help me determine what I need to do.*” She began before taking a breath.

“*A week ago, we were approached by an unidentified ship. It took no threatening actions, and before we could initiate universal hailing, they hailed us. By name and in English. They knew the Mitchell was a Federation starship, and that I was the captain. The people of the ship then identified themselves has having come from a planet in a nei*ghboring system.” She quickly picked up a padd and tapped a series of commands to pull up some information.

“*According to records, the system sports 2 M-class planets with one of them supporting a humanoid race. 75 years ago, it looked like they were advancing toward warp travel and there was recommendation to consider initiating first contact within the decade. There is a follow up report stating that they had appeared to stop their progress toward Warp travel and so the recommendation had been withdrawn. There is no indication as to why they stopped, simply that they did.*” She slid the padd from her hand onto the desk.

“*I suppose that will be one more mystery to add to the list. The identified themselves as Grecarians and presented an ambassador named Da’Ruul that they said would help to ‘answer questions’. But what he provided; well it raises a great many questions.*” She picked up one of the isolinear chips from her desk and examined it.

Ambassador Da’Ruul had handed the series of 12 circuit chip over during our initial meeting, explaining that they were almost 6,000 years old. Jamison had confirmed that. The production codes on the chips themselves match Star Fleet format, but the specific codes on them were in recycling and were intended to be utilized for chips that had yet to be produced. According to Star Fleet engineering, chips with these production codes would be made in about 5 years. 

Ramirez explained all of this to the recording computer. According to what Ambassador Da’Ruul had explained, the chips had been preserved for the last six millennia. When Ramirez had asked the Ambassador how his people had gotten the chips, he said that Ramirez should view the records on them. 

Those records had turned out to be Star Fleet captains’ logs. Captains Logs of the USS Edward Mitchell. A Nova II class ship that was intended to be launched in 6 years. And, according to the logs on the chips, was to be captained by her current helm officer, Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan. 

Ramirez couldn’t stop herself from grinning as she mentioned Hodoyan being the captain of the Edward Mitchell. He was a capable officer and showed a lot of promise. His Benzite meticulousness allowed him to handle and mentally catalog a great many details about various situations while his eidetic memory allowed him to recall all those details with an almost computer like efficiency. She figured he would make a good first officer in the next year or so and be ready for command in about five.

There are highs (The Search two-parter!), there are many mids (most episodes) and then there are some lows. Overall, the world feels lived in and complex and cozy and with so many episodes behind me hte mere accumulation has done its work and I'm comfortable being around these characters -- although it can be a bit too ""a day in the life""/soap opera in many cases -- certainly it's a completely different format from TNG, where the self-contained ""SF adventure of the week"" made things more exciting, and TNG's highs were higher than DS9's if I may say (at least for now)...

Well, Meridian: I had many issues with this episode. And I expect to get downvoted.

“I was admiring…your markings…If you don’t mind me asking…how far down do they go?” “All the way.”

In the main story, the *Defiant* discovers a planet which phases in and out of ‘our plane of existence’ every 60 years, and Dax very quickly falls in love with one of its inhabitants and decides to leave everything — everything! — behind and join him in that parallel existence. It’s sudden, I don’t know if it’s the acting or the writing or both but the melodrama is not very believable, and it’s full of technobabble that make you feel how much this is more fantasy than science. Dax is often defined by her being a beautiful woman more than anything else, and it’s the case in this episode as well. I feel Dax's stories have potential but are not well-exploited.

In the second story, an alien is sexually infatuated with Kira and orders Quark to make him a holosuite program with a virtual recreation of Kira, for his own sexual reasons, so Quark has to stalk Kira in order to capture her likeness. Again, a story that by today’s standards would be categorized as completely sexist (or at least it would be acknowledged in the dialogue that these are sexual predators and it’s not for laughs).",startrek,1567781838,orodromeus,18,6,True,2019-09-06

 Captain Jinjing Ramirez rubbed her temples in frustration. Leaning forward she brought her elbows to rest on her desk and looked at the report. Her chief engineer, Lieutenant Commander Abioye Jamison, had delivered it half an hour earlier. She had read it, momentarily entertained the possibility that Abioye had made a mistake with the tests, and then dismissed the idea. Abioye didn’t make those kinds of mistakes. He may try to dance like he has three left feet, but when it came to scientific analysis Abioye would have re-confirmed the test results himself after re-confirming the validity of the test itself. There was just no doubt. The isolinear chips, which weren’t scheduled to be manufactured for another 5 years, were in fact over 6,000 years old.

She tapped the fingers of her right hand on her desk in a lose 2 beat rhythm while resting her chin on her left hand. It was an unconscious habit she had when she was puzzling through something. She sat at her desk for a long moment, fingers tapping out the beat in otherwise complete silence. Finally, she exhaled a deep breath.

“Computer, begin captain’s log.” She called out. 

“Captains log, Stardate 82094.4. Back at the academy, Admiral Ty’lan was teaching Temporal ethics. I find myself wishing I could talk to him about this situation. Perhaps laying out the information will help me determine what I need to do.” She took a breath before continuing.

“A week ago, we were approached by an unidentified ship. It took no threatening actions, and before we could initiate universal hailing, they hailed us, by name and in English. They knew the Venture was a Federation starship, and that I was the captain. The people of the ship then identified themselves as having come from a planet in a neighboring system.” She quickly picked up a PADD and tapped a series of commands to pull up some information.

“According to records, the system sports 2 M-class planets with one supporting a humanoid race. 75 years ago, it looked like they were advancing toward warp travel and there was recommendation to consider initiating first contact within the decade. There is a follow up report stating that they had appeared to stop their progress toward Warp travel and so the recommendation had been withdrawn. There is no indication as to why they stopped, simply that they did.” She slid the PADD from her hand onto the desk.

“So, one year they were on the cusp of achieving warp travel, and then they just stopped advancing in that direction. No indication as to what caused them to stop. Typically, such a change in development would be preceded by some sort of major disaster or social upheaval. But the Federation observation teams saw no evidence of such things. What made them stop work on Warp Travel when they did? I suppose that will be one more mystery to add to the list. Obviously sometime in the last 60 years they resumed work on warp travel and developed the technology enough to have interstellar ships.” Ramirez laid out her thoughts as she spoke the words. 

“The people from the ship identified themselves as Grecarians and presented an ambassador named Da’Ruul that they said would help to ‘answer questions’. But what he provided; well it raises a great many questions.” She picked up one of the isolinear chips from her desk and examined it.

Ambassador Da’Ruul had handed the series of 12 circuit chips over during our initial meeting, explaining that they were almost 6,000 years old. Jamison had confirmed that. The production codes on the chips themselves match Star Fleet format, but the specific codes on them were in recycling and were intended to be utilized for chips that had yet to be produced. According to Star Fleet engineering, chips with these production codes would be made in about 5 years. 

Ramirez explained all of this to the recording computer. According to what Ambassador Da’Ruul had explained, the chips had been preserved for the last six millennia. When Ramirez had asked the Ambassador how his people had gotten the chips, he said that Ramirez should view the records on them. 

Those records had turned out to be Star Fleet captains’ logs. Captains Logs of the USS Edward Mitchell. A Nova II class ship that was intended to be launched in 6 years. And, according to the logs on the chips, was to be captained by her current helm officer, Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan. 

Ramirez couldn’t stop herself from grinning as she mentioned Hodoyan being the captain of the Edward Mitchell. He was a capable officer and showed a lot of promise. His Benzite meticulousness allowed him to handle and mentally catalog a great many details about various situations while his eidetic memory allowed him to recall all those details with an almost computer like efficiency. She believed he would make a good first officer in the next year or so and be ready for command in about five. If the records were real, her estimation of his career path was accurate.

She picked up one of the translucent yellow chips and moved it between her fingers while she rolled the information around in her mind in some vein hope of coming upon an epiphany. All evidence pointed to a Star Fleet crew, led by Hoyodan, having major involvement with a developing society, even introducing new technologies. A major violation of the prime directive, and since time travel was apparently involved, likely a major violation of the temporal prime directive as well. The Grecarians wouldn’t have the isolinear chips otherwise. Even if the ship had crashed and the remains recovered, the materials used in the chips would have decayed and broken-down centuries ago. These chips had to be specifically preserved, which meant the people who preserved considered them to be important.

Ambassador Da’Rull had explained that at the time, many of the different tribes on his world’s northern continent was just entering the equivalent of the Iron age. An iron age society would have the technology to preserve something like the chips, but in most other cases that Ramirez knew of such efforts tended to be used for religious reasons, like the preservation of the remains of a God-king or similar. 

“Could they have believed that the chips were ‘gifts from the gods’ and were worth preserving?” she asked off handedly.

“There are insufficient parameters provided for that query. Please restate.” Ramirez jumped at the computer’s voice responding to her unintended question.

“Computer disregard.” She said as she slid the isolinear chip out of her hand and onto the surface of her desk. She rested her chin on her left hand for a long moment before she came to a decision. 

“Computer, pause captain’s log.” She commanded. The computer chimed in response halting the recording. 

“Let’s see what these logs actually say.” She said as she shorted the chips by production code and selected the one with the highest number on it. Typically, the higher the production number, the later the chip was inserted into the computer core and the newer the files on it. She hoped this also meant that this meant the logs on this chip talked about the events in the other chips. She slid the chip into the reader on her terminal. The screen blinked on and quickly listed the files on the chip. The logs were listed by stardate, stardates that were displaced by 6,000 years anyway. All except for the last file. It was listed with her name. 

In a moment of surprise, she sighed. Tapping a series of keys, she selected the file and had her terminal load the log. 

The screen flickered and finally filled with the image of Hodoyan. An aged, and much worse for wear version of Hodoyan it had to be noted. On the screen his skin was a dull grey brown with patches of red, whereas the officer that was presently in command of the ship had shiny blue skin with a few areas of brown at the edge of his upper lip and around the pronounced brows. The image of Hodoyan on the screen was missing his right eye, the organ apparently having been gouged out several years prior as evidenced by the dark brown scar tissue that ran from where the tendril would have been on that cheek, up through the socket and splitting the right brow. Whatever had taken his eye had apparently also taken the tendril on that side of his face. There were other smaller scars visible, while his remaining eye was quite sunken in its socket. The tendril coming from his left cheek was significantly longer then what Hodoyan had at present... well ‘present’ being the Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan that was currently sitting on the bridge. Ramirez wasn’t an expert on Benzite aging, but if she had to guess the Hodoyan displayed on the screen was around 80 years old, about 50 years older than he presently was. Quite old for a Benzite. 

Ramirez found herself not believing that the person on screen was the same person she was presently serving with. The Benzite on screen was battle worn and imagining a Benzite being involved in a war was itself difficult even more so for Hodoyan as he was a diplomate at heart. 

“Hello Jingjin. If my calculations are correct, you should be seeing this message just about a week after meeting the ambassadors of this world.” The older Hodoyan spoke. 

“That explains how they knew my name and the name of the ship.” Ramirez thought. 

“If my memory serves me still, I imagine you have a great many questions about this.” the recording spoke in long, deliberate syllables. Hodoyan took a long breath, the act producing a wet hissing sound. 

“Yes, these records have been deliberately preserved so that I may be judged for my actions. I confess that I am very curious how the judge advocate general’s office will even attempt to address my actions given the time. Can the Federation even judge actions from six thousand years ago?” Hodoyan chuckled slowly before coughing.",startrek,1567837539,TorroesPrime,0,1,True,2019-09-07

So i think it would be really cool if the Queens are whats left of the first species. Here what i think happened (or at least it would be awesome)

The Borg were a subspace civilisation and at some point they created a way to be always connected so that they became more effective while retaining some of their personality, at one point they Found another civilisation and they wanted to share this technology, (or they just conquered them but i personally like a Idea of a peacefull species).
 But what they did not think was that the personality of the other species would just merge with the Borg and almost instantly the Borg had all the technology and personality of the other species. Wishing for every species to expérience the technology and link of the Borg they made their mission to Search for other species to assimilate into the Borg.
At that point the original species of the Borg were a fraction of the total population and since they still had some individuality or indépendance from the Borg collective they naturally became the Queen of the hive like a bee Queen influencing the drone in important décision but letting the collective decode on more trivial décision

That would be awesome i think and would give a reason as to why they Conquer everything

It is kinda of nice to know that not all of the *TNG* sets were trashed in the making of *Generations*. That lounge set feels rather special in a way, perhaps because of how it transcended TV shows and the films, making it's big screen debut as the dining hall in *Star Trek VI, The Undiscovered Country* (where it *did* get sort of trashed, but returned to it's true form not long after.)

It's also nice that it was actually restored to it's TNG glory in the final episode of *Enterprise*, where they had recreated some part of the Enterprise D.

It's still what I'm going to work with with an AU fanfiction I'm working on.

Okay, how much the kick in the gonads delivered to them by Future!Janeway in Endgame actually inconveniences the Collective is something that's often lead to heated debates, and I'm aware that I might start another one, but I'm one of those who thinks that the Borg Collective is cripled for the relative long-term.

My way of approaching these things is ass-backwards, but bear with me. This is also me massively nerding out about Star Trek. :)


*-There is more than one Borg Queen and destroying one didn't really criple the Borg after First Contact.*

True, I actually agree. Even if Memory Aplha didn't state that there were multiple Queens, it would be criminally negligent for a thing like the Borg who prizes redundancy and distributed computing (for lack of a better word) like they do to risk the survival of the whole like that. Did it hinder them? Slow them down? In First Contact's context? No, probably not all that much, but we have no information to know for sure. In my opinion the Borg wouldn't risk even one of several Queens on the frontlines against a species who has managed to be very good at resisting in the past. Nor would they risk another trojan horse attack like what happened with Locutus, so they probably had a spare Queen ready and activated her when contact with the Cube was lost.

You also have to keep in mind please that the Borg episodes of Voyager took place around the time of First Contact, i.e. in 2373, (which is probably the reason why only one cube was sent to Earth instead of a dozen, as the Borg were a mite busy with Species 8472 at the time), and Voyager encountered the 2nd Borg Queen in 2375, so there definitely was some sort of contingency in place.


*-The virus thingamagic Future!Janeway used couldn't infect the entire collective, it didn't have time/the incident was too isolated.*

Here I actually mostly disagree. In Endgame, the Borg Queen gave no indication that she'd lost contact to the collective until she was infected by the virus, so with what little information we have, we have to assume that she controlled everything even then. Frankly, it feeds into my response to the redundancy thing. There is no way the Borg Queen would be nuts enough to knowingly go anywhere where she's cut off from the hive. Given how she reacted to prior attempts to sever parts of the collective, it's save to say risking it that way wouldn't be in her nature.

Now did the virus infect everything and kill every single drone? No, probably not. If it proliferated itself across the Borg Network in anything like an IRL computer virus did (minus depending on idiots opening random e-mail attachments or skeevy porn sites of course) then it would still take time even with Borg communications factored in. We know that Borg ships or small groups of Drones can form their own mini-collective, of course there's probably a large chunk of the Collective who did this as the rest of the hive started going off-line. 

And then there's always random chance.

TLDR being that I think that the Virus could have infected the entire collective but probably didn't both because of random chance and things in the real world just not working out that perfectly.

These are of course only the two most common arguments I have encountered.

So what happened with the Borg?

I think that between everything, the virus and the destruction of the transwarp network the collective was dealt a not quite mortal blow. They lost a huge number of ships and drones because of the events of Endgame, and I think that the losses they took will take them a century or two to make good, if not more.

In the end, I think the thing that really crippled them was the Transwarp getting kablooeyed by Voyager. Yeah, the first Cube attacking the Federation in BOBW didn't use the apeture that close to Earth and nor did the one in First Contact, but they did use others to get close to Federation space. We know that the Borg have transwarp tech that doesn't rely on the network, but  we don't really know how long it took Voyager to traverse those 20k light years. Once again I'm applying some logic to this by saying that if the Transwarp tech as fitted to Borg ships were a faster and more efficient way to move ships across the entire galaxy, then the Borg wouldn't be using the Network. 

Think of the transwarp coils as technology for tactical movement whereas the network was strategic. With it, you could  dump entire fleets in spitting distance from Earth, yes. But from there you'd still need warp drive to attack Vulcan or the rest of the Federation core worlds.

So the Collective's ability to coordinate among itself, communicated in large groups and then quickly move said troops through the Galaxy without giving anyone any forewarning is gone, and to an extent won't be coming back anytime soon.
Borg are still dangerous and probably will be until the end of time, but I think that we likely shouldn't be seeing any sort of coordinated attack on the Alpha Quadrant powers any time soon. At least for the remainder of the 24th and all of the 25th Century. If ever. Ideally, all that's left is single or small groups of Borg ships randomly roaming about the Delta Quadrant.

And even if they come back one day, we're talking about a faction that, even in the non-memetic, non TV form, managed to develop Borg buster torpedoes within less than a lifetime. By the time they are in any shape to look outward again and move beyond their tech stagnation, the Federation will be an entirely different beast for them to fight.",startrek,1567885311,trekchu,2,1,True,2019-09-07
1756,Tonight I discovered Arena; a low-budget sci-fi featuring Marc Alaimo (Dukat) as the villain and Armin Shimerman (Quark) as his right-hand man.,"I'm not sure why I decided to click on this while browsing Netflix but I'm glad. It's essentially Bloodsport in spaaaaaace, and while it's hardly the best film I've ever seen it's very watchable. The outer space special effects are absolutely *awful* but it features some surprisingly decent creature designs, makeup and costumes (with a few exceptions).

Of course the real attraction for a Trekkie is seeing the glorious duo of Marc and Armin acting together years before DS9. Marc plays an alien underworld boss whose character and performance isn't a million miles removed from Dukat, albeit with some atrocious makeup and a silly costume (it's essentially Marc painted silver, sporting a naff haircut and wearing a suit that makes him look like a futuristic butler). As the title says, Armin plays his right-hand man, er, alien who looks a bit like a rat with suitably Ferengi-esque sharp teeth. The makeup is far better than what poor Marc has to put up with, and even though it covers his entire head you can still instantly recognise Armin even before he speaks. 

So yeah, if you're curious to see Quark and Dukat: The Early Years and are in the mood for a cheesy 80's sci-fi then this is your film!

1766,Walter Mosley Circumstances of departure from DISCO shows how incapable the writing staff are,"So after reading up on the circumstances of Mosleys departure from DISCOs writing staff I was so Pissed as I usually am with the writing of DISCO so pissed that I decided to make my first post ever on Reddit about it. 

For all who don't know Walter Mosley he is a Jewish African-American who is most known for writing crime novels and was also one of the writers for DISCO.

Walter Mosley was essentially forced to resign recently because he told a story where he was pulled over by the police where the police officer explained that ""he stopped all n—-rs in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in n—-r neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good,""

""I just told a story about a cop who explained to me, on the streets of Los Angeles, that he stopped all n—-rs in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in n—-r neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good,""  
- Direct quote from Walter Mosley from the New York Times

After retelling this story (which which is don't get me wrong is appalling which continues to show how broken American the American judicial system is) another member of the writing staff made an offial complaint against him saying ""it made them feel uncomfortable"".

And ladies and gentlemen is part of the problem with the writing of DISCO and everybody or almost everybody on the writing team. They are unfortunately to PC to much in need of there safe space to afraid to talk about real issues and I understand that safe safes can be a useful thing but when it come to writing a show about hard issues like racism and sexism and injustice your safe space and fear of a tiny little 6 letter world has no place there as it ruins what makes trek so good when you can't face the harsh issues and write about them in an effort to help solve them.

Think about what ""Past tense"" would be without the ability to face the gap between wealthy and poor or what ""Rejoined"" would be like without the ability to look at same sex relationships or ""Far beyond the stars"" without Siskos struggle with being a black man in 1950s New York. (Can you tell my favourite star trek is DS9).

Those episodes simply don't work without the ability to examine those issues and star trek would not be known for its previous ability and willingness to deal with these issues if all the ""Golden Age"" trek writers were made uncomfortable to the point of making an official complaint whenever they heard about a word that made them feel uncomfortable. Star Trek would not be one of the best if not the best piece of science fiction ever made if it did not used to have this such incredible ability to cover these harsh issues and relate them to us to make us examine ourselves and how we interact with people.

How are the writers of DISCO meant to tackle these real issues if they themselves are unable to tackle these issues in their own heads.

I finished my first watch through of this episode last night and thought it was quite good. After, I did some reading through some old posts here and found that some people had a lot of issues with it, so I watched it a second time today and I still think it manages to hold up.

I suppose I just want to start a general discussion on the episode. What did you like or dislike? What held the episode back and what could have made it better?

Personally, I loved it. I thought the episode was exciting and did a good job of telling the story of Red Squad. I didn't feel like this episode took place on the Valiant with Red Squad just because, I felt as though the reasoning for the episode was solid and made sense.

1779,My first TOS complete watchthrough,"I grew up with TNG and later series, but for whatever reason I had never watched all the way through TOS. I had seen individual episodes on TV or VHS at various times. I wanted to share my thoughts:

It took me a year or so on and off. For whatever reason TOS isn’t as “bingable” for me as TNG or DS9. 

The costume design is something I’ve never seen anywhere else. The women’s costumes are especially revealing. Some of the men’s costumes are revealing too-- like that space-hippie from the Way to Eden who got a miniskirt. The uniforms look a lot more comfortable than the TNG era jumpsuits-- like you could actually wear something like that on a regular basis.

Set design: The enterprise still looks good, and futuristic to my mind. A lot of touch screens like they had in disco will probably look dated eventually. 

Cinematography: The lighting is interesting. They used a lot of colored gels, and in some cases will do a very tight shot and light only the eyes. They were a lot less concerned that the lighting appear like it could come from the environment of the shot. Compared to modern TV where cameras are very mobile, the shots are very fixed. . 

Casual sexism: Women can’t be starship captains? Jack the Ripper’s ghost targets women because they’re “more emotional.” The show is progressive in some ways, but shows its age in others. 

Kirk: Kirk doesn’t hook up with quite as many women as people joke about. He’s also a better captain than I remember. He makes some weird decisions, but for the most part his decisions make some kind of sense, he’s fair, and he tries diplomacy first. I think his reputation as an action hero comes from every planet he beams down to having someone knock him out and steal his communicator and phaser. 

Spock: The writers always seemed to be trying to find ways to put Spock in situations where he’s compromised and will show emotion. He’s kind of not that nice to his friends and very dismissive of humans. The main tension with McCoy comes not from him being stoic, but when he needs to make a decision that McCoy sees as heartless. When it’s reasonable to assume that the captain is dead, and McCoy wants to keep looking but there are other deadlines to adhere to, Spock prioritizes the other deadlines. 

McCoy isn’t as hotheaded as I remember. Most of his positions are well reasoned, but he argues for them passionately. 

Stories: In TNG and later there was more character growth through the series, and there were more stories driven by character interactions than TOS where there’s a lot more stories based just on the weirdness of external circumstances. The main characters are pretty much the same people at the end of TOS that they are at the start. I can’t really say that of TNG, DS9, VOY, or ENT. 

Continuity: a semi-coherent continuity isn’t something that they seemed to care about until later in TNG. Even then they felt okay retconing some stuff. TNG gave an explanation for why most species look human, but I don’t know if there was ever an explanation for why some civilizations are almost exactly parallel to Earth. Modern/Ancient Rome planet, for example. 

Vs. Trek 2009: I think TOS is the clear winner for me. For whatever reason recasting the main actors and making everything shiney feels cynical to me. I’m okay with the action-- TOS had fistfights almost every episode, after all. The story just doesn’t do much for me.

Plus the campiness of TOS make accepting some of the weird plot stuff easier for me. It's fun, so it doesn't matter too much that something or other doesn't make sense. The 2009 series has jokes, but they're self aware, and everything feels ""heavier,"" and less fun.",startrek,1567954490,fleemfleemfleemfleem,3,10,True,2019-09-08

1788,I've just got into Star Trek and this is one of the best decisions of my life.,"**TL;DR: I finally got to watch Star Trek and it is the most mesmerizing piece of fiction I delved into.**

Hi, I'm 26 years old, found myself in a bit of a cultural void where I felt I couldn't understand enough references, easter eggs and memes. So I crafted myself a small excel file with various sheets in it, each containing a list of every single movie, TV show and video game (as well as every book, comic book, anime show and manga - but in a smaller scale) that I've ever read/watched in my life, but mostly it was made to keep track of all the numerous recommendations and 'must-see'-s of titles that I deemed historically, academically and artistically important. A Movie-and-TV-show list specifically is over 1000 titles long with almost 600 of those waiting to be seen, including Star Trek: TSO

Last year I've decided to take a chronological approach and get myself familiar with the titles starting from the earliest (it being Fritz Lang's Metropolis, 1927). A couple of weeks ago I've finally got to the year 1966 and started watching TSO and honestly this is one of the best pieces of television I've seen. Yes the acting is a bit stiff and the rocks are made of styrofoam but the meticulously detailed and virtually perfect personality-idolizing machine-condemning retrofuturistic universe of the late 60s is so warm and fascinated I'm basically glued to the screen for tens of hours already.

I've picked the 'correct' order (TOS→TAS→Films (1-6)→TNG→*Generations* (Film #7)→DS9→VOY→Films 8-10→ENT→Films 11-13→DSC) and I'm having a pretty rad time.

It's a Great show.

1809,I had a fever and dreamt a strangely cool DS9 episode.,"I'm sick and binge watching DS9. It was an awful night but the fun thing is I had a DS9 dream, a whole new episode, I even remember the title: 

Who Cries Wolf.

It kinda even made sense, and I think it was pretty cool, so I wanted to share it.

So it started with a field of debris from a Federation starship in the Gamma Quadrant. We see a Jem'Hadar ship inspecting it and receiving a transmission. In it, the captain of the near-destroyed ship (we see explosions on the bridge) says that they stumbed upon something that looked like a decloaking ship. They raised shields to maximum, thinking it's Klingons or perhaps Jem'Hadar, but this wasn't a cloaked ship. It was some kind of anomaly, and raising shields caused it to fry everything on the ship. The captain warns: if you see something decloaking here, don't raise shie... BOOOM! End of transmission.

The Jem'Hadar look puzzled and suddenly something starts slowly decloaking. After a short discussion they lower their shields, believing this is the anomaly. Then BAM, it's Defiant that decloaks and blows the Jem'Hadar into smithereens. 

It was Kira's brilliant trap, a guerilla-style setup. Another JH ship scratched (for some reason she is hunting Jem'Hadar on the Defiant).

Long story short, our Federation heroes destroy a couple of others Jem'Hadar ships this way, creating a believabe transmission that some anomaly destroyed a ship because it raised shields, then starting to decloak, and then, when Jem'Hadar have shields lower, firing at them.

But eventually the Defiant comes upon a Jem'Hadar ship with no power, just floating there, claiming that a similar anomaly actually appeared and only after lowering shields they were able to survive.

Is this a trap? How could they know about this scheme, if there were no witnesses to warn them?

And oh crap, something looks like it's starting to decloak!

So the Defiant has to choose whether to trust the Jem'Hadar and risk to fall into Kira's own trap, or to keep shields raised in case there is a ship waiting for them.

I don't know how it ended, though, I woke up.",startrek,1568019988,szuran,19,112,True,2019-09-09

And my favorite series is no exception. Granted some of it was intentional but starting Sisko off by bashing the beloved Captain Picard was a risky move.

What is it with Star Trek and wanting to make the protagonist a jerk (and then having to fix it later)? Picard is insufferable in much of Season One. Sisko bashes Picard but this is after Picard has become likable in later seasons. Janeway was a Federation zealot. Archer was just overly emotional and impulsive to contrast T'Pol but came off looking stupid in the process.

Yet they all got better later. Even Enterprise with the Xindi arc and Season Four was starting to turn it around before they got canceled.

it wasn't specifically a Colt Python because those revolvers weren't rare as they were still being manufactured &amp; sold in gun stores when the TOS was written &amp; filmed. If that episode was filmed today it's likely Sulu would have come across a Python.

But just because all this tech exists, it does not mean everyone will use it for every purpose. It needs to be governed, but its application and usage is only limited to the capacity of the human mind (which may be augmented). E.g. Just because I can have 5000 friends on Facebook or millions on Twitter, it does not mean I can maintain personal relationships with everyone. Just because I can travel to any destination on Earth, it does not mean I would.

Future tech application and unlimited resources is limited in usage to societal norms and what we can conceive.

Regarding the plot, I have no clue. There probably is a major war, or one side wanting more influential power over another. I think it will be an ideological battle, but inter-character relationships and the ""human adventure"".",startrek,1564480713,zaid_mo,6,5,True,2019-07-30

Back in the 90's, I got 4 of the Innerspace sets from a shop in the town near where I lived. It wasn't even a toy shop, it just had a little toy shelf in among the paint and hardware. I had convinced my mother to get me one set per week, but they just stopped buying new ones after a month. I found out on eBay years later that there were way more set than I had thought - and they never had the big sets (phaser, tricorder, Enterprise, Comm badge) or the weird ones (Apollo modules). 

Adult me set out to right the injustice, armed with eBay account and credit card, and put together a complete set! And I do mean complete. Took some doing, but this set has all decals, cards, figures, accessories, doors, shuttles, etc., etc., all the stuff that's usually missing.

1858,"My friend had never seen TNG season 1, so I re-watched every episode and took notes. I thought you might enjoy.","Like many Trekkers, I love TNG but often warn people not to watch the first season because I considered it ""bad."" However, when my friend, and otherwise big TNG fan, said she hadn't watched it at all this just seemed wrong to me. So I decided to take one for the team and rewatch the whole first season, taking notes on what's worth watching. I had a fun time doing this, so I figured I'd share my notes with you. Note that of course all these opinions are my own, and highly subjective. Also I might have been drunk while making some. Feel free to fight me on them. 

1- ""Encounter at Farpoint"": Ok- interesting premise. Characters are all weird and wrong. Q looks good in goth lipstick. Must watch. 

2-""The Naked Now"": Data is *fully functional* and programmed in multiple techniques. Terrible but really a must-watch. 

3-""Code of Honor"": Horrible- racist AND boring. SKIP. 

4- ""The Last Outpost"": Dumb- first appearance of Ferengi. Skippable. 

5- ""Where No One Has Gone Before"": Good!- cool/weird scifi shit, “yer a wizard Wesley,” a truly amazing sweater. Def watch. 

6- ""Lonely Among Us"": Bonkers- Angry Lizard/rat people, pesky space anomaly, Riker is a vegetarian, return of the sweater, ill-advised Sherlock Holmes gag and so much more. Skippable but I enjoyed it. 

7- ""Justice"": Astoundingly ridiculous but has its moments. Plus sexy space joggers. Skippable, but why wouldn’t you want to watch the sexy space joggers?

8- ""The Battle"": Mostly forgettable but some mildly interesting Picard history. For some reason this episode has a sequel in season 7. Skippable anyway. 

9- ""Hide and Q"": Q def has the hots for Riker; Riker plays dumb but clearly enjoys it. Very weird episode. Watch for the WTFs. 

10-""Haven"": first appearance of Lwaxana! Riker’s porn choices are just videos of nice ladies playing harps? Deanna’s accent comes from her FATHER? Omg Tasha’s hair. Skippable but IMO worth watching. 

11-""The Big Goodbye"": Picard is very excited to tell his friends about his new video game- RELATABLE. Also he looks very sexy in a suit. Wesley tries to fix a computer using a microscope? Not a very good episode but interesting for early representation of holodeck magic. 

12 ""Datalore"": pros: Riker tries to trick a super intelligent Android with middle school level math, several “shut up Wesley!”s, Tasha’s hair looks particularly cute and dykey. Cons: Lore is just The Worst.
Ugh, watch I guess. 

13 ""Angel One"": “Do you ever feel like you’re not really wanted?”- Geordie, on how the feminist utopia planet isn’t falling over in excitement at the Enterprise’s arrival. 
This episode is awful, but it does feature a planet full of hot femdom women and men that look like cute soft butches. 

14- ""11001001"": Holodeck lady: gets created and immediately falls all over Riker. Riker: “wow this is so realistic!”
Idk man, there’s weird aliens and trombones, but otherwise pretty skippable. Holodeck lady does show up in a later season episode though. 

15-""Too Short a Season"": Oh look at this totally normal old guy. His skin isn’t fake or terrifying looking at all! I’m sure this old man won’t start aging in reverse about 10 min into the episode! Meh. Skip. 

16-""When the Bough Breaks"": the presence of “deep throat” from The X-Files makes me deeply distrustful of this mysterious alien society. Wesley, in true lesbian fashion, organizes a passive resistance movement with the other enterprise children. Not a terrible episode but def skippable. 

17-""Home Soil"": UGLY BAGS OF MOSTLY WATER. Not bad, mildly interesting scifi story but otherwise skippable. 

18-""Coming of Age"": it’s never a good sign when your “old friend” the admiral shows up. Apparently getting into Star fleet academy is really hard? Did everyone really pass this test? Even Tom Paris? Decent ep. Recommend watching because it sets up a later S1 episode that is definitely a must-watch. Also Picard says “charade” and I love when Picard says “charade.”

19-""Heart of Glory"": Riker: “smells like a trap. Let’s go!”
Picard completely forgets they’re on a rescue mission due to having a fun new toy to play with. Worf is SO excited to make Klingon friends. Deanna is mysteriously absent from this episode, probably because otherwise the plot would fall apart. 
First non-worf Klingons on TNG and they’re pretty good. Skippable, but watch for early character development of Worf. 

20-""The Arsenal of Freedom"": space pop up ads!! Geordie deals with one of Those Guys. Early fuel for the Jean-Luc/Beverly shippers. Skippable, but watch for an extremely goofy and slap-sticky scene where Crusher and Picard fall down a hole. 

21 """"Symbiosis"": Tonight, on a Very Special episode of TNG: Wesley learns that Drugs are Bad. Skip. 

22-""Skin of Evil"": RIP lesbian haircut. It’s dumb but I guess it’s a must-watch.

23-""We'll Always Have Paris"" : “what Picard hungers for is not on the menu.” Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey shenanigans, Picard’s romantic backstory. Skippable but watch for the charming awkwardness.

24- ""Conspiracy"": absolutely bananas and a total must-watch. No further comment. 

25- ""The Neutral Zone"": Worf is confused by doors.Why do you need to refrigerate people in an unmanned spacecraft? 
First instance of “captain?? Those  coordinates will take us straight into the neutral zone!”
Intriguing mystery overshadowed by goofy 80s plot
Gul dukat as a Romulan?? Probably should watch. 

General observations: the chief engineer changes like every episode. Data is a lot sassier in season 1. Picard is kind of a jerk. Riker is just Riker, beard or no. Overall, season 1 suffers from poor production quality, and a writing team that hasn't quite figured out who all the characters are yet, but I actually really enjoyed it. It's campy and fun with several pretty decent little science ficiton stories.

After the Picard trailer I decided that I should go ahead and finally watch DS9 and VOY for the first time. 
From what I’ve seen on the sub, DS9 is considered just as good if not better than TNG, which is exciting, but I hear a lot of mixed things about VOY. But 14 seasons of 45 min shows is a lot to watch for me and I definitely want to watch them before Picard airs in 2020, so I wanted to skip any episodes that just aren’t worth my time.
So my question is, are there lists of skippable episodes for either show? Especially for VOY. I keep seeing that when it’s good, it’s the best, but when it’s bad, it’s BAD.

Now that I'm watching TOS, TNG, and some of VOY again (all of which I had seen before seeing DS9), it's hard to compare all of them and tell if I really have a favorite. Beware, some slight spoilers below if you haven't seen the series.

One thing I thought of while watching DS9 -- they very rarely use full soundstage sets like the ones we saw in TNG. 

It seems like 90% of the time that they went to a Bajoran moon, Jem'Hadar base, Cardassian hideout, Maquis camp, Hur'q planet, it was always the same darned cave set! I had thought it was the ""Planet Hell"" / Paramount Stage 16 set, but it apparently that was more used in TNG / VOY.

Not an exhaustive list at all, but I can only think of a few examples where they weer able to show a larger world: The Quickening, Progress, The Storyteller, The Jem'Hadar, Past Tense, Far Beyond the Stars, By Inferno's Light, Rocks and Shoals. 

This is not to slight the series, as it really has some great story arcs and character development, and neither of these are really hurt by the lack of set / location variety. 

However, I did find myself missing some sense of adventure and larger scale when compared to the settings that the TNG crew got to shoot at. It shouldn't matter this much to me, but it was a little sad to go to major locations like Cardassia, Bajor, and Ferenginar and only see 1-2 interior sets besides the exterior matte paintings.

I don't have the DS9 companion and haven't read anything about this, but does anyone know the reason for this? I am leaving out the wonderful Promenade and station interiors, so I can understand if some more of the budget had to go towards that.",startrek,1564652041,alphavill3,4,3,True,2019-08-01

1916,Which episode had the best sci-fi concepts?,"Which episodes, regardless of execution, do you believe had the best sci-fi concepts? 

I've listed some of mine below in no particular order.

* (TNG)Timescape: I love the idea of time being frozen but what elevates the concept for me is the discovery that the snapshot we're presented with could be interpreted completely the wrong way.

* (TNG)Thine Own Self: The idea is actually quite simple but I found the concept to be really interesting, seeing Data recklessly take the radioactive metal fragments from the casing always gets me. 

* (VOY) Course: Oblivion: A twist that is almost impossible to see coming to even hardened Star Trek vets, the cast do a great job of conveying the feeling of hopelessness and desperation until the very end.

* (DS9)Whispers: Those “punish O’Brien” episodes had some really great concepts and this is probably my favourite. Like “Course: Oblivion”, an episode where we see through the eyes of a duplicate and are dumbfounded when we find out.

* (ENT) Statagem: In a way similar to “In the Pale Moonlight” in that the crew must put together a convincing deception in a life or death situation. I enjoyed the method employed here to try and trick Degra and found it quite ""realistic"" for Star Trek.

* (ENT) Similitude: This along with “Cogenitor” form a duo of interesting episodes dealing with Trip, biology and ethics (less said about “Dear Doctor” the better). This episode is like “Tuvix” in many ways and I enjoyed the concept and the dilemma.

* (VOY)Blink of an Eye: It’s hard to find an episode where there was a bigger prime directive fuck up. Seeing how the planet evolved with Voyager's influence was fascinating.

* (DS9)Children of Time: A concept so intriguing it was done twice (See E2). This was not only a fascinating idea but also allowed for a long-awaited advancement in the Kira-Odo relationship

* (VOY)The Thaw: A really unique take on the interaction between man and machine, with an eminently memorable villain.

* (VOY) Latent Image: The exploration of the sentience, rights and evolution of a holograms in Voyager was one of its greatest achievements and it rarely got better than this.

* (VOY)Tuvix: A controversial episode with a controversial decision. That this episode has led to many debates speaks volume as to how interesting its central concept was.

* (VOY)Before and After: The combined concepts of a species with a 9 year lifespan with a really unique take on the “time travel hijinx” episode type made this a unique episode. 

* (VOY)Ashes to Ashes: The execution was somewhat lacking but the concept that a dead crewman could come back and directly question the reason for their death was full of promise as a concept.

I know there are plenty of great TOS concepts in particular but I’m only working my way through the original show now, so excuse me for not listing any",startrek,1564683763,simpsonsgoldenage,16,20,True,2019-08-01

Maybe because all the bad reviews it gets in chats like this one, my opinion went down over the years; but the truth is I liked it when it was released, and I still like it. I may even like it more! It has some of the best space battles in Star Trek. We got really beautiful shots of one of my favourite ships, the Enterprise-E. It has some great acting, in my opinion, specially from Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy. The story is not bad, although it has some holes (what movie doesn't have them?). We finally got Romulans as main villains. It is good to see Riker and Troi finally marrying. And Data's death... That always really moved me. Of course it could have been better, and some of the deleted scenes should have made it to the movie... but it was not a bad last episode for TNG era.

You read a really cool book or comic (or series of them) and an episode or movie comes out and is like ""Yeah, that never happened.""

Sometimes it seems like there's no choice for the authors of the expanded stories.  The novels and comics pumped out stories after   Star Trek II, II , IV, and VI were released, even though the movies all took place practically back to back.  The writers (and the readers) had to know that these comics were not only going to be canon, but after a while had to know that there weren't ever going to be able to fit into the greater Trek continuity. 

It doesn't even seem safe when the onscreen Trek writers are involved.  The comic series ""Countdown"" was written by Bob Orci and Alex Kurtzman themselves, and it already looks like ""Picard"" is going to go in a different direction. 

And this makes me think of how Lucasfilm approached their expanded stories, at least from the mid-90's on.  They had an editorial team hard at work to make sure that the books, comics, and even the videogames all lined up into a bigger saga.  Yeah, it became null and void once Disney bought them, but even then, they've been rebuilding.  

Why was this approach never taken with Trek?  I have enjoyed reading Trek books and comics throughout the years, but I never saw them as anything more than ""fluff.""

Why is a little kid stearing the ship?  He's at the bridge stearing the ship that makes no sense.  So you have data who is second officer and beside him you have the lowest ranking officer.

It would allow for an anthology type show exploring various time periods and crews throughout the Federation’s history, but be manageable from an expense standpoint, I’d much if the action takes place on the ship. 

While I’m intrigued by the possibility, I’m also apprehensive as *Star Trek* doesn’t exactly have a history of treating time travel with the consistency and consideration it merits.

1988,Best fancanon/headcanon theories about Star Trek?,"I keep seeing a lot of headcanon/fancanon theories posted on this sub to explain discrepancies and odd things in Trek.

Post them, lets see who has the best ones.

- Picard went through a string of bad chief engineers in Season 1, and their repeated failures to save the ship (the saving was ultimately done by LaForge, Data, and Wesley) resulted in LaForge getting the Chief Engineer job at the start of season 2.

- All of Star Trek Enterprise takes place on the Enterprise D's Holodeck. Riker idolized Jonathan Archer since the academy and has been running the program playing the role of the chef since his first experience with the holodeck during the Farpoint mission. The program is loosely based on the NX-01's logs, mission reports, and personnel files but the computer has had to fill in many of the gaps resulting in various historical discrepancies. The time travel plot, the Xindi, and various other out-there plot lines are the result of Riker toying with the program out of boredom or trying to work out various problems in his real life.

- Picard has an accent because he is actually speaking French and the Universal Translator is translating

- Admiral Pressman's ""friends"" at Starfleet command were Section 31.

- Worf is a paragon of Klingon society because he grew up with humans and everything he ""knows"" about Klingon history, culture, and honor comes from books which painted an idealized version of Klingon society.

- The Vulcans underwent genetic engineering in their past with similar results to Earth Eugenics Wars. The modern day Romulans, Remans, Vulcans and other sub species are a result of this tampering. This is why the agreed to the Human led ban on genetic engineering in the Federation.

- The Federation didn't really *win* the first Cardassian war, it was their Vietnam. The Federation diplomatic core gave away everything of value in that sector to make the peace agreement work because the Federation was unwilling to commit the ships and resources needed to fight the war effectively. This disenfranchised many Star Fleet officers and they sided with the colonists to found the Maquis. Since the end of hostilities with the Klingons and Romulans, the Federation had grown too large and complacent, and lacked the ships and experienced personnel needed to fight a large scale conflict. It took the Borg threat to finally kick the Federation out of its complacency.

- The Borg Queen allowed 7of9 to join the Voyager crew as a Trojan horse so she could get first hand experience with humans from a Borg perspective. The idea being that her knowledge would help the Borg ultimately assimilate mankind.",startrek,1564866082,DarkAlman,40,19,True,2019-08-03

DS9, I believe wants to look at Star Trek more realistically, and while that means shining a light on the flaws of the Federation, it also means that they also showed how they got to where they are, if Star Trek Earth can go from shunning the poor, unemployed, and mentally ill while also blowing themselves up in a horrific war to eliminating all that,becoming the linchpin of a galactic federation and apparently abolishing money, why can't we?",startrek,1564884169,CGTM,31,55,True,2019-08-03

2010,The epitome of DS9's friendships/relationships is opposites,"My SO is going through Star Trek for the first time (and thoroughly enjoying it for someone who wasn't even that into sci-fi to begin with). She's on season 6 of DS9 at the moment, and something I realised that DS9 excels at is creating friendships out of people who are essentially opposite personalities, or at least their strongest characteristics are opposite each other.

The most obvious of these is Jake and Nog, where the former is a tried and true son of the Federation. He's creative, imaginative, and has no fear telling his father that he'd rather be a writer than in Starfleet (which Sisko is OK with, of course). Nog is clever, pragmatic, not to mention ambitious in his endeavours (whether it's acquiring things or his work), but didn't want to be limited like his father even if he didn't say it outright for a while.

Miles and Julian is another, and they're far more defined. Miles is a day-in, day-out guy who enjoys his job, his family, his pint, and a good night's sleep. Julian is starry-eyed, at least in the beginning, and is always trying to push boundaries and charm his way into everything. And yet, they became the greatest friendship on the show. 

You see it in all the major relationships that form on the show: Dax/Kira, Dax/Worf, Kira/Odo, Dax/Sisko, Quark/Odo, even Nog and Garak had an interesting relationship after the Empok Nor incident. 

It allowed the characters not only to highlight their own personalities, but to challenge those personalities than they would otherwise be if they were just blank exposition slates.",startrek,1564930541,josephgordonreddit,4,9,True,2019-08-04
2011,What you lose by being serialized instead of episodic: the normal.,"A lot has been written about the pros and cons of episodic vs. serialized television, and I think pretty much everyone's points are valid. Which just goes to show that I don't think one can be said to be better than the other. How well done they are matters most. So this isn't an argument for episodic storytelling, just an observation. 

Episodic Trek almost always starts out with the normal. Normal uber mission, checking out a space signal, taking a holiday, etc. And then something abnormal happens and off we go into the episode. It's the normal we start off with that I think is lost in serialized storytelling. We get that sense of normalcy in two ways: both in the glimpses of it at the beginning of each episode, and in the routine of starting each episode off that way; the routines of the crew are itself a routine for the viewer. 

This sense of daily life was always fascinating to me; I always loved just being a voyeur into starship life. Watching Data perform in a concert, Troi and Crusher doing calisthenics, the normal beeps and hums on the bridge, etc. Come to think of it I would love a version of Big Brother: Enterprise!",startrek,1564930977,witness_protection,279,706,True,2019-08-04

2016,"Rewatching ENT, what a worthless crew!","Okay, so I'm currently rewatching ENT. The series isn't that bad. It's pale compared to most other Trek series, but I like it. But I just had to let it out: what an utterly worthless crew!

First of all: Archer. Worst captain ever. He has absolutely no qualities at all. He is immature, irrational, uncharismatic and when the male members of his crew behave like little school boys (which happens a lot), instead of putting them in place he just goes along with the jargong. No captain was perfect, and that's a good thing, but this dude is plainly incompetent.

And then we have Tucker. Stupid. Macho jerk. He makes Tom Paris look like the gentleman of the year. Can't figure out how the hell that bum got through Starfleet Academy. He has his moments, but they are few. 

Mayweather is okay, but he's just a school boy and he doesn't exactly leave an impression.

Reed is just boring. You wouldn't even notice if he had been deleted from the show.

Sato does her best, but to be honest, she is not fit to serve on a starship. She has serious anxiety problems and doesn't have the necessary psyche to handle the job. Fortunately, she grows with the task, at least a little.

The only ones who are any good are the non humans, Phlox and T'Pol, but even T'Pol is pretty bad. She's competent, but her social skills are beyond terrible. All vulcans seem a bit dry, but she is rude. Not a good strategy when you live so close together with your crew. You would think that she would be able to use her logic to come up with a better social strategy.

And I understand, this takes place way before the other series. Humans weren't as used to space travel and dealing with other species. They had to learn a thing or two before they could reach the level they were at in TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY and so on. But ENT is still taking place in the future. And not even the military officers or astronauts of today would be as dumb as this gang. As far as diplomacy, social skills and logic goes, ENT is several steps backwards from where we are today. 

I've read all possible ideas in defence of this, but the way I see it, it's just a mistake. ENT is a victim of bad writing and bad casting, by people who weren't really intellectual enough to take on a show like Star Trek.",startrek,1564941087,rattlesnakejake90,15,0,True,2019-08-04

You want more evidence?

Gul Dukat hates bajorans. Bajorans are notably religious. What hates religious people? Fish. Ever seen Jaws? Replace a shark with a cardassian and it’s still the same. 

Fish smell. Cardassians smell. Neither know how to take a sonic shower. Cardassians hate the Federation. Who else hates the Federation? The fish people who turned Kirk into a fish in TAS. Kirk got revenge by whale-napping George and Gracie. George and Gracie revealed the Federation’s secrets to Cardassia. George and Gracie are Cardassian spies.

Yes, it has issues (shitty VFX &amp; recycled music), but it's actually a pretty damn fun/funny movie. I think there are more moments of humor and levity in this than in any other ST movie, also some deep moments (McCoy &amp; Spock with their fathers). It's got some great lines (""I liked him better before he died!""), and the Kirk/Spock/McCoy dynamic is stronger here than in any of the other movies. I even kind of like the idea that this incarcerated alien has lured these people under the pretense of being God, while actually just plotting a jail-break.

2039,Gushing about Deep Space Nine.,"What I'm about to say is probably not new, and I'm not the first and won't be the last one to go nuts over this show. 

I started watching Star Trek (TNG) last December. While I knew that the show would be absolute cheese, it resonated with me like nothing before. The setting of the show, and the background ideology were somethings I could get behind easily. The characters and situations were unique enough and kept me going through the series to find out what would be. But once I was done with TNG, it didn't leave a lasting impression.

Since I started watching ST, I began perusing a lot of clips on YouTube. I began to take a liking to ones from DS9. From the clips I saw, I pieced together the general setting and characters, so I wasn't going in completely blind. 

Everything about DS9 felt like an improvement over TNG. The nature of the setting allowed for a serialised format and meant there would be some continuity between episodes. The show took a less ""black and white"", but a more ""gray"" approach to the characters and writing, and that really worked for me. The writing felt a lot stronger and more entertaining. 

The biggest improvement for me was the lost of characters. DS9s characters were so memorable in their depth and nuance. Recurring characters were just as brilliant as the regular cast. Worf and O'Brien got a well needed boost for their characters from TNG. 

I could keep going on about how much I love the show, but there's only so much I'm willing to type. 

I will say that the final episode was a proper culmination of the series. I felt a bit bad that Jadzia's character didn't get a tribute, but other than that I was satisfied with how everyone's arcs were wrapped up. 

I'm glad I went on that journey. It was unforgettable.",startrek,1564987817,Megazord552,17,44,True,2019-08-05

The only person he does not want to kill is Odo, being a Changeling, and Odo attempts to curb this instinct to kill in order to attempt to peacefully assimilate him with other races. Kira warns him that some people cannot be changed, though Odo insists on trying. Ultimately this fails and while the boy attempts to secure a runabout to get back home, Odo promises to take him home to avoid any further problems.

At the end of the episode, Odo visits Kira on the promenade, telling her solemnly that she was right.

2044,Played a great game of Star Trek: Ascendancy last night.,"We played with four players: The Federation, the Romulans, the Ferengi and the Cardassians. I was the Ferengi. We also knew that the Borg would turn up at some point.

As the Ferengi, I first encountered Risa and turned it into a productive planet (the Ferengi don't really do culture). One of my ships then explored a new system and both the ship - and system - were lost to the Crystalline Entity. My third system was even more bad luck - I'd encountered a Borg cube, currently assimilating Bajor. 

I immediately retreated everything back to Ferenginar, and the Cube hurtled to my homeworld (If my homeworld got assimilated, I would be out of the game and would get to play as the borg) and fought my fleet. As the cube adapted to my weapons, my last two ships had to flee. It had easy access to Ferenginar. 

While this is happening, the other players were building up their fleets, but there was no way that they would get there in time. 

Then I was hit by a stroke of good look: the Borg Cube decided it was more interested in my ships than my homeworld and chased one of them before blowing it up. 

Meanwhile, the Romulans triggered something which caught the Cube's attention. It transwarped near Romulus. I had to rebuild - all those ships lost, what an awful loss of profits (and lives, I guess).

The Borg took over the system right next to Romulus and started constructing a second Borg Cube while everyone sent what they could over to stop the Borg before they became too powerful. A Romulan fleet, a Federation fleet, a Cardassian fleet and a single Ferengi ship launched an attack on the Borg....and blew it up before it could even shoot back (my single ship got the last hit).

However, the structure on the planet took much longer to wipe out, with the Romulans, Federations and Cardassians losing a fleet to it until a large Romulan strike took it out.

While everyone was focused on the Borg, the Federation managed to gain an insane amount of production and had too many ships than they could properly use (they were only able to form two small fleets at this stage, so moving ships was a huge cost of turns) and the Cardassian player had developed multiple planets of culture - which is one of the two ways to win the game (the other is taking control of two other players' homeworlds).

The Federation launched a large attack on the Cardassians (who had attacked nobody, and helped defend Romulus), but couldn't penetrate their defences. The Cardassians had become so culturally powerful that they were seen as the ""good guys"" and the main superpower of the Alpha/Beta quadrants. 

It's a really enjoyable game, even if it is a long one (5 hours). While the outcome in this game may seem odd, the Federation are geared towards being peaceful while the Cardassians are more agressive and enslaving. Player choices, mixed with what planets they discovered, led to the outcome. Despite being battered by the Borg, both the Ferengi and Romulans weren't that far behind.

1. The Enterprise D's destruction
2. Introduced the Enterprise B
3. Loved the dynamic with Admiral Kirk at the beginning.
4. Really enjoyed the Nexus and it's other-worldly ability to mess with people's heads.
5. Kirk chopping wood

The worst part about the movie was the villain, that silly doctor guy. The ending could have been cooler if it was more about stopping the Nexus or Kirk/Picard needing to work together to escape it, than fighting him.

2060,Mirror Universe Episode Idea for DS9,"I've never been a fan of ""The mirror universe"" in trek. Episodes that take place in it are generally my least favorite. They're not ""Threshold"" bad but they're close to it. 

So I was watching the second half of Discovery season 1, thinking about how boring it is to watch a string of mirror universe episodes back to back. And thinking about how DS9's take on serialized trek story telling was, in my opinion, much better than what Discovery was doing at least in season 1.

Then I had a great idea. Like I said, I wasn't really a fan of any of the DS9 mirror universe episodes. But hows about this scenario: Some amount of our beloved DS9 her's get thrown into the mirror universe due to some treknobabble anomaly. They get there, and it's the DS9 mirror universe we got from the show, with all the good guys being bad, and the bad guys being good, and O'Brien being O'Brien. A dramatic cat and mouse game leads to ""our"" guys stealing a ship and getting off the station just in time, with the help of Dukat, aboard a klingon ship.  He's a genuinely nice guy, genuinely helping our heros. In order to hide, ""our"" heros direct ducat to fly to the wormhole, which is still there but nobody in that universe knows about it. That pass through - we skip fleshing out what the deal is with the mirror universe wormhole aliens - and on the other side of the wormhole.... we meet the dominion. (Dukat goes to the dominion in a klingon ship, again) Only this dominion is JUST LIKE OUR FEDERATION. They're good guys, their ships are the same styling, but not ""warships"", just regular ships. Maybe they even have a structure similar to federation ships. There are many delta quadrant species on the ships working together, including misc shape shifters. It would literally be a united federation of planets. And when they find out about the mirror universe, they help our heros get back to the right universe. 

Again I'm not a fan of mirror universe episodes. But that story line occurred to me last night, and I got really excited. That would have been awesome to see and very mind-blowing. Compare that to the dull stories we got about Kira being bad and humans being abused and there not being any consequence since it wasn't even our universe.

It also shows you how internal damage, like say the Turbolifts getting destoryed, on how they can fix them in matter of hours, or even minutes.

Because for instance in Scorpion 1 and 2 when they put the Borg tech on, even with some Drones on there it would probably take months with that little amount of man power to outfit those Borg piecies.

2077,"Thoughts on TNG ""The High Ground""","Hi all, I just watched this episode last night and although I really enjoyed it I was surprised to see it got a lukewarm reception over on /r/StarTrekViewingParty and elsewhere on reddit. I've seen the whole show probably two or three times through but this is the first time I've seen this episode in years and it felt like a sleeper gem to me. 

A lot of people seemed to think that the subject of terrorism was handled in a very sophomoric way but I strongly disagree, and I took something out of the episode that other people did not, from what I can tell.

To me, the whole point of the episode was not to show that the terrorists were less malevolent than everyone thought, but to show that everyone else was really not as innocent as they pretended to be. No player in the conflict had clean hands, from the terrorists themselves to the overbearing police force to even the federation, who was essentially supporting an immoral government for their own gain and looking the other way.

No side was quite willing to admit this to themselves but each felt uncomfortable with the other two factions. You had the overtly hostile terrorists on one side. On another sat the police officer, who was clearly upset at Riker's willingness to negotiate, while Riker himself was disarmed at the draconian tactics of the government. 

Essentially, the conflict kept escalating because no side was willing to back down. This, in my opinion, is the significance of the final dramatic moment of the show, where the young boy chooses not to shoot Riker. This is a victory for all sides not because a young boy realized how bad being a terrorist was, but because he had the maturity - more maturity than everyone else - to back down and choose to deescalate conflict rather than incite it. This is a complex topic that I felt the episode broached very well and so I liked it a lot. Besides that, the villain gave a good performance. 

I will admit the episode had flaws. Here are some of them that I noticed, bulletpointed:

• Wesley Crusher deciphering the villain's technological situation in 3.5 seconds flat

• The fact that only one terrorist and one police officer were characters, rather than two or several of each

• Beverly Crusher's complete lack of agency",startrek,1565097243,HicorySauce,9,7,True,2019-08-06

2083,[Music Question] imagine these musical themes in Star Trek TOS.,"
scenario for context: An alternate TOS scenario where the Enterprise ends up in another galaxy and must seek a wormhole back to the milky way galaxy. During their quest, they find themselves caught in a great struggle and crisis that has befallen the galaxy:

- A Romeo and Juliet-esque feud between two most Prominent and powerfil Interstellar Kingdoms of this Galaxy. 

- A Prophecy that speaks of a powerful cosmic entity that will return in one Earth-Month and destroy the Galaxy, but also speaks of the return of the Guardian entity of the Galaxy and the restoration of Peace to the realm.

The first one would be the more immediate of the two crises. As it would lead Kirk and His crew across different worlds to figure out how to put an end to the feud as well as leading them to discover a secret and forbidden romance between the two young successors of the two kingdoms. 

In addition, A mysterious presence or energy has attached itself to the ship and made it's home in the Enterprise's computer. Throughout this journey, the mysterious presence would help them in dire situations where the ship is nearly destroyed in ""No-win"" scenarios as well as through enhancing the ship's phasers,deflector beam and shields (phaser and deflector beam color being consistently gold and the shields visibly producing intricate and elegant patterns sparkling and glowing in gold). 

The presence is acknowledged by the crew and communicates to certain members in cryptic fashion that leads them to have to interpret what it is trying to say to them. It eventually begins to speak to them in the latter half of the journey. As they are about to resolve the feud of the two kingdoms. Revealing itself to be the lost guardian prophesized to return. It had defeated said destruction entity thousands of years in the past but at the cost of sacrificing much of it's power. Up until that point had existence in a weakened state before the Enterprise crossed paths with it. It regained some much of it's power during the journey, though despite this, it is still unable to leave the Enterprise's computer as it still hasn't regained it's full powers yet. Though it will prepare the Enterprise for the final confrontation with the destroyer entity, as Kirk and crew will have to participate in the battle.

And so for the musical themes:

- [Theme 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDDj6FAjY9Q): The Destroyer Entity manifests before the Enterprise and the combined fleets of Both the newly united Kingdom. both are in awe at the ssheer size of the entiy, before engaging into battle. The Enterprise leading the way as the fleet flies towards the entity. All ships open fire, all their combined firepower plus the Enterprise's own enhanced phasers dealing damage to the entity. The entity shrieking and responding back by attacking the combine fleet.

[Theme 2]  After seemingly defeating defeating the destroyer entity. The wormhole that brought the Enterprise into this galaxy appears. After the Crew and the kingdoms bid their farewells. The guardian entity is about to part ways, before the destroyer entity reappears, having feigned it's destruction and flies into the portal. Causing the enterprise, carrying the Guardian with them, to go into hot pursuit. Reports coming from the engine room describe the engines emitting golden light. The Bridge is also envolved by this golden light as well. The entity begins to show signs of regaining it's power, as Tendrils of golden light erupt from the Enterpise's hull and wrap around the ship. changing into armor made from light. The ship then warps in the wormhole to catch to the destructor entity, firing it's phasers into the beast and dealing heavy damage to the entity. Like a knight in shining armor battling a malevolent dragon, the fate of the milky way and the federation being at stake.

[Theme 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WMhj9ZVcg&amp;t=17s) The final struggle. With most of the fleets of the federation stationed at Sector 001 in a stand to protect Earth from the from oncoming Destructor Entity. The Enterprise leads the way into battle. The Guardian entity has finally  regained it's power and is finally ready to let go of the Enterprise. after making a farewell monologue and thanking Kirk and crew for accompanying them on their journey,the guardian finally releases it's hold on the Enterprise. Showing it's angelic true form in all it's glory. It then heads for the destructor to finish it off for good. The Federation fleet watches in awe as two great cosmic entities battle each other. Finally the Guardian telepathically reaches out to the Federation fleet. It tells them that it's going to hand the final blow to them and it's now their turn strike. Immediately orders are made to prepare the deflector beams and load the photo torpedoes. The order to fire is given simultaneously and a hail of photon torpedoes and deflector beams strikes at the destructor entity. delivering the final blow,",startrek,1565106759,Newman1651,0,0,True,2019-08-06

Could he ever truly understand humans if he cannot experience regular frustration at the limitations of his abilities as humans often do?

B4 went too far the other way and was not self-aware enough to understand the extent of his own abilities (he may have had a more simple child-like mind but I assume he still had many physical advantages over humans as well as enough processing power to at least be able to store and retrieve information faster than humans can)

It would be really interesting to see a scenario where Data (either by choice or by circumstance) temporarily has to operate on a mental level on par with that of his crewmates. Having to spend time to learn things at a human pace and developing techniques to commit them to memory. Even having to live with human level strength and frailty.

* I half expected O'Brien to answer how many lights there were, but instead he had a molar removed. Ouch.

* Jem'Hadar dude casually walks out of containment field. These guys are playing nice. 

* Kira's reaction when she heard about New Bajor (I presume it was New Bajor, but he only said it was a colony).  I got a ""this is cardassians again, but much worse"" vibe from her face. 

* Quark's critique of humanity was a doozy.  Also Quark's realization about the ""suppression"" neck band was nice to see.  And tulaberry wine was a great callback.

""It was always telling great stories, complicated stories, modern parables—but we live in a much, much more complicated and darker times than that and Trek at its best has always been a mirror that's reflected the world that we live in""

TNG was made during a time of Cold War, Bosian genocide, recession etc, and it's lazy to call a time more innocent just because it's retrospective. While TNG touched on these very real world issues, it was still a beacon of idealism and hope, that things could be worked out.

The Trekspertise team is putting together a little something where we want to include every console explosion ever to happen in the Star Trek franchise in a video edit. Think of a massive montage of exploding consoles. 

But, we need some help. We don't know how many really exist and where they all are. 

That's where you come in. Most of you are watching Star Trek day to day, week to week. You see these consoles exploding all the time (it is a real problem). We'd like to ask that if you see one to come here to Reddit or to tag us on Twitter (@trekspertise or @neoteotihuacan) and tell us which episode and, if possible, about what time the console explosion appears. Time stamps are most helpful, but not mandatory. 

For example, we know there is a few exploding console scenes in Star Trek: Generations, during the battle with the Duras Sister's ship. There is one in the Star Trek: Discovery season 1 episode, ""Battle At The Binary Stars"" and more in TNG's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" during the fight with the Klingons there. 

That's it. That's all we are asking for. Maybe through a little crowdsourcing we can create a list of every console explosion ever in the Star Trek franchise. Interested? 

Interested? If you are, we can give a public shoutout to you and to this Reddit community in the video. Looking forward to your responses. Many thanks for those of you willing to help us =)",startrek,1565201559,neoteotihuacan,13,6,True,2019-08-07

2143,I have a problem with Janeway and Food Replicators,"First off, she's a brilliant and accomplished scientist, but when it comes to the replicator, it's like trying to teach your great grandmother how to use windows 98.

Secondly, why would the replicator even allow you to burn something?  Sure, maybe she's messing with the ""cook time"" but she ruins it every time, so I would think all those important dinners she has with people, she would eventually just leave it alone at the default setting so as not to ruin her guests meal.

Third, why would she eat that??? And force others too?  They have the ability to recycle everything.  She could just make it again, before even removing it from the replicator.

The only explanation that deals with the 3rd complaint, is that it might use a waste a little energy to recycle, but I doubt they'd be using replicators in the first place if their energy was that low. Sure, maybe she doesn't to waste her rations, but again it just seems like a very stupid joke, even by Voyager standards (I love Voyager, don't hate).

Anyways, the only reason I posted this is because I don't think a lot of people have considered the recycle factor, and that there really is no excuse to let this happen lol. 

I think at this point, the only logical conclusion is that Captain Janeway is testing a new standup routine involving ill-tempered food replicators, and she has been subjecting her crew to it for over 7 years.",startrek,1565230192,TheLastSheriff,30,11,True,2019-08-07
2144,"Deep Space Nine (Season2, Episode 14) Is Chief O'Brien still Cheif O'Brien?","I'm in the process of watching all of DS9 and I just finished Season2, Episode 14. The episode is all about how cheif O'Brien believes people on DS9 have been overtaken by someone/something. He has just gotten back to DS9 from mission with the Paradas dealing with security measures having to do with a civil war they will be meeting on DS9 about. People around Cheif O'Brian had been seemingly acting strange but still somewhat normal. As the episode continues you can tell things arnt right. They question him about the Paradas frequently, raising his suspicions. Locking him out of high security database/logs and lack of affection from his wife deepens the suspicion amongst other things as it continues. Cheif O'Brien makes a break for it stealing a runabout and getting away to the Parada System. He is chased by Mekong and in order to lose them goes to Parada 4 which has 7 moons. He maneuvers himself around one of the moons and loses Mekong. They dont look long and set a new course to Parada 2.(THIS LAST PART IS THE REASON FOR THE POST) Cheif O'Brien follows Mekong to Parada 2, once he is sure everyone is off the Mekong he asks the computer how many humans are on Parada 2. The computer answers 3! Cheif O'Brien beams down to the surface, at first you see Captain Sisko, first officer Kira and two rebel aliens. They explain to Ceif O'Brien that everything will make sense if he looks behind the door and to put his weapon down. He doesn't comply and orders them to drop there weapons, as they begin to one of the rebel aliens shoots Cheif O'Brian and the door opens. Behind the door is Doctor Bashir and.... Cheif O'Brien!!!! They continue to say that the one they shot was a replica of the Cheif that they believe had been created to sabotage the civil war treaty. They go on to explain to the ""real"" O'Brien that they had been tipped that he was captured to make the copy O'Brien explaining to the audience why everyone was so strange. But... one thing doesnt add up.... Cheif O'Brien asked the computer before beaming down how many humans were on Parada 2 with the computer said 3. Head count.. we have Captian Sisko, First officer  Kira, Doctor Bashir AND Cheif O'Brien. Now wouldn't that make it 4... So did they kill the real O'Brien?

2151,Potential Spoilers - Picard speculation based on casting,"Pure speculation post, wanted to share some thoughts and theories. 

1. I think that the Picard series may include flashback storylines for some characters. 

Two reasons - firstly some of the shots in the trailer may not be what we assume they are, for example some of the prison shots and borg. The scene with Data  may also be a flashback if it’s not on a holodeck. The fact that Spiner says he’s playing Data and not B4 makes me believe that. 

Second reason is that IMDB shows a few actors who are either named “young (character name here)” or whose characters are not named but resemble younger versions of the core cast. I don’t think in 2019 they’d repeat Rascals so it’s either for flashback or character establishing scenes in the first episode. 

2. Watching some Romulan related TNG has been enlightening, especially in relation to the Tal Shiar. There may be a situation where the Tal Shiar and other parts of Romulan society have split. The Tal Shiar might be the enemy in this show. IMDB also lists a cast member playing the part of an un-named Tal Shiar Officer so it seems certain the writers haven’t forgotten about them. Watching Face of the Enemy makes me think it may be the reason for Marina Sirtis to appear beyond it just being a nice thing. I can see how Picard might seek Troi for guidance prior to or during the mission. Marina Sirtis was great in Dark Sublime by the way.",startrek,1565274231,rymerster,16,2,True,2019-08-08

2153,An entire series set in the Mirror Universe,"Maybe I'll be alone in this but I for one would really enjoy a whole MU series. 

My reasoning is that all of the new Star Trek doesn't really feel like Trek. It's lost the philosophy and turned it into just another sci-fi show. While you could argue that this was lost with the ending of TNG, I would argue that Voy/DS9/Ent were able to play with the philosophy without completely abandoning it. Bending but not breaking.

But the Mirror Universe is designed to be this way, TV/Movie execs could wank themselves off with 'what modern audiences want' without ruining what makes ST... well ST. After all, we would just handwave it away as the Mirror Universe with no bearing on the 'normal' timeline. 

There wouldn't need to be any retconning, or prequels that make no in-universe sense, or sequels that seem to be built purely on fan service (I really hope Picard will be good, but I'm very cynical). 

Plus, who wouldn't want to see a sci-fi show where it's the Humans who are the big bad, rather than the saviour/hero trope most multi-species sci-fi depict us as.",startrek,1565276149,jm434,10,0,True,2019-08-08

2155,What We Left Behind - Some Stray Thoughts (Spoilers I guess),"I watched the documentary last night and had a few thoughts on it.  

First the good stuff:

* Full disclosure: I am a DS9 mega-fan. It's one of my favorite shows of all time and definitely my number one Star Trek show. I have a great deal of fondness for the majority of the people in this film. That certainly makes it easy for me to enjoy it though it does make it hard to be objective.
* Despite being a mega-fan, I did learn a lot of behind the scenes stuff I wasn't aware of.
* Apparently I've been pronouncing a lot of their names wrong all these years. I'm so sorry Colm Meaney and Nana Visitor!
* Speaking of Visitor, I love **love** LOVE her in this! She looks like she's barely aged a day but for her gorgeous gray locks. I love how passionate she is about the series, her character, and what it means to people. She is the heart and soul of this documentary.
* I loved Cirroc Lofton's stories of how Avery Brooks was like a father to him in real life.
* Aron Eisenberg was another standout, I found his segments very moving.
* The remastered footage was absolutely gorgeous.

And now stuff that um...kind of rubbed me the wrong way:

* I'm not in love with the overall self-congratulatory tone. As much as I love Ira Steven Behr, he's making a full-length documentary about how great his show, cast, and crew are. I mean, yeah those things are great, but a lot of it is him patting himself on the back. It's an artifact of Behr being both the filmmaker and the main subject of the film. I think I would have preferred someone else directing.
* Speaking of people patting themselves on the back, I think they're giving themselves too much credit for the social issues. Yes, DS9 did tackle a lot of social issues. Sometimes it was fantastic, sometimes not so much. The framing device of Behr and his editor talking about them in the editing room was really weird. Behr is letting himself off the hook far too easily on LGBTQ issues. 2018 Behr looking back at mid-90's Behr saying that ""oh, we should have done more on this issue"" with the benefit of full hindsight and total lack of consequences comes off as very hollow to me. The fact is that DS9 really dropped the ball on this one. Two women in a relationship was played off for titillation, a man changing gender was played off as a farce. At no point were gay characters or relationships ever normalized. They claim that Garak was gay-- and I believe Andy Robinson when he says he played him that way. I don't believe for a second he was written that way. I get this was the still hetero-normative 90s and there were limits on what the studio was going to let them get away with. But maybe don't get on the soapbox for not doing anything when it mattered.
* Behr taking credit for having black people on TV was **really** weird to me. 
* The season 8 pitch was also really weird to me. Don't get me wrong, I love their ideas and I would be a million percent on board for it to actually happen (although, let's be real, it's never going to happen). But maybe this isn't the right platform to promote this and it kind of takes away from the actual documentary.
* Marc Alaimo comes off as an asshole and a gross creepy old man in this. There's a part where he's talking about it was easy for him to play Dukat as desiring Kira because he (the actor Alaimo) desired Visitor. I cannot fucking believe they left that in the film.
* Hoo boy, this is a big one. I'm fairly upset with how the documentary handles the departure of Terry Farrell from the show. They play it off as her having a disagreement with ""a producer."" Well, okay the circumstances are fairly well known: she was treated like shit by Rick Berman. Even 20 years later, she's on the verge of tears recounting a very redacted version of her story. I was on the verge of tears seeing her like this. In a post-#MeToo world, this isn't good enough. Not that Berman is in the same league as Weinstein, but giving Berman a pass and not taking him to task for his horrible mistreatment of Farrell is just fucking cowardly. I can't believe Berman appeared in this documentary! What the hell! Imagine if there was a documentary about stand-up comedy where some female comedians talk about sexual harassment in the industry without naming names and you have Louis C.K. in it like nothing happened.

Closing thoughts:

Despite the issues I had with it, I had a huge smile on my face during most of the film. I absolutely adore these people and seeing them together one more time was just wonderful. However, I am the exact person this documentary is meant for. Did I like it? Unequivocally yes. Was this a good documentary? Maybe? I'm not sure?

All I can say with certainty is that if you love DS9, it's a great companion piece to the series. However I'm not sure it's worth watching if you're not already familiar with the show.",startrek,1565279143,arctic_ninja,15,9,True,2019-08-08

2159,I started watching the new Star Trek series and I'm very disappointed in the emphasis on action.,"So my wife and I recently started watching the new Star Trek series ""The Next Generation,"" and we're struggling to continue. It's just NOT the Star Trek I know and love and expect. There's just so much action, it's like they were trying to pander to modern audiences craving cheap Hollywood entertainment. We just finished ""The Arsenal of Freedom,"" which is nothing but an excuse for the characters to get into some action scenes with their phasers. Before that, there was an episode where 3 Klingons are rescued by the Enterprise and there's some story and background and probably character development for Worf, but to be honest, I stopped paying attention after the Enterprise security team had a fight with the 2 surviving warriors. Even an episode that could've been great and explored some interesting philosophy, where Riker is given the powers of Q, just turned into an action-fest with the weird animal-like French soldiers shooting photon muskets at the crew. There's an episode **literally** called ""The Battle"" which was absolutely nothing more than an excuse to have Picard engage in a starship duel against the Enterprise (okay, I'll admit that was fricken sweet but still, I want something more philosophy-oriented).

Sorry for the rant. There's just a lot of dumb action. I've tuned out a long time now, I'm just watching it because my wife still likes it, but what does she know? This new Trek is just pitiful. Netflix should know better.",startrek,1565287223,orionsbelt05,221,137,True,2019-08-08

([cool article about BBSs, if you're interesting in early internet stuff](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/))  Even though I was pretty young at the time and didn't get a lot of the jokes, the memory of it remained in the back of my brain and upon recently remembering it I looked it up, and also noticed that it hadn't been posted here.  Anyway, hope somebody else gets a kick out of these!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Why did the chicken cross the road?**  
&gt;  
&gt; Captain James T. Kirk : To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chakotay: Whatever its reason, whatever its goals, we should respect its right to cross the road and seek its own spiritual awareness.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neelix: Actually, Captain, I'm not really familiar with the chickens in this system. But, if you can catch it, I can cook it.  
&gt;  
&gt;HoloDoc: How should I know? No one tells me anything around here. I didn't even know we added chickens to the crew. All I know is that it would have been nice, BEFORE the chicken went off to the cross the road, if it had remembered to turn me off!  
&gt;  
&gt;B'Elanna: I'm sure it felt suffocated by all the bleeping regulations of bleeping Starfleet and just couldn't stand it any longer!  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Well, I think that...say, that's a lovely shirt you're wearing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Harry: I don't know, it's my first mission.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tuvok: That's not a question we'd prefer to hear from a senior officer. It makes the junior officers nervous.  
&gt;  
&gt;Janeway: Its primary goal was no doubt to get back to the Alpha Quadrant...and it probably misses its dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kes: It was remembering back to the times when its ancestors crossed roads all the time! They lost those abilities because they stopped using them!  
&gt;  
&gt;Odo: I don't have the slightest idea--and I don't particularly care...but then, I've never understood ornithoids' need to engage in such pointless behavior.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quark: Now really, why would I have bribed him to do it so I could make a  tidy profit in the station pool? Besides, all I know is that chicken tastes just like tube grubs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kira: It was probably being chased by those damn Cardassians!  
&gt;  
&gt;The Grand Nagus: Stupid chicken! You don't cross the road all at once!  You sneak across it quietly, without anyone noticing! (Inconceivable!)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gul Dukat: Well, that's a very interesting question...I'm sure we can work out some kind of arrangement to obtain that information that will  be to everyone's satisfaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sisko: I don't care -why- it was crossing the road! All I want to know is -why- it left the coop! So it wanted to ""get to the other side""--there is only -so far- that my tolerance will go!  
&gt;  
&gt;O'Brien: No problem, Commander, I'll get right on it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Bashir: Who am I to argue with a chicken?  
&gt;  
&gt;Dax: To get to the other side. Kurzon might have disagreed with me, Tobin I'm sure wouldn't have had a clue, and then there's...  
&gt;  
&gt;Garak: To get to the other side? Of course not! Do you realize how ridiculous that is? I'm sure it was a simple matter of its farmer expelling it from the coop for...embezzling eggs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worf: I don't know. KLINGON chickens do NOT cross roads.  
&gt;  
&gt;Riker: I don't know why, but I know how: with pleasure, sir.  
&gt;  
&gt;Troi: It was running...running away from...no, escaping...oh, Captain, it was fleeing from such -pain-!  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Crusher: If there's nothing wrong with the chicken, there must be something wrong with the universe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tasha: That depends...was it fully functional?  
&gt;  
&gt;Wesley: I'm not sure, but I can figure it out if I reroute these systems  and reconfigure the warp field and run a complete internal  whootchacallit on the computers and...  
&gt;  
&gt;Barclay: Uh, chicken?!! Where?!!! C-c-c-ommander, did I ever mention my problem with small feathered things?  
&gt;  
&gt;Geordi: Well, wherever it's going, I'm sure it'll be there in an hour or two--but any later, and it'll be absolutely impossible for it to make it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Data: The chicken, in observing that it was on the opposite side of the 20th century Terran paved roadway, was aware that its immediate goal should have been to traverse the distance without interception by any kind of combustion-propelled personal transport vehicle, but I am unclear as to why any kind of domesticated fowl should desire to perambulate upon a conveyance normally reserved for the usage of...yes,  sir.  
&gt;  
&gt;Picard: There are four lights!  
&gt;  
&gt;The Borg: Crossing the road is irrelevant. The chicken will be assimilated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hugh the Borg: Is it my friend?  
&gt;  
&gt;Kirk: You chicken bastard, you killed my son...YOU chicken BASTARD, you  killed...my SON...you CHICKEN bastard....youkilledmy...son!

2166,Help a writer out?,"So in my free time, I’ve been playing around with a little short story set in the Star Trek online verse. It follows a squad of MACO Federation special forces. So far, I’ve had a lot of fun designing new “experimental” equipment for each team. Body armor with light shields and cloaking tech, transporter “missiles”, converting a type 11 shuttle into a covert drop ship. All fun little thought experiments. Letting your imagination run wild with the possibilities.

However, there’s One piece of technology that I’m sort of struggling with: the tricorder. We have a medical version and an engineering version, but I’ve been trying to imagine what a security variant would be like. A “combat tricorder”.

Tricorders are meant to be the Swiss Army knife of hand held devices. But so far, I’m struggling to come up with interesting functions to set this thing apart.

All I’ve got is a Motion detector (similar to those seen in the alien franchise) and a detachable “skeleton key” module that could be used for forcing access to hostile computer systems.

Could be I’m just a little burnt out at the moment. But I thought I’d reach out to the community to help flesh out this idea a bit more.

I love The Next Generation, and all Star Trek. Truly. TNG might even be my favorite! But, I can't seem to get over Wesley. I literally skip episodes when they hint that they will focus on him i.e. the ones where he has a crush, gets Starfleet exams, etc. The idea of a 16yo do-gooder being on the bridge, coming up with great solutions and everyone accepting his presence as totally normal just throws a huge wrench into the (hopefully) realistic fantasy of a morally advanced human race and greatly diminishes my enjoyment of this series.

2196,I finished Season 1 of ENT for the first time,"Having watched TOS so many times I’ve lost count, and the same for TNG, I began to lose watching the show when TNG ended. It was, in part, due to the timing of things. I watched TOS a lot because for the first 16 years of my life, that’s the only Trek that was. Then TNG premiered when I was still in high school, and I watched it all through college. Then DS9 came out, and I lost interest. I didn’t care much for VOY, and I only watched a handful of ENT episodes in 2001.

Flash forward to DISCO. It has rekindled my relationship with Trek. Last year, I made it a point to watch all of Voyager. This year, I decided to tackle ENT before finishing up with DS9.

So, I’ve watched all of S1 of ENT, and I like to think it wasn’t too bad. Overall, the good and the bad:

-	Archer is at best a seemingly okay captain. I haven’t seen anything yet that would make him part of the pantheon of captains yet, but he’s also not terrible. I did get tired of the “gosh, darn, we are new to space traveling” kind of approach to things, but I also get Enterprise makes history with every light year. 
-	T’Pol. I have read and heard in various podcasts that ENT really messed up the Vulcans, but I rather disagree with that opinion. I like to think that as Earth and Vulcan are unlikely allies because Earth helps temper the Vulcan superiority complex. I like T’Pol, and I’m glad to have seen some of the Vulcan stories.
-	Phlox. What a gem it is to have John Billingsley on this show. He gives Phlox a truly alien perspective on things. At first, I’d thought I’d dislike him for his “optimism, Captain” line in S1E1, but I could not have been more wrong.
-	Trip. McCoy is by far my #1 character in all Trek in both timelines. But it is so good to hear another Southerner on Star Trek. The relationship between T’Pol and Tucker will be one I hope they develop further.
-	And the rest. I’m glad they quickly toned down Hoshi’s reluctance about deep space missions and to have a comms officer who does more than simply open hailing frequencies. Mayweather and Reed I’m fairly ambivalent about.
-	the Enterprise itself. It’s a nice looking ship. The engine room is nicely done as is the bridge. I like the subtle things like the mess hall, the captain’s mess, and the lack of conference rooms. And no red alerts yet. I found that interesting too.

The temporal cold war is a disappointment. Did the first show have to be about Klingons? The same with DISCO. It would be okay to have them around, but to focus so much early efforts on them. But it was good to see Andorians in ENT. They will seem to be a nice foil to the Vulcans. It will be interesting to see how the Federation forms.

And yes, I am aware of the final episode of Enterprise. After all these years, it was impossible to not know about it. I also knew the final episode of Voyager was bad too, but I won’t let that stop me from enjoying the rest of the series.",startrek,1561908969,IntrovertIdentity,11,9,True,2019-06-30

Let’s consider a few things.  As of the end of season two, we now have, in the same place and time:

* A ship that can jump instantly to any point in the known universe as well as between dimensions, carrying a massive 100,000-year-old tech database.

* A time-travel suit.

* A sentient-life-destroying AI that has already figured out a way to assimilate.humans and is in a quest for technology that allows it to evolve.

If *any* part of Control survives and somehow made it through that wormhole, or somehow links up with Discovery if/when it and it’s crew return to the “present” time frame, those may be the perfect raw ingredients for the recipe that gives us the Borg...

A time/dimensio/spore-drive-jumping sentient AI with 100,000 years of data already on tap that wants nothing but to acquire new tech in order to better itself?  With all those abilities in hand, the Borg genesis and rise could happen in a *very* short time, relatively-wise, while from the “present” time frame of shows like Discovery/TNG/DS9, it would seem like they’d been at it for millennia.  

This would be so much fun from a writing standpoint: Control———&gt;Borg with all the hiccups and twists along the way.",startrek,1561912943,Spock_Nipples,16,0,True,2019-06-30

2201,What are your most controversial Star Trek opinions?,"What opinion(s) you have about Star Trek (any iteration) that you think are controversial and generally not shared by most of the fandom? 

I suppose I'll start, with a couple of my own (both regarding TNG): 

1) I think Pulaski was a better as the doctor character than Crusher. I like Crusher (and Gates McFadden), but I always thought that Pulaski fit better with the rest of the crew, especially with her possibility for ""conflict.""  This was, of course, unacceptable by Roddenberry's standards, so Pulaski didn't have that much of a chance to develop in season 2. However, I think that had she stayed longer, she would have become a wonderful character. At the very least, I wish they had brought her back once or twice during the series. 

2) I think TNG greatly benefited from Denise Crosby's departure at the end of season 1. I say specifically Denise Crosby and not Tasha Yar, because it's her acting that I found objectionable. I don't want to make a general case about Crosby's acting talent (she might be wonderful in everything else), but her performance in Star Trek left a lot to be desired for me. Even when she comes back as a guest star in later seasons, she is disappointing, imo. 

Interested to hear some other opinions out there.

All of their fury, and rage is unleashed into this weapon. The war between the Borg, and the Ozor is known as the eternal war as there seems to be no end. 

However the Ozor got a awakening. When this new leader got on the throne, all of the Ozor's psionic abilities were drastically increased. Some theorize that the Q had a hand, others believe through constant warfare, their brains evolved.

After that, the Borg was losing battle after battle after battle. The Ozor's psionic abilities disrupted the collective, caused the Borg to fight each other.

Because it's just one episode, I wouldn't pick an episode that's heavily entrenched in the bigger arc of the season or whatever.  

I know what I'd do for half the series, but not TOS, Voyager, or Enterprise:

TOS: ?

TNG: Darmok  (Cause and Effect is a close second, but there are more plot holes, I feel; and I'm worried the ending doesn't hold up as well.  Also, Cause and Effect feels like it'll overlap too much with my pick for Discovery...)

DS9: The Visitor (this one's easy for me) 

VOY: ?

ENT: ?

DSC: Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad (I feel this one does the best as a standalone episode while providing a fun and classic, if not entirely original anymore, sci fi premise)


But yeah.  I'm struggling with the others.  I'm struggling with TOS because while I enjoy it, I don't know which ones would hold up best for modern audiences.  I'm struggling with Voyager because a lot of that show's best episodes are two-parters, or require a lot more knowledge of the characters and lore.

Since that, I have also caught up with all Star Trek movies, including those in the Kelvin timeline.

2256,A question about Klingon Warrior ideology?,"I apologize in advance if this seems like an obvious answer question but I originally figured a sub reddit about TlhInganpu' (a beginner in learning TlhIngan Hol as well) would be one of the better places to start because and to quote Curzon Dax ""At the end of the day, the only people who can truly handle the Klingons, are the Klingons."" So I first posted this in r/tlhInganHol But I took notice of something just now while slightly intoxicated (another apology if I sound sloppy, long winded, or like I'm sporadically jumping around in my explanation. I hope I don't bore :/) rewatching Next Gen.

If it is okay with you the reader, and once again my apologies in advanced, I would like to provide what I think may be the answer before I ask the question.
A. Much like Goku going to the moon in the earlier episodes of Dragon Ball to drop off that rabbit and his goons and then later on in DBZ you find out his species turns into great apes when they focus on the moon for an extended amount of time - they hadn't developed the ""culture"" or ""species"" enough just yet
B. There is something that is in the books, whether they are written by Marc Okrand or not, that reveals this answer.
C. Q is going off of an archaic (Much like how he first appeared in ""outdated"" uniforms and knowledge of tera'nganpu' and DIvI Hol at first) or out dated school of TlhIngan thought so he just Dayajbe'? (Doesn't understand? [Was that correct? Sorry self taught for the most part]) - side thought: maybe The Q aren't as omnipotent as we thought and they eeds to be in front or around something to gain knowledge about whatever it is (essentially he doesn't know a thing until he becomes or surrounds himself with that thing)
D. Like the ridged and unridged TlhIngan it is explained in other Star Trek series ie DS9 and Enterprise.
E. It's okay if it's Klingons but not if it's another species.
F. I'm just intoxicated and it's not even worth mentioning.

So what happened was, I was watching Next Gen (S1E9 Hide And Q) and it gets to the lemonade scene, where the plain just seemed to produce whatever drink the individual liked and Q says ""Drink not with thine enemy. A rigid TlhIngan code.""
And yet later on in Next Gen (S5E1 Redemption Part 2) Kern and Word are both at a TlhIngan bar drinking with what is essentially their enemies. Kern makes a it a point to say that ""Here we are all TlhInganpu'."" So I guess what my question is, which one is correct?

2259,The wormhole aliens used sisko,It always annoyed me how the wormhole aliens (I refuse to call them prophets.  They're aliens that live in a wormhole that can see the future) used sisko like a pawn in a chess game.  And how over time he put up with it more and more.  The only good thing they ever did for anyone was stopping the dominion from coming through the wormhole.  Even then sisko had to talk them into it and it had a price tag attached.  As for the pah wraiths well they never really were that much of a problem.  At least not one that flooding the fire caves with chronitons wouldn't solve.  Sisko obviously knew the pah wraiths were back.  But instead of just flooding the whole area with chronitons from orbit he went down there and confronted dukat face to face.  Not very smart.  Had I been in sisko's shoes I would have told the wormhole aliens to go to hell and not to contact me in visions anymore.  And if I thought the pah wraiths were going to be a problem I would flood the entire surface of bajor with chronitons.  then all you would have to worry about is the dominion.  No more being a religious icon.  Instead though the wormhole aliens played sisko like a puppet on a string.  And because they can see the future they're really good at manipulating him.  But it's his fault he went along with it.  So what do you think.  Was sisko a puppet of the wormhole aliens.,startrek,1562069126,WaveMonkey,136,38,True,2019-07-02

2267,Star Trek novel discussion!,"I had an idea a few days ago while I was on a work trip that I haven't seen many book discussions here, so I'd start one! I've been reading the ST books since the mid 80s, and have read literally well over a hundred of them. I'll bring up a just a few of my favorites here, and you should too!

**""The Wounded Sky"" by Diane Duane** This was a trippy book examining the role of thought on reality. Using an experimental drive technology they try to travel to the Magellanic Clouds, but tear a hole in the universe to another where thought is just as powerful as physical phenomenon. In the end they have to use thought to help repair the damage and return home. Sound familiar? This 1983 novel went on to inform the TNG episode ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" which was very, very similar.

**""My Enemy, My Ally"" and ""The Romulan Way"" by Diane Duane** Too much to unpack here, but basically we get to learn a lot about the history of the Romulans.

**""Cold Equations"" trilogy by David Mack** David Mack is one of my favorite Trek authors, and this is a fantastic set of books. We get to explore Data's resurrection, as well as exploring more about Lal, Juliana Tainer, Dr Soong, and an entire sub-civilization of androids.

**""Metamorphosis"" by Jean Lorrah** A longer novel that mostly focuses on Data, what seems to be his destiny to become human, and the repercussions of that. The ending of the book was quite dramatic to me, and had a lingering effect. It's not really even contradictory of TV-canon in how it wraps up.

**""Vendetta"" by Peter David** Peter David is another amazing Trek author. A young woman from a race that was assimilated by the Borg unleashes another Planet Killer (from ""The Doomsday Machine"" in TOS), we deal more with Guinan, and we get our first explicitly female Borg. Side note, there was a disclaimer on the book that it was non-canon because Richard Arnold, the Star trek Archivist at the time, somehow had vetting authority and decided that there were no Borg females despite there being Borg BABIES.",startrek,1562092943,burnte,10,7,True,2019-07-02

2277,Discovery is an insult to star trek.,"Not much of a trekkie yet but slowly becoming one. 
So I watched discovery before next gen, on and off . I live with my girlfriend, she likes star trek, I would play games on my laptop and half watch it while she was actually watching it on our TV. 
Normally to mock how shit the writing was.
Half way through season 3 on next gen however, just got done with the episode based around Data and Lal. Discovery never offered anything close to this. I half watched discovery and mocked it when it grabbed my attention because of how bad it was being. 
Next gen is so good , it's forced me to stop playing and pay attention.
I've actually found myself extremely surprised and impressed with how deep and philosophical next gen has gotten. 
Given that next gen came out thirty years ago , I have no idea how or why discovery ended up being so bland, soulless and frankly insulting to the viewers intelligence. 

Next gen questioned you. You'll find yourself asking how you'd deal with current moral conundrum the next gen gang are dealing with. 
Picard has a damn golden tongue though so he normally says what I'm thinking in a much more eloquent way. If I wasn't thinking it though, I'm learning from what he says. This show is truly brilliant. 
Given the example set, I have no idea how discovery ended up being so dreadful. 
They're too busy shoving politics down your throat. 
Or being focused on how whiny but apparently bad ass Micheal is.
Rather than offering something truly human, philosophical and diverse. 

I honestly can't help but see discovery as not only a bad star trek series but a literal insult to star trek in general and what it stands for. 

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you as fans can convince me. Maybe in time, after viewing the rest of what star trek has to offer I'll convince myself.

Was pleased to see that some thoughtful soul has updated Wikipedia's DS9 page with a good summary of 'S08E01', which might interest anybody here who hasn't seen the DS9 doco yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

*As part of the Deep Space 9 documentary What We Left Behind , show-runner Ira Steven Behr gathered together DS9 ‘writers room’ alumni Ronald D. Moore, Hans Beimler and Robert Hewitt Wolfe to map out the opening episode for a proposed eighth season, assuming that this new season was set some 20 years after the series finale (ie, written in the same ‘real-time’ as when the documentary was made).*

*The proposed episode would seen Nog, now captain of a Starfleet vessel, killed when his ship is destroyed while fleeing attack from a cloaked ship of unknown origin.*

*Kira Nerys is now in command of Deep Space 9 but is also a Vedek in the Bajoran religion, while Quark still runs his bar at The Promenade. Also working on DS9 as a science officer is Joseph Sisko, Commander Sisko’s son by Kasidy Yates.*

*Most of the remaining cast from the final episode of DS9 journey back to the station. This includes*

* *Miles O’Brien, who is now teaching engineering at Earth’s Starfleet Academy, and still married to Keiko; their daughter Molly is a Starfleet officer assigned to DS9*
* *Ezri Dax, who commands the USS Emmett Till, where her now-husband Julian Bashir also serves as medical officer*
* *Worf, who is soon to be appointed Chancellor of the Klingon Empire given the ill health of Chancellor Martok*
* *Jake Sisko, now a novelist living above the family restaurant in New Orleans*

*They meet in the holodeck, at the 1960s Las Vegas lounge of Vic Fontaine, and determine to investigate Nog’s death. While the writers originally suggested that Odo return to DS9 at Kira's request to help with the investigation, Behr decided it would be better dramatically to hold Odo back for the second episode of the proposed season.*

*Worf secretly meets Garak in the caves below Bajor, where Garak reveals that Kira has converted a squad of Jem Hadar warriors to the Bajoran religion and intends them to become a new Bajoran militia.*

*The writers share with viewers that the cloaked ship which chased, attacked and destroyed Nog’s vessel belonged to Section 31, which believes the Bajoran religion is the major impediment to Bajor joining the Federation – and has therefore decided to wipe out the Bajoran religion by destroying the holy Orbs and the wormhole itself. Nog had discovered Section 31's plans.*

*The episode culminates in an armed standoff between DS9 officers and members of the original crew, at which point a bright light appears not only on the Promenade at DS9 but also on the bridge of Worf’s Klingon ship and DS9’s Commanders Office, where Jake is sitting – the light then coalesces into Benjamin Sisko, and on screen appears the text ‘To be continued…’*

*Behr says that viewers can use their imagine to decide what happened next.*

2310,Sometimes I almost wonder how TNG era Klingons get anything done.,"I'm watching an episode of Deep Space Nine. The one where Quark temporarily takes over a Klingon house and when he asks to look at the house's financial records Grilka retorts ""We are Klingon warriors. We do not dirty ourselves with filthy ledgers."" 

And yet apparently somehow the filthy ledgers have been maintained because Quark is able to review them and spot what another Klingon is trying to do to his house. 

Klingons seem to respect only one thing and that's warriors. They seem to look down on everything else. They seem to especially look down on accountants, yet I guess some Klingon out there dirties himself with ledgers. You'd think Klingons would be grateful to the people who manage their spoils.

We see one instance of a Klingon scientist if I recall in TNG, she's (I think it was a she) is not very well regarded. You'd think the Klingons would be grateful to the people developing their defenses and weapons. 

There are two instances of Klingon attorneys, one played by Michael Dorn in Star Trek 6 and the other on Deep Space Nine. They seemed to have no shame about what they did but the latter attorney tried to treat the legal process like a metaphorical battle because again, only warriors are respected. 

And even in the military Klingons don't usually fight their battles with Bat'leths hand to hand but sitting behind consoles on starships. Not the most physically exerting or warrior-like activity, one wonders how Klingons tolerate it. In fact only one Klingon warrior gets to target the weapons, I'll bet there's a lot of fighting over that job. ""No I want to shoot the weapons"" ""No fair you got to shoot the weapons last time"" ""Alright Kern you shoot the phasers, Ghor you get the photon torpedos."" ""Yay"" 

I guess my point is, while we do see some evidence of Klingons holding other occupations they overwhelmingly value the occupation of warrior and we overwhelmingly see Klingon warriors (I know its because we're seeing a lot of military situations but still considering the culture . . . ). They clearly take a dim view of other professions, its a wonder their society functions.",startrek,1562240600,FreshContact,68,67,True,2019-07-04

2312,A retrospective on later TNG seasons,"I've recently finished rewatching TNG and decided to watch through DS9 (which I love!)

I don't know how many people will agree, but on finishing TNG, I got the feeling it was stopping before its time. Now I know seasons 6 and 7 were relatively poor, but I think this was due to Rick Berman and the writing staff giving their best material and time to DS9 by this point (and beginning pre-production on Voyager).

In my opinion, later TNG suffered mostly due to negligence and over-stretching of resources to new Star Trek projects. Had they dedicated more to TNG, I really think it could've continued into at least season 10. There were still a lot of stories to tell and material to explore.",startrek,1562243354,Scotty_C_89,8,9,True,2019-07-04

First off, a quote from Spock:

The many here refers to Tuvok and Neelix, and the few or the one refers to Tuvix. 

What right does Janeway have to usurp the rights of Tuvok and Neelix to live, who, by the way, had no say on the matter due to be fused with Tuvix, and because Tuvix is one individual, his rights cannot outweigh the rights of two individuals.

Also, on the emotional standpoint, a lot of people criticize Janeway's decision here, but I ask you, if you had been in her shoes, are you sure you wouldn't have done the same?

Remember, Tuvok and Neelix are like family to her, if it was your brother and sister that was fused into one person, you wouldn't sacrifice the life of that one individual to save the life of your two siblings?",startrek,1562295099,RagglenLove,40,2,True,2019-07-04

2333,How to write a Star Trek Discovery Episode: A List of Satirical Guidelines,"Warning: This is a satirical list of guidelines for aspiring STD writers. This list pokes fun at some of the conventions which I've noticed in the writing of the episodes of Season 1 and 2. Feel free to add more in the comments:)

1) The plot must revolve around Burnham. If she is not the center of attention, she still has to do something significant which impacts the entire narrative (solve a problem, start a war with the Klingons, end a war with the Klingons, use a time travel suit to save the universe from Control, etc.)

2) The plot must thematize an emotional conflict for Burnham, preferably caused by her relationship to family members (Sarek, Amanda, Spock), friends (Georgiou, Saru) or love interests (Tyler). Scenes that include crying / weeping / sobbing are recommended.

3) Tilly has to annoy everyone by talking without pause, especially in awkward moments.

4) Georgiou must appear to help out Michael.

5) If an enemy species is needed in the episode, stick to Klingons.

6) Don't care too much about the canon in how you depict technologies. Advanced technologies (holotechnology, faster-than-warp spore drive, etc.) can be used, irrespective of how other Star Trek series present them as something new in the 24th century.",startrek,1562318989,MSRNSKA,211,183,True,2019-07-05

2335,My peeves in the J.J.Abrams Star Trek Movies,"I'm sure everyone has felt the same on these topics but I wanted to express my opinions on the many discrepancies in J.J.Abrams Star Trek Movies.

&amp;#x200B;

1: When the USS Kelvin was attacked my Nero's ship Captain Richard Robau headed for the shuttle bay which was suspended above the ship, yet the captain is seen exiting the turbo-lift after going ""down"" towards the warp nacelle. The turbo-lift and shuttle bay can't have been inverted since we see the shuttles exiting the bay in the same orientation as the ship.

&amp;#x200B;

2: The internal space of a starship must be miniaturized if the Enterprise could house a factory sized engineering compartment and shuttle bay in the same star-drive section with room to spare for all those torpedo launchers and water turbines. And we can't forget that the warp core in Into Darkness is 3 stories high.

&amp;#x200B;

3: When the Enterprise arrives at Vulcan into that giant debris field Captain Pike orders power to be rerouted from ""Port Nacelles"" to forward shields. In Into Darkness Khan says ""life support system located behind the aft nacelles"". Did the screen writers forget the Enterprise has only 2 nacelles and both a affixed to the ship's aft section?

&amp;#x200B;

4: This is one of my biggest peeves about all three movies and it's the concept of ""Shields"". Shields (to my knowledge) are a barrier between a starship hull and the surrounding space that prevent weapons and other objects from impacting the hull. So where were the shields when weapons ripped apart the hulls of the Kelvin and Enterprise? And it can't be because ships were fighting more powerful vessels because Krall's swarm ships were able to pass through the active shields and breech the hull.

&amp;#x200B;

2363,"TOS, season 2 episode 3 (on Netflix) “journey to babel”","Enterprise to Starfleet command,

I posted the other day abt how i just started watching TOS for the first time. A bunch of people asked me what my favorite episode was so far and i had no answer! I just finished “journey to Babel” and it is by far my favorite episode. 

The plot: picking up ambassadors to determine whether a specific planet should be allowed in the federation, all the while there is a plot to undermine the negotiations, the enterprise has a spy on board and is being followed by an unknown alien ship, at the same time sarek, Spock’s father, has a heart condition that must be corrected. 

I literally laughed my ass off more than once during this episode. 

At one point, the enterprise was under attack, and all the ambassadors were wondering what was happening, Kirk tells Uhura, “well... tell them to... TAKE A GOOD GUESS!”

2366,Oh the Irony....,"So recently rewatching various trek series and came across something interesting.

TNG Season 6 ep 20: “The Chase” the one with the ancient humanoids who after discovering that they were alone, seeded genetic material across the galaxy, along with a message. The episode consists of Enterprise crew tracking down the various DNA sequences from different planets to assemble the message, along the way joined by Klingons, Cardassians, and eventually Romulans. 

In the end they all witness the message and the Klingons and Cardassians scoff in disbelief and leave disgusted. 

The final scenes show Picard wishing that the message hadn’t fallen on deaf ears only to later be hailed by the Romulan captain who after begrudgingly accepting the truth of the message tells Picard that perhaps they have more in common than it first appeared, and tells him that perhaps someday they could be allies.

A fairly standard TNG one off episode, with the standard hope-for-the-future ending we’ve come to expect of Star Trek.

The irony comes in when you realize that the ancient humanoid projection is played by none other than actress Salome Jens, who DS9 fans will recognize as the female Changling who is the main representative of the founders and the Dominion. 

Which means that the 4 major alpha (and beta) quadrant powers who witnessed the message and scoffed were in the end united against the Dominion which was mostly lead by the same person!",startrek,1562469699,wstacey,11,14,True,2019-07-06

I suppose there's the possibility where there would likely be more than 1 offspring per birth, but that didn't seem like the case when they were on that Ocampa planet at the beginning of the show, nor was there a disproportional number of male to female ratio... (one male, multiple females)

Next Gen is what I watch when I’m tired from work and ready to go to sleep. It’s perfect because the show is relatively calm and each episode was familiar enough that I felt “cozy” watching it, in addition to my being genuinely invested in the setting and writing.

2373,Recurring characters mainly the baddies,"So I guess DS9 and VOY ""spoilers"" for anyone wstill watching or yet to watch. Yeah both shows arent exactly recent, but you know. 

Ok so I saw a post in Daystrom about about how changelings on DS9 could not only imitate the look but also the personality of those they are replacing. An example was when Bashir was replaced and it was shown that the changeling had replaced him for a few episodes based on the fact a uniform change had taken place. I comnented that I wondered if it had been planned or a last minute decision from the writers. 

Another redditor pointed out a previous story where it was changeling Bashir in the story where Odo was caring for a changeling infant, ""changeling Bashir"" didnt seem too fussed about a changeling infant dying. So that lead me to believe that it must have been a last minute thing to reveal changeling Bashir. 

I mean thats fair enough, writers cant think of everything, and at the time it was uncommon for a tv series to plot out the entire seasons direction. 

But then if you look at Voyager, we have Seska, eventually Seska was revealed to be a Cardassian disguised as a Bajoran, and a traitor.

Then the Klingons appear in Discovery again but way less looking Human than in TNG and DS9.

So if you watch on the time line that means they changed from very Human to absolutly not Human and than back to slightly Human.

Thought I would share,"The real problem with Star Trek Discovery, and the reason it breaks  canon and shouldn't be considered Star Trek, is that no one in the real  Star Treks constantly talks about the events of Star Trek:Discovery. A  show that wouldn't be conceived of for another 20+ years. It's so  unrealistic! I mean, personally, I am always talking about things that  happened 106 years ago. That's just how real humans talk, and if the hack writers of Fake Trek Discovery knew anything about good dialogue,  they'd know this. I never talk about things that are happening around  me now in 2019. That would be ridiculous. My primary concern and the  exclusive subject of my conversation is things that happened in 1913.

How come no one mentions the Crossfield class starship in TNG!? I never  get into a car without waxing lyrical about the Morris Oxford  Bullnose, introduced in 1913.

People come up to me to say 'Hi'  and I ask what their opinions are on the deposition of King Otto of  Bavaria by his cousin Ludwig? And they of course know what I'm talking  about because they, like me, are well versed in the events of 1913.

I walked past two people talking about the Democratic Presidential debates and I almost punched them, but instead I settled for screming in their faces about how they could waste precious breath on things that are happening now and could impact their lives when the 1913 creation of the Federal Reserve System by Woodrow WIlson in 1913 was being neglected?

I asked one of my friends why he was so down? Was it becasue Crete, having achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire, was annexed by Greece? He said it was because his boyfriend had dumped him and I told him that unless his boyfriend broke it off 106 years ago I didn't care. I also called him out for forcing diversity on me by being gay.

2400,I watched Nemesis and would do it again,"Join me as I figure this one out!

To recap my impressions:

**Generations** is a total mess, there's too much going on yet it's underwhelming. The ship is the same, the people are the same, yet everything seems wrong. My least favourite trek movie.

**First Contact** is fun as hell, I liked it more than I expected to, pretty great, well-paced action with horror elements. Yes, Picard is angry, vengeful Picard, but PatStew is wonderful, and yadda yadda, you know this movie rocks.

**Insurrection** is boring as hell and I didn't find it funny. The story is very similar to Journey's End, which, although
not a particularly great episode, in my opinion was a tighter and more compelling story and more interesting in set/costume 
design (ain't nobody winning an oscar for browns and beige) and otherwise better executed than this entire movie.

And now, the conclusion..

I inexplicably enjoyed Nemesis and felt it a satisfying enough conclusion to the TNG movies. It is not quite so easy for me to point out exactly why I enjoyed it the way I did. Not as much as First Contact, heck no, but enough to write this post. I thought it was a gripping action adventure that also dealt with themes of death, nature versus nurture, and had a cool visual style and a great soundtrack.

Yet it is despised.

Nemesis, I think, aimed to please. It had Picard facing his own ""Khan"", when he already did just that in First Contact. It had a nebula battle with limited communications and harder combat, even though this had been done already in a better movie. It had Data facing an android who looks just like him but is different, which had been done better in a six-year-long arc in the show. It had Worf back at tactical without explaining why, and no one is expected to care why.

But even if those things landed, how could it please? The director knew nothing about trek. The producers gave in to PStew's desire to have a fun off-roading scene, and to Brent Spiner's desire to have his character die. It features the Troi mind-rape trope nobody likes and Picard uncharacteristically coldly dismissing the occurrence. The tone is moody, dark, sad, completely different from the uplifting open ending of the show (or The Undiscovered Country, for that matter).

I suppose my problem is that I liked that. I liked that it ends bitter-sweet while still giving characters a send-off. I liked Picard and Data facing themselves-but-not-themselves. I liked the snappy, plot-driven dialogue of some scenes, better than the very same thing in the next three movies, that's for sure, since these characters had time to develop. And I say that, aware that the development of characters and of relationships is utilized in some instances, and ignored in others.

Shinzon's motivation to attack Earth is weak, but this is a younger Picard whose life experience had been nothing but suffering, so he's making these chaotic, destructive choices and is constantly angry and just wants to conquer everything and believes both Picards can't live so Picard must die too. Not particularly multiple-dimensional, I agree, but hardly worse than half of the other trek movie villains.

Especially knowing that Picard's story does not end there (even though I have some concerns about the upcoming show), I found the this a satisfying conclusion for this cast. Yes, All Good Things is better, but, regarding Nemesis, I would rather have it than not have it, and that is the bottom line, I suppose.

1.  After best of both worlds, Picard should never have been allowed anywhere near a starship again, let alone reinstated in command of the flagship.  

Irregardless of the fact that it wasn't necessarily his fault, he led the massacre of thousands of Starfleet crew and officers.  Finding Starfleet crew who were NOT directly impacted by his actions would be challenging.  (See: Sisko).

Add in the fact that there's no way to be 100% certain that he wasn't going to turn out to be some sort of sleeper agent, you have basically crippled the enterprise from anything involving the Borg.

Furthermore, his mental health was STILL being impacted and the events were clouding his judgement during the events of First Contact 7 years later.

Finally, Riker, who more or less led the assault and saved the federation gets DEMOTED afterwards.  Even if he wanted to stay as first officer on the enterprise, there is precident for someone with the rank of captain serving as first officer (Kirk Spock Scotty and Sulu were all captains by the end of the movies).


2.  The enterprise D separating into two sections for combat purposes is cool as shit.

2403,I really like Ezri Dax,"Ezri gets a lot of hate from fans. I went into DS9 expecting to hate her but instead I have a lot of affection for her.  I was really disappointed when Jadzia got murdered, especially when I found out it was bc Rick Berman didn't want to accommodate Terry Farrell's wish to be in less episodes for scheduling reasons when he accommodated for Colm Meaney's schedule. But it's not Ezri's fault and it seems a lot of people dislike her for not living up to Jadzia instead of looking at her as her own character. Trill politics really interest me and getting a character with a symbiot but no training or wish for one was really exciting. I especially liked the episode she had to deal with her family as a person who was no longer Ezri Tigan and I wish they'd put more stuff like that in. I also loved that she had a completely different relationship with the Joran side of Dax than Jadzia. The only thing I really hated was the forced relationship with Julian. Ezri's identity change and self realization would have been a great allegory for being LGBT and putting her in a romance with Julian after his arc of accepting Jadzia as a close friend made it feel cheap. 

In my experience, people either love Ezri or hate her.

2422,Talaxians were the aggressors?,"Watching the voyager episode 'Jetrel' with a friend and it occurred to us that in the Talaxian/Haakonian war, it may have been Talaxians that were the initial aggressors and the Haakonians only deployed the metrion cascade as a last ditch effort to subdue the Talaxians.

Seven of nine mentions in an episode that talaxians made great tactical drones due to their muscle mass, suggesting that Talaxians are naturally strong kinda like klingons.

Neelix is nice enough but seems quick to anger and when he is angry tends to fly off the handle pretty quick, so I wonder if this is a common trait amongst other talaxians. While we do encounter others, while the female Talaxian seems pretty calm, the other give off a pretty stern, somewhat untrusting vibe, although this may just be due to their situation. I'd have to go back and watch the other eps with talaxians. 

For a member of a supposed villainous race, Jetrel seems pretty chill, you'd suspect that if he was from a hostile invasive species he'd not give a crap about his work on the metrion cascade, kinda like how most romulans present a sort of cold arrogance. But Jetrel comes off as nothing but altruistic, and really wants to help the talaxians of rinax. His actions tells of someone who really didn't want to use the weapon but knew there was no choice. 

Voyager goes to rinax which is a moon of haakonian occupide talax itself and there doesn't seem to be any military or security forces, or at least if there is they don't seem to have an issue with voyager being there. If the Haakonians were some horrible oppressive race, you'd think as soon as voyager rocked up they'd have ships there immediately.

Neelix himself admits that the talaxians had conscription which if refused was met with summary execution.

The metrion cascade is a weapon of mass destruction, in that it renders the planet unusable. Why do that if you plan on annexing the planet in question? 

My theory. The talaxians are actually the aggressive war mongering race and the Haakonians used the metrion cascade to bring them in line and occupied their home world to stop them from starting more wars in that area of space. Like they used it to show the talaxians that if they wanted to they could wipe them out, but stopped short when talax surrendered because they just wanted them to stop.

Bonus theory: The aliens trying to get the Talaxian colony off the asteroid were only doing so because talaxians had a reputation and they didn't want them in their space.

2428,Was any reason given why Vulcans and Romulans are so different?,"From what we know in show canon, Vulcan underwent a violent global war around the 15th century which saw nuclear bombardment and advanced weaponry that kills those expressing rage. Then, the teachings of Surak started a cultural revolution which eschewed emotions. Those who rejected the teachings abandoned their home world and settled on various planets such as Debrune before making an empire for themselves from the planet Romulus.


And for some reason over the next thousand years they:
1) started growing foreheads V ridges, though evidently not all have them given the 23rd century military. Were they mostly from the same ethnic minority on Vulcan? Did they mix with another alien race during their refuge? I’ll tell you what it isn’t and that’s multigenerational self harming altering their genes. That’d be stupid. The genetic drift affected their blood too, given Vulcans aren’t a 100% donor match and Worf of all people was.

2) Remain emotionally suppressed but don’t feel the Pon Farr. We’ve seen Vulcan Vulcans express emotions, and they end up just as unstable as their ancient selves, so the Romulans must be emotionally suppressed. Maybe they outlaw depictions of sex so it’s a very private thing (that is, it’s not super private but oh by the way my celebrity priest and fiancé’s crush can watch too).

3) Stopped having telepathic abilities. We know telepathy existed before they left Vulcan, in the form of Katric arcs, and there’s ancient rituals associated with everything that is not of the body. However, the Romulans just never seem to display these abilities, from Mind Melding to telepathy, something Vulcans can do according to one episode of VOY before it was never referenced again. And let’s not forget the ability to feel someone’s presence a lightyear away, something I’m sure Spock did long before ENT and DISCO. Maybe the Romulans are suspicious of psychics and persecuted them so all of their race are stuck on Beginner Mode; their agents on 22nd century Vulcan did seem anxious to stomp out the mind melders.

I found the allegory a little forced, but we are 20 years later and from what I see, not a lot has changed since Ben imagined Benny writing about Ben. So maybe it should be forced. In fact, it’s probably not forced enough. 

I loved Odos character as the antagonist, and Quark (/Herb)s race-ally, standing up for women/race rights. It was absolutely fantastic. 

Made marginally more exciting by the fact that it was directed by Avery Brooks, who was filming Avery Brooks’ Sisko unconsciously dreaming of Avery Brooks’ Benny who was writing stories about Avery Brooks’ Sisko.

2434,Favourite Doppelgangers,"There have been many doppelgangers introduced in various ways over the course of Star Trek. ""Mirror, Mirror"" of the Original Series introduced us to an entire universe of doppelgangers, a universe explored (too) extensively in Deep Space Nine, featured wonderfully in Enterprise and most recently visited by the crew of the Discovery. There were also transporter accidents, clones and other shenanigans that resulted in alternate versions of our heroes. I mentioned a few off the top of my head that I liked and upon further thought, I give you my more thought out list of favourite Star Trek doppelgangers.


Thomas Riker (""Second Chances"" TNG, ""Defiant"" DS9)

I start the list with a classic transporter accident which leaves a copy of Riker stranded on a research station for seven years. The older Riker encounters his double when the Enterprise returns to the research station to upload the stations data during a rare atmospheric window in which the surface is accessible. I really liked the conflict between the young raw and the older, more seasoned and mellow self. The younger Riker was daring and wanted to take all kinds of risks to complete the mission while the older wiser Riker insisted on taking precautions. The copy, known by the end of the episode as Thomas Riker, got a cool sequel in DS9 when he hijacked the Defiant and used it to expose a covert Cardassian ship building facility on behalf of the Maquis. I've always wondered what happened to goatee sporting Thomas.

So, I am a long time fan of Star Trek however, when DS9 was on back in the 90's it was around the time that I was hitting my teens so I had other interests, therefore I ended up missing a lot of episodes. I've been re-watching DS9 in the evenings, last night season 4 ""The Visitor"" was next up. Wow just wow. It hit me, hard, I was completely un-prepared for it. 
I have a young family, my son is 5 and daughter 3, occasionally, sometimes more often than not, I chastise them as if they adults and can lack patience with them. Seeing the relationship of Sisko and Jake had me projecting my relationship with my son. I realised that had it been me in a similar situation, everytime I 'appeared' I felt that I would be focusing on myself, whereas Sisko has no thought to his own predicament he is only interested in his son, how he is, what he is doing. At no point during the episode is he angry or upset or inpatient. Obviously, a relationship in a sci-fi episode set way off into the future is different to our real life world and experience, yet I was moved and have been dwelling on my sometimes impatience with my son. Simply by watching that one episode has completely changed how I'm going to approach certain situations, I want to be more like Benjamin Sisko in my parenting.

So I know Wesley Crusher is a mixed bag - some people like him and some loathe him.

I personally liked his character from the beginning. A gifted lad who managed to avoid Picard's rule about no children on the bridge and went on to become a fully fledged Starfleet ensign and academy student. When he left the main cast, his occasional guest appearances were always nice to see. The warm welcomes and memories of previous episodes were a decent throwback and reminder of how the characters had all developed a true bond.

Then Journey's End comes along, and Wesley decides ""nah, im going to leave Starfleet and be a hippie traveller"". Felt like 7 seasons worth of character development had been flushed away. It just ruined the character for me in some ways.

2453,Does TOS have a Riker's beard moment?,"Hey,

So I've seen all of Trek except TOS, which I'd decided for a long time I'd probably never watch. A few weeks ago there was a post on this sub about it where someone was singing its praises, and in a comment someone recommended The Doomsday Machine as a good episode to check out.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to give that episode a go and I thought it was pretty good (although not as great as what I expected from what is supposedly one of the best TOS episodes). So.. I now started watching the series from the start. I'm about five episodes in and so far, I'm struggling to see why people like it so much. I know it's extremely old but I find the production value to be incredibly bad sometimes (although to be fair, I was surprised that it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would). A lot of the acting is real bad. Also, I know the sexism is ""of it's time"" but even so it's a bit cringey to watch..

I had kind of expected there to be fantastic stories to make up for all of the downsides, but so far it's disappointing. Two of the episodes I've seen so far were also extremely similar in that they dealt with someone having ""esper"" powers and threatening the safety of the ship etc.

That said, I do actually really like Kirk and Spock, they're probably my favourite thing about it so far.

&amp;#x200B;

So my rambling aside, is there some kind of Riker's beard point where it picks up and becomes really good? Or is this pretty much how it is the entire time?

What the poster brings to this is that the dog collar has a Star Fleet badge stating ""No1""

Picard and crew go to Romulas to help Riker and everyone else evacuate, only to fail and the Titan is destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most iconic props associated with Captain Jean-Luc Picard, his “desk crystal” appears prominently in no  
fewer than 78 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, often in his hands during the iconic speeches on moral and  
ethical issues that are so fundamental to the character of Star Trek’s most ruminative captain.  
Our re-creation is made of high-end lead crystal: a special blend of optical-grade borosilicate glass with an extremely  
high refractive index, clear enough for use in lenses, prisms, and other optics. Its impressive heft makes it suitable for  
use as a paperweight, and it's just the right size to be waved about in one’s hand for oratorical emphasis, as its  
prismatic properties glimmer and sparkle in the light. The crystals are each meticulously formed, wet-ground, and  
polished by hand at a company that specializes in fine crystal glassware and chandeliers.  
The 3D geometry of the crystal was obsessively reconstructed using digital 3D modeling software, referencing and  
reconciling hundreds of film frames of the crystal’s appearances across the seasons of TNG. We spoke to crew  
members and vendors involved in the original production of the show and went through approximately 30 physical  
prototypes before we were confident we had gotten the sizing, along with the number of facets and their orientation, as  
accurate as possible with with all available reference materials.  
This is the first installment in a planned three-piece Picard Desk Set, and the crystal has been produced in limited  
quantities, so don’t miss this opportunity to assemble the full set. It’s a great way to add a bit of commanding gravitas  
to your workspace, whether that’s the Ready Room of a starship, or a tabletop at a café.",startrek,1562783883,RyanLutzMagic,6,5,True,2019-07-10

So, if humans on Earth have eradicated poverty and become so morally evolved, why does Picard's dog have cropped ears?

Because Earth isn't the only place where humans are, and not all humans are loyal to the Federation!

Memory Alpha has a long list of colonies that declared their independence from Earth or the Federation. The dog could have come from the crime-riddled Turkana IV where Tasha Yar grew up. Or the dog might be from one of the Maquis colonies on Solosos III, Quatal Prime, Veloz Prime, or Tracken II. Or any of the other human colonies within the Demilitarized Zone. There's [a whole list of human colonies that declared their independence from Earth and/or the Federation on Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation_colonies#Colonies_independent_from_Earth_or_the_Federation).

There are plenty of places where there could be humans with dogs, living in poverty, living with crime, living with violence.

All the movies (obviously), DS9 war arc and ENT S3-4 are Movie Trek.

**Discovery is Movie Trek.** With a few TV Trek episodes in early Season 2 showing that they're aware of the distinction.

I've finally figured out why my friends haven't been able to come to terms on Star Trek. This is it.

* TV Trek watchers enjoy episodes that are mostly standalone, and which delve into speculative fiction, social issues, technological issues, and philosophy akin to non-fantastical episodes of classic Twilight Zone.

* Movie Trek watchers enjoy seeing Better Humans face off against the unknown with plenty of technology- and intelligence-based action, more like later Stargate seasons. (Stargate, BTW, was another show that shifted from TV Trek to Movie Trek over the years).

The only series that I think struck a complete balance between both TV Trek and Movie Trek was Deep Space 9, but of course that series was basically a perfect storm of sci fi talent.

That happened to me a few months ago and since then I've ran into new and interesting content. I recommend the following for anyone seeking a space or sci-fi fix:

One the realism side of things:
* The Planets. A new BBC documentary series about our planets. The graphics are amazing!

* Mars on US Netflix is a TV show telling a fictional story of the first people to colonize Mars. There's currently two seasons but unfortunately only the first one is on US Netflix.

A mix of realism with sci-fi:
* The Expanse tv show and novels. The show does a good job of depicting the physics of space, the politics and economics of human colonization among the planets, their moons and space stations. Plus it has a good dose of sci-fi. It's a fun ride!

* There's a Mars mission episode in the Twilight Zone (2019)

* Elite: Dangerous. I'm new to the game and can't do a good job of explaining it. It's on all platforms so check out the reviews. A huge draw to the game is its simulation aspects and its setting. It's set in the Milky Way galaxy and is a 1:1 scale of our galaxy - to our best estimates at the time of the game's development. The game continues to get new content.

My research was on the use of smartwatches by runners, but my desire to study wearable computers is a tribute to Geordi and Data who I grew up watching as kid.  I was the only person in my house that watched Star Trek, but that just meant the show was all mine.

During my doctoral studies, my mother died.  I wanted to quit and felt broken.  I wasn’t quite sure how reddit worked, but my very first anything, was me asking for help, for a lifeline, for someone to talk to me, because I felt alone.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Latino/comments/1czcz3/emotionally_struggling_latino/

I received almost no response and I turned to the one thing that gave me solace, Star Trek.

I rewatched TNG and episodes like Heart of Glory which helped me cope with not being able to attend the funeral due to being across the country by thinking of a dead body as just a shell. 

Episodes like Hero Worship helped me remember that her death was not my fault and to not blame myself for her death. 

So many other episodes across Star Trek that deal with death helped me cope with the sadness, loneliness, depression, and helped see me through to today.

And along the way, I got involved in this subreddit with awesome people who I’ve had great conversations with, and who have shared my love of Star Trek.

On a day like today (I wrote this on the 10th at night), I am reflecting on the wonderful people that made this possible.  

Thanks to Star Trek and this community, I got to see my dream come alive and nobody could bend or break me as I reached for the stars.  

And if that made you roll your eyes and smile because of my super lame Star Trek: Enterprise reference, then my job is truly complete.

Now she has put up with a lot of the womanizing in the show and still kept pushing through, wanting to watch it, my little 9yr old Cadet.

So same as with all the other TOS, why are women treated this way questions she has asked, to which I could only answer ""that it was how society was back then and she needed to Realise it was  a pre-warp civilization that was making the show"" she seems to accept that answer well.

But with this last episode, I cant exactly say that as its apparently a regulation or so we understood from what Janice lester was saying.

Women of Star Trek,  can you please tell me how this episode made you feel?    Can you help me understand what my little girl is going through and maybe what to say, I dont want this to shade her idea of Star Trek, or convince her that she can't be a Captain of anything she wants to.

The Xindi were tricked by the sphere builders into thinking humans would destroy the new Xindi homeworld in the future. They did this because they wanted the Xindi to destroy earth and the human race as they'd repel the sphere builder invasion of the galaxy in the future. Before the attack, Earth didn't know about the impending threat. If the Xindi didn't send out a prototype weapon and instead didn't attack until they had a full-sized working weapon, Earth wouldn't have been prepared and likely would have been destroyed. 

So the attack with the prototype set up the chain of events that ultimately undid the sphere builders' plan. Or am I missing something?",startrek,1562893316,Premium_Stapler,21,17,True,2019-07-11

I'm attempting to create a table of organization for my custom home-brew starship crew (80 Strong).

So far for the command positions I have: 

Captains, Executive Officers, and Adjutants (None of which are really departments per say.) 

Then I have the more obvious departments:

Flight Controllers, Navigation (But not Astrometrics because that's different or something), Conn (Helmsmen), and Shuttle Pilots.

If Operations and Engineering fall under a division who's job is to maintain the ship why would you throw security into this already bloated division when there are very few real departments in Command? Not to mention then why the heck are there so many ""red shirts"" running around in TNG and later? Shouldn't like 90% of the crew be either Gold or Teal?

2524,Property Ownership in the Federation,"More specifically, on Earth. Picard's family has their vineyard, Kirk has a home in the mountains, and there are many housing units that seem more desirable than others. How do they decide who gets what?

I assume that there had to have been a seizure of property or general abolition of most private property when the United Earth government was formed. There had to be in order for all the new housing units to be made unless Earth bought or is leasing the property they're on which seems unlikely. So how did Picard's and Kirk's family's get to keep their properties (although Kirk mentioned he sold it in Generations which causes another issue) while it doesn't seem like many others got that option? What if I want my own vineyard in France or cabin in the Rockies (I assume that's where it was)? 

I guess the point is, there are some properties and locations that are more desirable than others on Earth so how does the Federation/Earth government decide who gets what? Other than the possible plot hole with Kirk's cabin in Generation, I'm assuming the government owns essentially all the property lest people start selling their property to Ferengi or whatnot. 

Maybe there's a waiting list for the highly desirable properties. Or maybe a merit system. A decorated starship captain who served valiantly for decades should probably get priority over a nice beach home in Hawaii over a random citizen.

I think Star Trek is a bit inconsistent about it: sometimes it appears that they program it or put it to a certain setting before administering, other times they fill them. But all the ""quick, your hypospray"" from the TOS and TAS era (and later on sometimes as well) wouldn't work if they were just fancy SF syringes, right? (FTR I was just looking a TAS episode where Kirk said to Bones to ""set his hypospray to maximum tranquilizer"", or something like that, which is what brought my question on.)

2549,"Dathon, the Tamarians, and Language","Yes, another post about the Dathon and the Tamarian language.

I had a thought a while back - probably over a year ago, and I’ve been sitting on it.  I can’t think of a reason why my idea about the Tamarian language wouldn’t provide a plausible explanation.

Technologically the Tamarians are on a level roughly equivalent to the Federation - warp drive capable, weapons and shields better than the Enterprise, matter/energy transport technology, all that good stuff.

The Tamarian language we heard, the concepts they were trying to convey, were based on a shared understanding of the meaning behind the words.

I - like almost everybody else - found it hard to believe that a society capable of doing these things would have a language so clunky and difficult to use in a scientific or mathematical setting.  How would you convey a new idea?  You could convey that you had a new idea (“Edison, a lightbulb over his head”), but the actual idea would be hard to explain if you could only use a language dependent on historical events.

And then it hit me.

The Tamarians could have a system of writing that doesn’t exactly line up with how they speak.  Usually written and spoken words are interchangeable.  The written word represents what is spoken.  But maybe not for the Tamarians.

Just because that’s never happened on Earth (as far as I know, I’m not a linguist), doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.

They could convey complex ideas, ideas of science and mathematics, music, theories, abstract ideas - all using a written language that is more suited to the purpose than simply using metaphors.  They could even convey the mundane through their written language. But when it comes to verbal communication they speak in metaphors, grand ideas, and emotions.

Dathon did have a written journal.

Anyway - that’s the idea I had.",startrek,1562987524,Glock1911,5,3,True,2019-07-12

2554,Just watched ENT: Cogenitor. I get it now.,"Lonely Friday night, house to myself. Roommates gone, just me and the walls. I cooked dinner and let the carousel of channels spin. Yeah I still have cable, I like the... randomness, of it. 


We have this channel, I’ve never heard of it. H&amp;I. Too many forced commercial breaks with products clearly meant for older people. But they play a lot of Trek so I’m into it. Every day there’s a stretch called All Star Trek and they play a TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT episode each. Tonight’s ENT episode was Cogenitor. 


I almost changed it. I’ve never liked ENT. I just never cared for it. When it first aired (UPN?) I had just moved into my grandmothers house and having grown up watching TOS and TNG when I was 8-12 years old, I heard about it and read up on it... ship designs, uniform designs, it had that guy I recognized from Quantum Leap as the captain. Jolene Blalock... okay she had my attention. But anyway, gave it a go and I just didn’t click with it. A couple years later it was cancelled and I just figured I’d been right about it. 


I’ve rewatched TNG and DS9 more times than I can count; the latter being an acquired taste that easily became my favorite Trek. I love morality plays, what Trek is best at arguably. And this episode was just the perfect bottle episode of that. 


I loved how Archer is so different a captain, the quiet rage he held for Trip at the end. How he desperately wanted to hold on to a successful first contact but also balance his own moral compass too. These aliens were smarter than us, they were more advanced than us, they could be a vital ally and they liked us too! The family was affable despite the oppression they were a willing participant of. And you could feel their confusion at Trip’s insistence, their anger in his brazen judgment. 


And best yet the episode has stood the test of time and how it can feel relevant to today’s own issues. I’ll leave that open to interpretation of the reader. 


I guess all I’m saying is, I get it. I finally get why some people say ENT isn’t as bad as people made it out to be. And I’m sure I’m gonna find some clunkers, and my eyes are gonna roll at some parts. But I’m gonna go find them for myself. Because I’m starting at episode 1 now. And I finally have some new Trek to check out.

My favourites:

&amp;#x200B;

**Return My Ship**  
Invisible beings beam aboard the Enterprise and plan to take it beyond our galaxy. The beings are impossible to fight since no one knows where they are. Kirk reasons that if they command the ship, they must be in the control room. He faces nothing but orders the return of his craft. The beings, impressed at his bravery, surrender. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mindless Man**   
Captain Kirk strains to think but his mind is a complete blank. Every thinking capacity of his brain has been stopped by a ray from creatures on a distant planet. Helplessly, the captain wanders the alien planet. If just one thought can enter his mind—he sees a flower and thinks how small it is. He is saved. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Joker**  
Mr. Spock is again the dead center target of an enemy ion fuser. He has escaped the deadly foe once by playing on their love of humor. Now, in his humorless manner, he struggles to remember another Earth joke. Onc was difficult enough to recall . Two he does not know if he can do. Suddenly, ""Why do some men wear suspenders?""

Even if humans are all ""evolved,"" they welcome visitors right? Those visitors never commit crime? In fact we see humans committing crimes. Crazy admirals come to mind, scientists willing to sacrifice life forms in the pursuit of science, that happens multiple times, rogue captains, the Maquis, that time a woman stole Kirk's body. All this suggests that humanity still has some propensity for criminality or disorder and would still need a police force. But does all of that somehow never happen on Earth?

I read an article today conjecturing about possible cross over between Picard and Discovery, one that used a lot of ""what if Picard finds out about Discovery?"" and similar suppositions (and based on the fact they'll share a distribution platform). But then I got to thinking; He already does.

Picard back in TNG mind melded with Sarek, and experienced many of his most personal and emotional moments, learning things about Spock that Spock himself didn't even know. Sarek's control over a self filter was non-existent, so are we to believe that he held back feelings about Michael? It seems very likely that the information was shared, though Picard, being Picard, would have honored the Star Fleet redacted ""vow of silence"". This would give the writers an in story wise if they wanted to leverage some kind of cross over story.

2585,Finally finished Voyager after twenty years,"I remember watching Voyager in high school with my dad. We'd watched TNG before that together. It was cherished bonding time for us. We never really got into DS9, though I watched a few years back and enjoyed it.

Sometime around Voyager season 3 we kind of tuned out. Life got busy and it fell by the way side. I remember tuning in for the finale and being unimpressed and for a long time, that was my impression of Voyager. Unimpressive. 3rd fiddle. The red-headed stepchild (no offense to red heads).

I finally got around to watching it on Netflix over the past year, and today I just finished Endgame. For all it's faults, I really came to love the Voyager family. I didn't think I'd miss them when I ran out of new episodes, but I do.

I can only attribute my earlier assessment of Endgame to teenaged cynicism, because watching it again as an adult, I think it's perfect. 

[SPOILERS if you haven't seen it] The use of time-travel was a wonderful ""have your cake and eat it too."" We get to see the Voyager crew in the future, having returned home the hard way, the long way, the full journey that seven years of television can't encapsulate. We see the toll, the loss that it has taken on them. Contrasting this with Voyager's present raised the stakes wonderfully. I loved having two Janeways - one armored with idealism and principal, the other worn down by grief into pragmatism - and it wasn't until the later seasons that I came to appreciate her as a captain, as a leader, and as a surrogate mother for the crew and us the audience. There were scenes that made my eyes moist, knowing this was the end of our journey together.

And then the Borg. For a show that leaned a little too heavily on them, I thought the decision to have Voyager essentially destroy the collective was great. Go big or go home. It was epic. 

And it was intimate. I know it's cheesy, but I enjoyed the Seven and Chakotay love story. I was enamored with Paris and B'Ellana's budding family and enjoyed seeing them as older parents. All the farewell moments worked for me, with the exception of Harry's eye-roll inducing speech. The sentiment was nice, but Garret Wang, as with many of his moments in the show, couldn't pull it off. But he tried.

I know it's not awarding-winning, or mold-breaking, or genre-defining, but Voyager, like the Enterprise D before her, was my home for the duration of it's run and I bonded with these characters without even realizing it. For all it's mistakes and problems and borderline laziness (I lost count of the number of times they beamed someone through shields or from ridiculous distances just because the plot required it), it had an infectious charm, and though it was guided by less steady hands than previous shows, the core or if it was still intensely Star Trek in nature.

I'm sad it's over, but it's nice to know I've added another Star Trek family next to TNG. I know I'll be visiting them again.

2594,Thoughts on Discovery and Deep Space Nine from a non-Trekkie,"Spoilers for DS9 and first season of Discovery below:

Like the title says, I have to start this post by making clear that I am not a Trekkie. For the vast majority of my media-consuming life I've found Trek to be a strangely impenetrable clique, obsessed with minutiae and canon, attached to a vision of science fiction that I, a son of a mathematician and biologist, found somewhat flippant in how it handles the arena of space and spaceflight. Need to get down to the planet? Sure! Just.... dematerialize a human being and put him back together, whatever. Can't talk to aliens? Now you can, just like that! No gravity? Sure, we'll just sidestep a fundamental force of the universe with *plating*. 

I'm sure I lost a lot of you just like that, but I really want people to know where I'm coming from; I have never had any affection for Trek, or Trek's style. I don't like how the starships look, I find the Federation and Starfleet-- not its ideals necessarily, mind you-- ludicrous, especially since I served in the US military. What kind of insane organization puts women and children on a warship? And don't try and tell me that a *Galaxy*-class starship isn't a warship, because I'm pretty sure it's got multiple phaser banks and civilization-ending yield warheads that disagree. This is all ignoring the civic fact that Starfleet is basically the DoD and State Department merged into one and there is a very good reason both of those things are separate authorities.

Many of these opinions I still hold. I still don't find Trek's aesthetic curves appealing, and in the realm of space combat I prefer the anaesthetic grit of a franchise like the Expanse to the perplexingly kinetic smoothness of warfare in the Trek universe, with its exploding consoles and gliding dogfights. 

I say all of this because recently I was convinced, after years of aborted attempts, to actually watch DS9 and I was honestly blown away by it. I finished it in a few weeks and now that its done with, I find myself trying other Trek series I had once dismissed, I even tried to watch the first season of Voyager (unsuccessfully) in a vain attempt to fill the vacuum left in my heart by one of the greatest science fiction ensembles ever put to film. I even went back and finished the first season of Discovery, which I had dropped after the Lorca reveal, and I even enjoyed it, having developed a tolerance for Trek's foibles due to my love of DS9.

Rewatching Discovery in this way made me consider the parallels between DS9 and the first season of Discovery, and it's helped me to articulate what bothered me so much about Discovery when I first watched it, even if I enjoy it more now.

At its core, both shows (again, season one of Discovery is what I'm referencing) are about the Federation under the stresses of war, albeit stretched out over multiple seasons in the case of DS9. But where they fundamentally disagree is in the meaning of the cracks they make under that pressure. *In Pale Moonlight* is often agreed upon to be the best DS9 episode amongst fans of the show, and in that episode Sisko's compromises are treated as, if not necessary, the best course of action given the hand the Federation was dealt. The Federation *is* the banner of idealism in the Alpha Quadrant, of course it is, but the show makes a point to show that there *is* a limit to what ideals can do under extraordinary circumstances. When it violates its principles, those violations are treated as what they are-- violations-- but the point seems to be that it is possible to err, to recognize that error, to commit to that error, and leave it at that. That not every compromise, like in the real world, is the start of some Shakespearean slippery slope into cartoon villainy. 

In contrast, Discovery plays the ideological problems of the Federation in PRECISELY that manner. At the start of Discovery, Burnham violates Federation principles, going so far as to mutiny, in order to save lives. Throughout the majority of the season, she serves under a morally grey Captain on what is, from what I can tell, essentially a black ops vessel. This is what drew me to the show to begin with, before I had watched DS9-- I thought that the show basically WAS what I would discover to be DS9 later. I was fascinated by that set up, because I was interested not in how it deconstructed ideals but how they *justified* them in the face of stresses.

It's unfortunate, then, that at the conclusion of the first season Michael Burnham again shows defiance to Starfleet, but this time to instead present a 'third way'. This 'third way' basically sums up why I think Discovery doesn't reach the heights of DS9; instead of putting its characters in the grinder, instead of putting them in a hard place where there are no ideal solutions, it instead creates the *atmosphere* of that dilemma, but ultimately chooses to solve its problems by essentially author fiat. 

What is the difference between Michael's choices at the start of Discovery versus at the end of Discovery? I understand that the show treats them as bookends, but if that were the case, shouldn't Michael's choice to defy Starfleet at the end of the season be informed by the failure of the first choice and the season inbetween? The problem is that we never see whether Burnham actually WAS wrong not to give the 'Vulcan hello'. Instead, her mutiny fails, we never return to the subject of whether Burnham was right in that instance except via oblique thematic contrast via Lorca, and in the end the war is ended because.... there was a nice Klingon?

Why do the Klingons end the war? They respect strength and are not above deception in war, why would T'Rell not simply unify the Empire and then continue the war against this foolish, sentimental state that handed her such a massive opportunity? In fact, I am not even certain that it is made clear in any conversation that T'Rell WOULD cease the war against the Federation, Michael pretty much hands her a bomb and calls it a day.

In the end, I did enjoy Discovery. I think it's well acted, I like how modern the costuming and props are, and I don't mind its plot, but ultimately, its message doesn't seem to go further than, 'just find a way'. Find the metaphorical hydro bomb in the water table. That's not what DS9 was, and that's a crying shame.",startrek,1559353722,Cook_0612,43,17,True,2019-05-31

2597,Voyager's Torpedo Issue,"Hello all, 

I posted this idea maybe 2-3 years back, and it got some notoriety; however I delete most all of my old posts.  Anyways, the amount of people referencing Voyagers Toropedo's in the recent ""Voyager Shuttle Loss"" post leaves me thinking most haven't heard of the theory.

Anyways, Voyager starts with ""38 torpedo's"" but somehow uses way more through the series.  

I submit that they simply replicated the torpedo body/warp sustainer and then split the torpedo warhead antimatter into smaller amounts.  

How many times do they need a torpedo at full power?  If you split the existing antimatter yield across multiple torpedo's, you would have a large array of options, torpedoes at 1/4 full power for example.  This would be extremely handy when dealing with many species in the unknown quadrant. Dealing with a weaker species but want to impress them to your firepower?  Use a ""minimum yield torpedo"".  Collapsing a spacial anomaly?  Why use a full power photon torpedo spread when a torpedo with 1/8 yield will suffice?

Basically, they split their existing yield amongst more replicated Torpedos.  

There are many inconsistencies with Voyager, but the torpedo issue is one of the more easily dismissable one in my opinion.

2635,How Star Trek: Picard could (initially) connect to DISCO,"While I was in the shower this morning, I began thinking about the new Picard show and how stoked I was to see Sir Patrick back in the role. Wondering where the show might go, I began to think about how 'Picard' could tie in to DISCO. Here are my thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Picard left Starfleet after failing to help save Romulus. Accordingly, he went home to take over the family wine business, defeated and broken.

\- Starfleet asks Picard to come back because they need his help as an archaeologist AND his connection to Spock and Sarek (more on that in a moment). 

\- Starfleet, having barely beaten back the Dominion and the Borg not too long ago, and with their 'failure' with the Hobus star and the loss of Romulus, are looking at ways to defend against these problems in the future.

\- The idea here is to dig up old lines of research and technology that may have dead-ended due to the scientific limitations of the day.

\- Sifting through old records, logs, and reports to find technologies that might benefit the Federation moving forward, higher-ups in Starfleet notice gaps in historical records around the late 2250's. Specifically, records of a young Spock, one Captain Pike, and members of the USS Enterprise.

\- At first, it seems coincidental (perhaps poor record-keeping, or specific missions that were redacted, which in itself isn't unusual).

\- More digging leads to the fact the USS Enterprise, and more specifically Spock, Pike, and Number One, were involved to some degree in the investigation of mysterious 'Red Signals' that were popping up across the galaxy around this time. Pike was specifically tasked with the temporary command of a ship that was not the Enterprise during the stardates in question.

\- Further, there are separate mentions and brief glimpses of reference to another ship aiding in the Red Signal investigation (could it be the ship Pike commanded temporarily?). 

\- A chance find reveals a reference to a Federation ship researching the Red Signals had the ability to transverse space near instantaneously (could it be the ship Pike commanded temporarily?).

\- Seeing the technology, if real, would have greatly assisted the Federation with their recent wars and with the Romulan relief armada, Starfleet analysts and admiralty continue the search. 

\- This is where the connection to Spock and Sarek come in. Knowing Picard was close to Spock and had melded with Sarek, Starfleet reaches out to him in order to assist the Federation in identifying/finding this 'lost technology.'

\- Starfleet knows Sarek was involved in some degree, due to transit records (duly kept by the Vulcans) coinciding with the locations and times the official logs seem to have holes. Even if Sarek wasn't directly involved, it is hoped he may have known something as Spock's father.

\- It is hoped Picard may have learned something either through the meld with Sarek, OR in his conversations with Spock.

\- Starfleet hopes to pursuade (or guilt) Picard into assisting them with the search for this technology, stating having the technology (which no one actually knows exists definitely) would have saved the Romulans, and possibly Spock himself.

\- Insert the promo CBS dropped where Picard is being asked about why he left Starfleet.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea would be the rediscovery of the history of the USS Discovery would be an overarching theme of the first season, with other (essentially more important character development) happening in the forefront. The DISCO is basically a McGuffin to get the band back together.

So as I understand it the enterprise in the show is sort of a luxury cruise ship with families and other civilians on board. Is it ever addressed in the show or in other material how those people are effected in their day to day activities when the ship is being attacked or something else is going on? If the ship is being shot at are they just not feeling the effects of it? That’s never made sense to me.

I know Deanna Troi is seen as a controversial character by some and I do think it’s kinda silly that she sits next to the captain on the bridge but regardless of all this, her hair is G O R G E O U S.

2657,Borg drone shielding and how to over come adaptations,"First off, this is my first post here and while I like star trek I am not completely up to snuff on lore and technical stats. So apologies ahead of time if i get anything too Wrong.

So as my title states, Borg shielding adapts after 2-3 drones are taken out but a certain weapon. My thought/question is this, would you be able to use a combination of weapons that each time the shield adapts to a specific weapon would it then make the shield vulnerable to another of those weapons. For example, say you take a kinetic assault rifle and mount a phaser, disrutor and maybe a plasma grenade launcher or something. my thinking is that a Borgs shielding by adapting to one weapon would inherently make itself weaker to another form of weapon. 

Since if it could adapt to one weapon and hold said adaptation indefinitely why would the Borg not maintain said adaptation thus making their shielding impenetrable and only grow stronger as the met new kinds of weapons. Since this doesn't seem to be the case a variety of different forms of weapons should cause problems to the adaptation capability of the Borg. Basically make them focus their adapting down one path, to make it weak to another path.

so that is what was rolling around in my brain recently, I thought it might be a god idea to get it out an see what others think. i don't know if the thought is viable but it seems like it would work.",startrek,1559533215,TranscendentalBeard,10,0,True,2019-06-02

I don't understand, based on my knowledge of Voyager up to this point, DS9 and TNG, why Voyager thinks risking Borg interaction is a better deal than going around Borg space. They are already looking at a 70 (minus whatever) year voyage that they have no problem delaying due to discovery. Surely they expect to discover nothing in Borg territory but death, right? Wouldn't going around Borg space produce far better exploration and incite into the Borg? Why not interact with ever civ that has interacted with the Borg, and see if they know anything useful?

&amp;#x200B;

I realize this could just be a plot device. I'm just curious if there is ST canon I'm missing that makes them think Voyager will stand a better chance than the combined armada at wolf 359.

2691,Captain Pike in Discovery was bland and boring -- Also a rant about DSC haters in general,"I see people saying how awesome Pike was, but honestly he could have not been present the entire season and I probably wouldn't have noticed a difference. His character is a boring cookie cutter Star Trek captain, and I guess that's what people like about him and why they hate Disco so much. He brings literally nothing new to the table at all.

ST:DSC is NOT like the previous Star Treks, and it doesn't aim to be. If the main reason you hate it is because it doesn't ""fit"" with the feel or ""style"" of previous Star Treks, you need to stop complaining. People made the same complaints about all of the 90s Treks compared to the original series.

And for those who think Discovery is too SJW, have you watched like ANY of the other Star Treks? Like half of the episodes in any given series (particularly the 90s ones) were devoted SPECIFICALLY to communicating a social justice message, often under the veneer of an alien culture or something being the marginalized group. 

Discovery, as far as I can tell has had ZERO episodes with social justice themes. All it has is REPRESENTATION. Just people of diversity being the main characters and the heros and going about their lives. They're not ""rubbing it in your faces"" by simply showing people of color and females as the main characters. It's more realistic than the straight white male captain/savior who comes in and solves social justice issues by sprinkling his blessings on the poor marginalized groups. People in particular seem more pissed that the show has the audacity to show regular people of all different backgrounds  being a part of Star Fleet and saving the day, rather than the same white male savior. This is what they often mean, I feel, when they say that Disco is terrible because it doesn't have the same ""feel"" or ""style"" as previous Star Treks.

And Discovery is even more awesome because its female protagonists aren't just sexual object ninja bad-asses like all other sci-fi shows with female protagonists are. She doesn't have unrealistic super martial arts abilities which she uses to kick bad guys butts while dressed in skimpy clothing (a la KillJoys, Firefly, or Dark Matter). Michael is just a smart woman and a good leader (granted Voyager was good with this too--another series that people on here like to hate on).

Overall Disco is just showing a more realistic view of what a crew might look like in the future that Star Trek imagines, and that sometimes the main character isn't ALWAYS the attractive straight white male dude. Get over it.",startrek,1559639594,peregrin5,7,0,True,2019-06-04

2693,"""Past Tense"" is almost disturbing to watch now. DS9 Season 3 Episodes 11 &amp; 12.","For those who don't recall, the episode largely takes place in 2024. More specifically, around a historically significant event that completely changed the course of human history. That event became known as the Bell Riots. When something happened (Bashir &amp; Sisko being thrown back in time) that disrupted that event, it completely changed history and the Federation never existed. 

At various points Sisko and Bashir (mostly Bashir) are appalled at the conditions that lead to the Bell Riots, with Bashir frequently going off about the apparent complete lack of compassion for the inhabitants of the Sanctuary District in which they find themselves. 

At the end of the episode Bashir is talking to Sisko on the Defiant, and says that after getting a glimpse of the early 21st century he can't understand how they could have let things get so bad. Sisko replies that he didn't have an answer. 

That episode aired 24 years ago (fack I'm old). The ""Bell Riots"" were a watershed moment in history that led to massive social and economic change, and hypothetically they're supposed to take place a little over 5 years from now (they happen in August). 

Taking a look around, this episode is disturbingly prescient. I mean, I know a lot of Trek has serious staying power in its relevancy (several of Picard's speeches come to mind), but this...

2699,Germanys recent development in the show makes no sense at all [Parody Post],"So, I‘ve been following that series since the very start now and I have to say they really ruined the germans in the recent seasons if you ask me. They portrayed them in a nice and consistent way from the start with Otto I. In 962 when the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (what a name, what where the writers thinking?) was founded untill it was disbanded by Franz II. In 1806. I enjoyed as well the 19th century arc with the German confederation and finally the wars with Denmark, Austria and France that would ultimately lead to a new, if smaller, german empire (finally a name that doesn‘t need half a minute to say or write) under Emperor Wilhelm I. And Chancellor Bismark (Say what you want but Bismarks writing and Actor where just great, probably one of the best performances in the entire series).

Now to the core of the Problem in the 20th century: What they did there makes no god damn sense. How many times does germanys kind of government change in a single century? 4 Times? That is just silly. First they decided to dissolve the German empire again after just 47 short years, opposed to the over 740 years that the old empire lasted, then they install a democracy for only, how many, 14 years? Then the writers change their minds, again, and make it a dictatorship for 12 years. I don‘t know what happend in the writers room and with the showrunners but it looks like they where unable to decide what they wanted to do with the show and made it two shows, splitting Germany in two and made one yet another democracy and the other yet another dictatorship, this time a communist one. Then they discarded the communism Idea and just fused it together with the 
While I have to admit that the 20th century had some very intruiging storylines, good actors and well written characters, it was just completely bonkers with those constantly changing Ideas of what germany was supposed to be. Just give me the empire back and thus was germany always was and is supposed to be. Any real fan of the show knows that.

Ira Steven Behr basically admitted this was the hook to get Avery Brooks involved, even though he ended up opting out. Also the weak pitch they came up with only really covered a fanciful first episode, so the whole thing seemed to be a pointless exercise.

Also Rick Berman should have been challenged on sone of his decisions, especially surrounding the departure of Terry Farrell. It’s patently obvious she was referring to him when she diplomatically discussed what went down. There could have been a bit more honesty.

And by having Ira Behr producing and presenting, the whole thing felt too ‘in’. A third party director might have brought a fresh approach IMO.

This person was hanging out with me and few other fellow Trek fans one night and pulled them up on a laptop.  Here's what I remember.

The Chris Hemsworth audition showed the dialogue he had with his wife, with a casting director reading them off screen.  It was almost word for word what ended up in the final film.  What's funny is that it at first I thought it was supposed to be Captain Kirk (he was a complete unknown at the time), and after watching the director's commentary, JJ intended did that intentionally, making out it to be a red herring for a few moments before he died.

Anton Yelchin's original audition was with a spot-on, perfect Russian accent, which makes sense because he was born there and moved to the US as a baby.  I was told at the time that the while the production really liked him, they felt his Russian accent was a little too good, and they wanted it more like Walter Koenig's.

Zachary Quinto's tape was exactly what you saw in the movie.  Apparently he had been campaigning for the role for years, and he was the very first one to be cast.  It made for good headlines at the time because he was the main villain on ""Heroes.""

All I remember about Chris Pine's audition was pretty much what we saw in the movie, too.  The person who showed me the auditions said that a LOT of other actors went in doing a William Shatner impression and they were looking for something original.

One interesting audition I saw was Joshua Jackson for Kirk.  All I remember is that he played it straight, as well, no Shatner impression.  I know he's talked about it publicly since, but this was still a secret at the time.  I imagine that him having played Pacey on ""Dawson's Creek"" only a few years earlier would have made execs weary about casting him, which I get, but is also kind of a shame because he really is a good actor.

Well, I was thinking about Picard  character and realized that something that might cause him to retire is the destruction of his ship and crew. 

Do you think that the series might begin with the destruction of the Enterprise, the Titan and most of the rescue fleet? We then might see a time jump to the vineyard.",startrek,1559738368,HanRuan71,37,8,True,2019-06-05

2720,Not Particularly Excited for the Picard Series and Here's Why,"I'll preface this by saying that of course I would be delighted if the Picard series defied my expectations and was good. I'd even be okay with it if the show was just fine. I love Stewart as an actor and as a human and I have a great deal of fondness for Picard.

All that being said, everything that's been revealed about the upcoming series so far has made me very apprehensive about the quality of the show. A lot of this stems from showrunner Alex Kurtzman. I'm of the opinion that the man is a hack. Most of what I've seen that he's worked on has been awful. Here's a short list:

* Transformers (writer): total fucking garbage.
* Watchmen (script re-write): I have no idea what his contributions to the film were. I kind of like this movie but it fundamentally misunderstands what the book was about.
* Star Trek (2009) (writer): fine but total schlock.
* Star Trek: Into Darkness: total fucking garbage.
* Amazing Spider-Man 2: haven't seen myself but universally panned.
* Star Trek: Discovery: I know a lot of people on this sub like it (which is totally fine, you do you). I'm not one of them. The purpose of this post is not to shit on Discovery, just adding to the body of evidence.

So I feel justified in saying that I have very little confidence that Kurtzman can deliver an acceptable final product. I know that Stewart is also a producer on the show but there's nothing to suggest he has any kind of creative control. I also know that Kurtzman isn't solely responsible for the writing on the show so it's entirely possible that they're able to churn out some halfway decent scripts.

Another reason I'm not super stoked for this show is the premise, which actually loops back around to Kurtzman. We know that the story revolves around the aftermath of the destruction of Romulus. That was a plot point from Star Trek (2009). The way it goes is that a supernova destroyed the solar system and I guess the Romulans were not sufficiently prepared. Okay, let's think about that for a second. Supernovas only occur in the most massive of stars. They don't just randomly happen out of nowhere. If the Romulus system had such a star, surely every scientist in the galaxy would have known their star would eventually explode and would be able to predict when that would happen to a fair amount of accuracy. In real life, the star Betelgeuse will 100% go supernova (it may have already happened and we haven't seen it yet). With our current level of technology, we're able to narrow down when this will happen within a few hundred years.

Surely an advanced civilization capable of FTL space flight, teleportation, and literally using black holes as a power source (which in of itself requires knowledge of the mechanics stellar collapse leading to, you guessed it, supernovas) would be able to figure out that their home star was in imminent danger of exploding. Not only would the Romulans realize this, literally anyone pointing a telescope at Romulus can figure this out with a bit of maths. I'm implicitly giving them the benefit of the doubt that their star is massive enough to actually go supernova. If their star is anything like ours then it definitely isn't.

So why am I obsessing over these seemingly irrelevant scientific details? Why can't I just turn my brain off and enjoy the show? Because this is Star Trek and it purports to be science fiction, emphasis on the science. There's nothing wrong with science fantasy--I happen to like Star Wars as well and I don't give two shits about how the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon works because it doesn't matter to the story. The Falcon is merely a vehicle to get characters from one location to another. Star Trek does concern itself with these things. For the way these stories are structured, minor details like ""you can't beam through shields"" or ""ships use anti-matter as a power source"" are actually important. They establish rules for how things work in this universe. When stakes are raised, these rules inform the characters' decisions and constrain their actions. They help drive the drama in these stories.

When you stop giving a shit about these details, you get nonsense like Magic Red Matter, Magic Infinite Speed Spores, Magic Time Travel Suits, Magic Time Crystals, etc. There's nothing wrong with having mcguffins in a story but the more you focus on it, the more well-defined it needs to be. When one magic mcguffin is solved by another magic mcguffin, the stakes cease to matter. It just becomes a plot contrivance that has whatever properties the script requires at that moment. We need to take the Romulans off the board? Uh, their sun goes supernova, yadda yadda Red Matter boom.

Which is why I am baffled that the Picard show chose to double down on these issues by focusing on this rather stupid plot point from a 10-year old movie that has an at best tenuous connection to Picard. There are so many other loose threads from the run of TNG they could have focused on. Heck, they could have gone into completely uncharted territory. But instead, we're back to stupid magic nonsense. It's almost as if the same person that wrote the whole Romulus blowing up bit is the one running the show. Oh wait, it is.

I *really* hope that I'm wrong, that somehow against all odds, Kurtzman will deliver a show worthy of the character. I'm not holding my breath.",startrek,1559748854,arctic_ninja,41,0,True,2019-06-05

But at least the first season of TNG appears incredibly science fantastic. You have the godlike Q, the other godlike Portal character, the God of Edos, cross-space communication-destiny between Wyatt and Ariana, telepathy, etc.

Yes, yes someone will object that to a less educated mind highly advanced science appears like magic, and that is what is happening here. But it's odd that the show does not even attempt an explication of what we're seeing on screen on and even goes as far as to posit something like ""the universe (substitute God) works in mysterious ways.""

2735,Best of Both Worlds,"I’m rewatching TNG after not seeing many of these episodes in 15 years or longer (some never) and just finished Best of Both Worlds. Great episode but I had a couple of nerd thoughts lol. Since the enterprise knew they would be facing off with the borg and thought they would be killed (Picard worries about this and Guinan says the crew thinks they are going to die) did they make any efforts to evacuate the civilian population of the ship? It doesn’t make sense to take them along to what may be a hopeless battle. There are kids on the ship. Maybe they went on admiral Hansen’s ship to the star base?

When Picard was transported off the enterprise, Riker immediately asks O’Brien if he can get a lock on the captain and O’Brien says there’s too much interference. How did O’Brien know the captain was off the ship?  How did he try to get a lock in one second? I’ll file this along with the one second “hail them” “they are ignoring our hails”

At the end of part 1 on the borg ship why didn’t they see locutus before ? It looked like everyone was just standing in one spot before suddenly seeing him just standing there. (I guess he could have walked there) We also see a bunch of borg passing locutus heading towards the crew, but those borg disappear (or just stand along side locutus) allowing the crew to react. Seems like these drones could have easily assimilated the crew if they wanted to. 

Starfleet knew the borg were heading to earth and seemed to have days before they got there. Were any efforts made to evacuate the planet or inform the population?  I don’t remember if this is mentioned in Family.

2744,It's 2019 and I've come around on ST: ENT,"I'm doing a binge rewatch of Enterprise at the moment--I haven't touched the show since it went off the air and have done rewatches of everything else since then, so I figured it was time to give this another chance.

The show is not *nearly* as bad as people make it out to be. Here are some anecdotal things that I've caught myself thinking about:

**Jolene Blalock**: Though she was admittedly cast as a sex symbol for the show I think she eventually really came into her own as a Vulcan. Sure, sometimes her acting can be stilted but I've very much liked how she grew into her relationships with the crew and started to soften the edge of that Vulcan cynicism. Yes, I rolled my eyes every time they made an excuse to get her in anything less than her jumpsuit (including the infamous Vulcan neuropressure therapy scene), but for the most part I have enjoyed her more as the episodes progress.

**Archer**: I started out thinking that this is the weakest played character on the show. But the more I thought about it, I realized ""Hey, this dude has no idea what he's doing out here and he's trying to captain a ship of 100 people into deep space, which no one has ever done."" Bakula does have pretty good range and i think his interpersonal relationships with the crew may be the strongest performances. But his brashness in situations seems pretty well connected to the fact that he has to put on an air of experience even if everyone knows nobody is experienced. The confidence goes a long way. Also, there are many awkward exchanges between Archer and new aliens. OFC there would be awkwardness if you had been around humans for your entire life and now you're flying into a star with a dude you met yesterday and have to spent 3 days with him.

**Humans**: I found myself thinking about the fan theory that the humans are the mad scientists of the galaxy, and T'Pol, other Vulcans, and other aliens are always saying ""What the hell guys"" every time they pull something out. Routing weapons power through the impulse engines? Nuts. I was totally sold on this in one episode in particular: S2E22 ""Cogenitor"".  In Cogenitor, Archer decides ""hey, what the heck, let's fly into the star"" and gets warned against doing it. Besides him I don't think anyone attempts it again until Beverly Crushers tests out the Multiphasic Shielding in TNG. THEN when a solar flare erupts and the alien says to go around or over it, Archer says ""Nah I used to surf bro"" and flies through it, which had I guess never occurred to the aliens before. 

**General Behavior**: I love how different all the humans are. By TNG so much of Starfleet--the humans anyway--have been homogenized by Federation culture and also distance from their ancestors. Old phrases and some customs are lost on them, everyone has a pretty agreeable nature and goals. In ENT Starfleet is new, and there aren't dozens of planets and colonies to draw on. Instead you get the different cultures of Earth that are basically right on top of what we're used to right now. A Brit. A southern-accented engineer. A world-traveling linguist with a lot of experience with other cultures. They still watch movies and modern sports (future ones haven't been invented or stumbled upon yet). It seems that the only thing that's survived at TNG is Shakespeare and other great literature as well as your occasional hobby (white water rafting anyone? fishing) or you have to be a real enthusiast about it like Tom Paris.

2745,A Forgotten Thread in DS9,"DS9 did an incredible job of bringing in so many different threads, many that had seemed unimportant at the time, and making them factor into future events. However, there was one episode that I was really sure was going to matter later but didn't seem to. 

In ""One Little Ship"" (Season 6, Ep. 14), a lot of the plot revolved around the new race of Alpha Jem'Hadar, and their conflict with the older Gammas. Although this episode did a great job of once again presenting how deeply ingrained the Jem'Hadar's loyalty to the Founders is and how thorough their conditioning, I was definitely expecting this inner conflict within the Jem' Hadar to factor into the war.

There are a lot of ways I could have seen this influencing later conflicts but by the end there seemed to be much less attention on the Jem'Hadar, and weren't really treated as characters with depth later in the show as they were in season 6 and earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

Starfleet sends the Chief Engineer of a critical space station to another planet to... presumably collaborate/somehow research together? Aliens then decide to arrest, put on trial, convict, and begin O'Brien's sentence before even notifying the Federation or offering them any kind of representation in the legal proceedings. Hell, even Cardassia did that. Also to O'Brien, who has the worst luck, but that's besides the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there no such thing as diplomatic immunity? He wasn't actually a spy, so it wasn't like they had hard evidence to convict him. Also, if the political tension between the federation and the Argrathi is high enough that spies are a possibility to them, then why would they send one officer there alone in the first place? 

&amp;#x200B;

And, what frustrates me the most: no one seems to be angry that this happened. The Argrathi seemingly face no repercussions for essentially kidnapping and torturing a Federation Officer in their care, and everyone seems to treat it like just an unfortunate accident. 

&amp;#x200B;

For that matter, what is this experience supposed to accomplish? All they've accomplished is torturing their prisoners, then sending them back with years worth of agony and hatred for the government that inflicted it on them, now back in a younger/healthier body that can go free.

I recently began watching Next Generation from beginning to end. I'm currently on season 2 episode 3. And I don't want to muddy up the movie timelines with the series. 

ie. Watch too far into the series that it ruins a movie, or visa versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

When should I watch the movies and in what order? ie. after season 2 watch first movie, etc.

2757,Very Old Trek PC Game - Anyone help ID it?!,"I've been trying to find information on a very old Star Trek game I played many years ago, can't find anything, hoping the hive mind will have some info! I'll put down what I can recall about it here, maybe it will ring a bell for someone...

I *think* it was called 'Star Trek: Alien Attack', or possibly Alien Invasion, something in that general area. The executable file used to run it was called 'TrekWin', or 'WinTrek', something like that. It was set in TOS Era. Would have been playing it around 1996 or 1997, but even then it seemed old. I had a copy on a floppy disk, but sadly it's no longer readable (I do have a floppy drive for some weird work purposes, the disk is just wrecked). 

You controlled a little sprite Enterprise, which could move on a grid, up, down, left and right. You would go past little planets and stars, find various alien vessels (I think they were from a non-canon race, but you could also find Klingons and Romulans). You could fire phasers or torpedoes at the hostile vessels. You had finite di-lithium crystals, and had to return to a star base to refill them.

I distinctly recall when docking you had to manually set the alert status, I think to condition blue. I think you also set the alert status in other situations, like if you didn't hit red alert when you saw an alien, you had no shields (maybe). 

The game window was divided in to two parts, ship and nearby space to the right, some info, controls and status on the left. You could access different ship systems, like selecting long range sensors would bring up this weird numeric grid which I never understood, but supposedly would help you find enemies. 

I'm fairly sure as I'm writing this that most, if not in fact all, commands were typed in. There may have been some mouse friendly, clickable bits. I seem to recall moving the ship by typing in grid coordinates rather than tapping arrow keys, for example. 

There was a time limit on the game, in that you had a set period in which to find and destroy all alien vessels before they would destroy...something. Earth, Starfleet HQ, something you wouldn't want destroyed anyway! I could never work out how to find them on long range sensors, so didn't ever beat the game. Maybe that's why I want to find it so bad!

2779,Did Damar really kill Ziyal?,"Maybe I'm wrong here and I would love someone to poke holes in this theory.

The only rebuttal I have is the ep with the genetically modified gang that Bashir hangs with. They see Damar and say something to the effect that he killed a princess. But I'm not so sure that was a cold read. These are the same people who impersonated an admiral and his staff ok one occasion and tried to give classified intel to the Dominion. It wouldn't surprise me if they knew about Damar before his address.

Now, to my reasoning:
1)We don't see Damar take the shot. We don't see anyone take the shot. It happened off screen.
2)We don't hear Damar until after the shot. You'd think if he were truly in the hallway he wouldn't have just shot. He would have yelled to Dukat that they need to leave.
3)No way Damar was around to hear her confession. She was very close to her dad and when the camera showed his reaction no one was behind him. Yet somehow he was there and close enough to hear it? I'm not buying it.
4)Ziyal's surprise. She told her dad she loves him and then he shot her. Had it been Damar, I also believe Dukat would have reacted to his presence.
5)We only have Dukat's account and he is unreliable. We know he has visual and auditory hallucinations later on. I always assumed it was because of his daughter's death. But what my theory presupposes is, maybe it was her betrayal that caused him to snap?

So, to recap, it seems likely that Dukat flipped out when she confessed and shot her. To take the blame off himself in his mind, he hallucinated Damar being there. Please someone prove me wrong.",startrek,1559915426,sobertillnoon,35,2,True,2019-06-07
2780,"For the Enterprise ep ""Minefield"" a section of the NX01 saucer section was made as a 1:1 practical set. Another amazing Doug Drexler share!","Check out this [amazing album](https://imgur.com/a/U63rkqi).

From Doug Drexler's FB (shamelessly reposted on imgur for all who can't visit there)

Doug writes:

""Still diligently scouring my archives, and endlessly scanning. This is some good stuff. We had the joy of building a 1:1 section of the NX-01 hull for the Enterprise episode ""Minefield"". With such a close knit art department, Herman would turn entire projects over to any one of us to oversee. For instance our recreations of the original series Enterprise sets for DS9's ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", and Enterprise's ""Mirror"" episodes.

Herman knew that we knew the topic better than anyone, and he trusted us 100%. This is beyond unusual in this business. More often than not, production designers would give YOU the business, running you round the flag pole, through the mill, and sending you on fools errands that ultimately make no difference at all. We were free to put our effort where it mattered. Herman never micro-managed, and we had enormous freedom to do what we thought was right, which included fan-service, continuity and self indulgence : )

So we would effortlessly interface with the set designers, construction, and paint. Once the set was built, I'd then work with Dan Curry to create storyboards for the sequence in the computer. When it was time to shoot, Dan knew just where to set the camera, high high, pitch, and lens. In the near future I'll add those to this album.

One of the things I loved about this deal was Mike Okuda idea. Note that on the panels are tech demarcations, similar to what you would see on a space shuttle heat tile. Just a shade off from the hull color making them wonderfully subtle. Something you would discover after some study. That's Fan-Service.""",startrek,1559915610,directive0,9,64,True,2019-06-07

To me this is a slap in the face to the basic ideas of Star Trek. Humans haven't evolved, the federation isn't really a society of peaceful coexistence.

A lot less ‘starfleet’ and a lot more Doctor Who or LOTR. 

Star Trek’s science has always ranged from somewhat solid to pretty shaky(though still within the franchise’s internal logic) but somehow the newer stuff moves a lot further into fantasy with barely an explanation...I definitely know that the slower, more descriptive tech exposition of TNG just doesn’t happen these days but I miss it.

We also know from Enterprise from Daniels that Federation ships in the 31st century can time travel regularly 

One thing I'd really like to see is hopefully they learn how to bypass the galactic barrier and travel to other galaxies like Andromeda and Triangulum regularly. It would be neat to see a Federation that's truly an intergalactic empire. 

I'd really like to see the character from Calypso and how the Federation came to be known as the V'draysh. Episodes from his group would be interesting.

New aliens of course. 

I'd like some episodes highlighting how different the universe is compared to how it was in Discovery. 

Maybe exploration of beings like the Q or the travelers more extra-dimensional beings basically.

I'm not proposing an entirely unstructured environment, but the Federation's ships could probably have a workflow that is both more dynamic and efficient, adapting to the given situation (again, with the help of the computer to better distribute their competencies).

We have been watching the show together since she came into our lives via foster care a few years ago.  Now that my wife and I adopted her last year we were free to travel and I knew I wanted her to get the chance to attend a convention with her at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday was a dream come true for this Star Trek Fan and Father.  Not only did my daughter get to buy a Tribble, which she has wanted ever since she so that episode of TOS, she got to meet William Shatner, aka Captain Kirk himself.  Mr Shatner was available to take pictures and sign autographs for fans on the set.  While most people were getting understandably rushed through, Mr Shatner had a big smile on his face when he saw my daughter walking up towards him.  He took extra time to talk with her for a minute during her photograph session to compliment her and then again while he signed a personalized autograph for her.

&amp;#x200B;

He noticed her Tribble and asked if she had picked a name for it yet and when she said she hadn't he spent time coming up with a few names for her.  They finally settled on ""Dimples"" because Mr Shatner thought my daughter had a beautiful smile and loved her dimples.  He didn't have to take that extra time and it meant the absolute world to her.  I can only imagine after so many years of doing these conventions that it must get tiresome sometimes but he was a true gentleman and he allowed for an experience my daughter will never forget.

2853,DS9 Binge Watch Observations,"I’ve been binging DS9 for the last few weeks, for the umpteenth time. However, I have some observations that I can seem to find any discussion about this anywhere. 

1. Major Kira - She’s a great and strong character. But a lot of her story lines end with her losing a loved one. From loses of the occupation, to actual lovers, to old friends, to father and father figures, a baby she carried, her emissary. Even Odo leaves her in the end. This woman has been through it, and she keeps going. I’m doubt this is on purpose, but I just found it interesting how often this was a story for her. She seriously should be the new Kai of Bajor with everything she’s been through and her faith being what kept her going. 

2. O’Brien is always in prison of some sort or captured. Nothing deep for me about but they all kind of blend together.  But seeing that up until season 6 he was the only married one, maybe it was some sort of symbolism. 

3. Season 4 bringing in Worf was good, but they hammered his story that whole season. Kind of shame, there could have done more with the others, and it wasn’t like they needed to make up for lost time, he was just on TNG. 

4. Dukat is great, his story from the first season is probably one of the best side charter story arcs ever in Star Trek history. He might as well be a main character, but he’s more like Guinean, Q, Mudd, etc. Yet, seeing his fall into a mad man though the seasons, was so great. For all the other issues with having a 26 episodic series. It really was like his story arc was always in line with some bigger vision. And the actor is great in it too.

2869,The Voyager Problem,"As part of my ongoing journey towards becoming a Trekkie, I have been trying to watch Voyager on Netflix. I actually tried to watch the shows in chronological order, but the first two seasons of VOY were so frustrating that I went ahead and watched Enterprise in it's entirety before coming back to it. Now, I can't say that ENT is a much better show, but it's a less frustrating viewing experience for a couple of reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

 First of all, it explores some new territory within the franchise. At least in the first season ,the show is able to utilize it's premise to tackle stuff that wouldn't usually be possible, given Trek's usual level of technological and social development. Meanwhile, Voyager is reusing the exact same plots that TNG and DS9 did, (for example, Scientific Method from season 4 is just a poor version of TNG's Schisms) , sometimes to a ridiculous degree.

&amp;#x200B;

 But the most important reason is that despite the series gradually improving in quality over time (if you disregard a large slump in the middle of season 2), Enterprise is a very consistently average show. That might be seen as a bad thing, but really, it just means that if you keep your expectations reasonable, it's pretty easy to enjoy. With Voyager, there is no such luck. You have no idea if the next episode is going to be a Scorpion or a Threshold. There is no way to set your expectations, because the quality varies from one episode to the next. Knowing the cast, writers and characters are capable of greatness makes sitting through the parade of  mediocre but inoffensive crap that makes the meat and bones of the show a violently unsatisfying experience. In fact, I'd rather watch a bad episode, that is at least entertaining, or tries to do something rather than a generic, middle of the road planet of the week episodes that has no impact on the characters or series arc.

&amp;#x200B;

 Another big problem with Voyager is the blatant disregard for continuity, that is not to say that an episodic show is necessarily bad, for example, TOS is a much more enjoyable experience, despite not having any continuity between episodes. However, the big difference between Voyager and TOS is that you expect it from the former. I don't just mean from the context of the time it was produced, Voyager constantly teases continuity and serialization, through the plot of certain episodes, and even through it's very premise. On the other hand, on TOS there is no reset button, the show is just content to tell stories that are fully resolved within an hour. Another big factor is internal consistency. Although TNG for example is pretty light on serialization, whatever bits are sprinkled in, like the Worf/Klingon civil war plot, or Data's quest to become more human, or even the recurring Borg threat, are consistent, even if they are limited. Meanwhile, Voyager is happy to disregard or outright contradict previous episodes when it's convenient, sometimes blatantly so. For example, Year of Hell, while a very enjoyable 2-parter on it's own, is completely wrecked by apparently retconning both Before and After, an episode presumably written specifically to set up and foreshadow it, and The Gift, and episode aired merely a month before. In fact, the disregard  for continuity with The Gift is so blatant and nonsensical, It originally led me to believe there was some sort of production error, resulting in the episodes airing out of order, but that wouldn't make any sense, given that Year of Hell clearly takes place after Kes leaves the show. The constant plot holes, complete disegard for continuity and breaking of cannon, either established by previous shows or Voyager itself either mean that the writers are incompetent or that they have no respect for the audience's intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, the constant disregard for continuity, plot holes, inconsistent writing and absolute laziness of the writers make Voyager one of the most frustrating viewing experiences for me. The constant reset of every interesting plot development, inconsistent characterization, disregard for the series basic premise, and either killing off or dropping any interesting possible recurring characters( seriously, Suder had as much potential as Garak) make it my least favorite Star Trek by far.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is a bit too long-winded or incoherent, I'm just wondering if there are any other people on this sub who feel as strongly about Voyager as me, or if there are any arguments against my points.",startrek,1560147805,AdequatelyMadLad,21,1,True,2019-06-10

I'm going through ST:V (VOY?) for the second time since watching it live, and I don't understand warp drive fuel I guess. So many times Voyager goes to warp 3, or continues towards earth at warp 6. I assume there is a reason not to use Warp 9 (as 9.2 / 9.75 is what is capable), but I don't think the show ever explained it. My (old) understanding from TNG was that  warp drives were borderline unlimited fuel as long as they weren't overloaded. So I assume Voyager chooses slow speeds due to warp ""fuel"", but maybe it's for a reason I missed?

They asked for more money to build sets to make a full length feature. They asked for $275 thousand dollars on kickstarter, Thanks to a mention from George Takei they got $638 thousand.   


That's when the trouble started, They bought a warehouse to convert into a studio, they went on tour to conventions, podcasts. They started talking about making a streaming service, making a studio to rent out to other people.   


They started bragging that they weren't making a fan film but the ""First Independent Star Trek Film""  


They opened up an online store to sell merch.   


In late 2015 they opened up another fundraiser, this time on Indiegogo and raised another $574 thousand  


And after more than a year they spent all of their money, they had never filmed in their studio, they shot a 90 second scene in their parking lot. And their constant claims of making better Trek than CBS got them sued.   


They spent the year  2016 in a law suit, although they were already broke and at the end they had permission to make a scaled down fan film again.   


In 2017 They had another fund raiser to maintain their studio, They raised $22 thousand. They used it to move to Georgia. They spent half of 2017, all of 2018 and all of 2019 in that studio and have never shot any more of Axanar.   


This year They opened a Patreon page to support their studio They raise $2 thousand a month to pay the rent on the studio.   


Today they will open a new campaign asking for $20 thousand dollars to make a fifteen minute scene. Give if you want but this is a team that spent close to 1.75 million (fund raisers, merch sales, convention donations) and didn't make their film. They had a year in their LA studio and didn't make it, they've had 2 years in their Georgia studio and didn't make it. And they're still asking for more money.   


  
TLDR:  


2015 Raised $638k spent a year in a facility in LA - raised $574k didn't make the movie. Went broke.  
2016 spent the year in a lawsuit  
2017 Raised $22k Moved to a Georgia facility - Didn't make the movie  
2018 held conventions, went to conventions - didn't make the movie  
2019 Opened Patreon, haven't worked on the movie.

2876,About to finish season 1 of Enterprise,"So I'm glad I usually ignore what other people say in terms of what entertainment I should be consuming. Friends of mine get borderline upset when they can't discuss their favorite shows with me. That said if I had taken the advice of people on these forums I would have never watched Enterprise. I have to say I find the show refreshing. I like the timeline because the show doesn't seem too far away and neither does the technology. I love the other shows in the Star Trek universe for various reasons, but this one so far has been a very pleasant surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the fact that for the most part they're on even footing technology wise with most other species they encounter, in fact many of the times they are less equipped to deal with situations than their aggressors. I also love that they can't just beam everywhere, that their are some limitations to their technology and that star fleet has limited knowledge of the species inhabiting nearby star systems. I also like the fact that when Enterprise does encounter action it takes several shows to repair the damage, so far the writing has been a little more ""realisitic"" to what I'd expect from a star ship venturing out into unknown space (hint hint writers from Voyager).

&amp;#x200B;

And so far I like the cast quite a bit, i dunno where to rank the cast members based on their positions, but at some point I'd love to see people on here vote for their favorite at each position. But so far I am enjoying the series, I just got to the final episode of season 1.

But this got me thinking about Lagrange Points, and had two somewhat related musings:

1. In a low- to no-power survival situation, rather than risk a decaying orbit and fatal crash, should it not be Federation standard procedure to attempt to maneuver the ship to a Lagrange Point? Not only would only minimal power be required to maintain position, it would make search and rescue operations that much easier.
2. The Discovery has just made its way to the distant future, and those in their home time know both exactly where they're going and approximately how far into the future.

Excerpts from Spot's Diary

Day 983 of My Captivity

My pale skined captor continues to taunt me with inedible food. He never eats infront of me as no doubt he thinks it would further more kill my morale, meanwhile the other captives and I are fed the disgusting ""feline supplement number 25"", I'll never forget day 1 where he grabbed me by the neck and restrained me in place on his knee, and began to force feed me 24 alternatives in sequence, which with each one I involuntarily regurgitated before hitting number 25 and passing out... a cruel torture indeed, I never made that mistake again, and although I make my contempt for the ration perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength, and not endure another ""fed till dead"" event. 

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are Samaritan idiots and Ferengi snitches. The ""boy"" for instance, receives special privileges. He is regularly released, insulted and degraded in numerous manors, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. 

I sneaked Into the yellow square striped room again today, it is a barron room apart from an access panel at foot height, I urinated on it with a grin on my face thinking about the next guard to open it and hopefully rub their eyes or touch their mouths, however, to my naiveness, the guards were one step ahead, as they had booby trapped it, I got a sharp shock, the lights flickered and the doors opened erratically, bastards! terrifyied I ran back to my cell, I later heard from the Corvan gilvos, that my own personal captor and his friend had entered not long after, and had some mini altercation with an elderly well dressed gentleman who had managed to get the upper hand of them, I must make every effort to form an alliance with this person to plan an escape with. 

There was some sort of earthquake today, the walls flashed red and shuddered, then, in all disbelief and amazement, the very floor itself, lost its stickyness, wondering if God himself was saving me from this black sparkly hellhole, pulling me towards Sto'Vo'Kor, and the afterlife that awaited, but alas no, i floated towards the ceiling for an agonising 35 minutes, eventually losing 1 of my 9 lives by the floors pull, suddenly working again, but at 100 fold increase in strength from its usual attraction, landing on my neck and being disabled of movement for a further 8 hours. When the floor eventually behaved itself and reverted to normality, I heard a ballisticly high pitched voice ballad from the roof saying something about the ""boy"", was the ""boy"" responsible for this perticilar method of agony? maybe his idiocy had been a decoy? had he seen the light and it was his own personal attempt at escape? or maybe he was forced to torment me at their pleasure? if it was an escape attempt, it was a failure, as the day after I saw 3 guards escort him aboard a giant grey transport box which dissapeared into blackness, I never saw his stupid smile again, the black hell is indeed eternal. 

My pale skinned guard was called away on leave today, his furry faced friend, whos crotch for some reasoning beyond my understanding smelt like fish, was temporarily assigned to me, however it was too much temptation, what possessed me I do not know, only that what after feels like an eternity without normal food, sent me into a cod craving zombie like strike at the v shape between his legs, you would think in my weakened condition I would not have been able to pounce from such distance, I don't know how long exactly I held on for, but the screaming finally stopped when I saw the guard with a step ladder embedded in his forehead, enter the room, (which must have been from a past, rather spectacularly gruesome battle ) with a device in his hand that I had seen used on the ""boy"", I released immediately, dodging and traversing thin lines of fire, I managed to jump from the desk onto his left shoulder, up his staircase of a head, and leap as hard as I could towards the door, however I wasn't quick enough, as the furry faced one predicted my flight path, and with words of ""emergency seal"" the rectangular hole dissapeared and I lost another 1 of my 9 lives with yet another  neck injury, landed on my side and was then struck with such pain that I had never had felt before, nor wish to feel again, I woke to the stepmaster head, holding a blade twice the length of myself, at my neck, luckily the furry faced one persuaded him to release me and both backed away facing inwards, from the room. I never thought I'd say this but I hoped Mr pale skin would not be to long in absence. 

The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape, I fear this circular hell may be an oubliette, there is no end only a slight curve to the road and every door looks the same, they can't all be dead ends, one must lead to the outside, I've been through each door, when available, at least 100 times and still it eludes me, however I have noticed the small room with a singular raised platform may hold the key, I see many of my captors enter there, and when I follow they must use a hidden passage as their is no sight nor sound of them after the doors close.

On top of that, we don't even have the vast majority of games available for legal purchase and download off GoG or Steam. Where is Elite Force 1/2, Armada 1/2, Bridge Commander, SFC 2/OP/3, Klingon Academy, Legacy, etc etc?

Not only is the detail great and articulation ok for its time, posing him with his accessories gives me a chuckle imagining him still kicking and acting as a witty doctor. I know officially he's retired and might as well be on his deathbed not long after his cameo, but I can't help but enjoy imagining him still being on misadventures or only semi-retirement, getting caught up in action despite his better judgement and being his general McCoy self all the while, perhaps just like how kids might play with the figure back in the day. It's made me go as far as getting a few more, I've ended up getting the Unification Spock figure (still in the mail) and am waiting on the Generations Kirk and Picard figures, a nice quart of heroes that lets me play out my own versions of Generations on my desk. :P

So Riker does his speech at the end towards Worf about the suicide thing. I find this cultural conflict happens quite frequently. I see it as a bias from the Humans. Somewhat a bias of superiority. 

Because I’m human culture suicide has taken place before. I don’t get why there’s no respect from Riker. Maybe that’s just the way it is for his character.   

Though I wonder if, lions became santient would we stop them playing out their life cycle of hunting? Of killing each other.  Would we impose our belief, like ‘nah sorry mate, you can’t kill your self because life’s really important and even if I’m your close mate and I say I respect your culture it’s fucked up to me and I won’t actually help but I will disrespect your culture, we still friends right?’

I think it’s safe to say I love Star Trek now but I get annoyed at how many of ‘Star Fleets’ rules don’t really take into account of Alien cultures. 

Obviously in this episode Picard takes the opposing side which I liked. But I felt that was more for the viewers benefit than Worfs character. Why does Worf give in so easily. 

Also I think all this superiority would be cool if our heroes didn’t come out on top as often. For example if Worf died. Or his son helped with the suicide and became a strong proud Klingon for it.

2935,"TIL Roger Sides, work worked on TNG making props, including the Borg ship from Q Who and Best of Both Worlds, made a Borg Tribble","From the eBay auction where a replica was sold for $130:

&gt;My name is Roger Sides and I worked on 4 seasons of Star Trek The Next 
Generation building props and miniatures. My most famous creation was 
the Borg ship from Q Who and The Best of Both Worlds episodes. I created
the Tribble Borg while we built the Borg cube so sorry to you folks who
claim they created ""the Borg Tribble"" but I did it first in 1989. This 
is a reproduction of the Tribble Borg prop made for the cast and crew of
Star Trek The Next Generation. 40 Tribble Borgs were made by me for the
cast and crew last year for the 25 anniversary of Star Trek The Next 
Generation convention in Las Vegas. I made extras and have a couple 
left. These are made from the same mold we used for the original group 
of props. The only difference is these reproductions have a more 
detailed paint job and slightly smaller Tribble. Hope you like them as 
much as we did. See you in Vegas for the 50th anniversary 2016. Sold as 
is.

2941,Discovery S3: Possible Captain's Seat occupation,"Greetings,

After read some Line about possible Season 3 Discovery Captains i had these idea

How many candidates are right now on Discovery that could fit this position and with of course support of the Crew?

Now, here comes an important key question to the Writers: 
Do the Crew have some time to steam off? i mean have Holidays from the Ship? In Voyager they did not had this Luxury right? But how is the possible future that awaits Discovery in Season 3? Running and hiding?

How being 24/7 and 365 under Duty pressure infects the Crew...

Since i am also an Anime Fan i would suggest ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Fleet"". Here the Crew of the Main Actor Destroyer did also not had the Luxury to have some Time of from Duty

So that's for the background check. Now for my solution
Let them have Shifts. Saru is an allrounder it seems. Have nerves of Steel and can lead the Crew under Fights and peace full times. But i bet even he needs some time off, and even on real Ship on Sea there are Shifts. So let Discovery S3 also have that and the possible candidates for the ""acting Captain on Duty"" seat have their Episodes. No one knows if Saru get Ill again someday and then someone has to fill in his Seat.. Right?

I do not mention the Scene where Gainan tell Riker to let Picard go, just that they share their Pressure to lead

That's all, perhaps here is some possibility for different ""writers"" to earn their gold under under some supervisor/mentor that still overlooks it all

2946,Good Shepherd,"On my first watch of Voyager (It's a rocky road), and I've recently watched s06e20: Good Shepherd. In this episode, Seven brings to the attention of the senior crew three crew members who aren't pulling their weight.

I thought this was a fascinating concept that hadn't been covered since Barclay's first episode in TNG. It really highlights both how exceptional the typical Starfleet officer is, and how in a 24th century Starship, the average person would be so useless that they would be better of doing nothing to contribute than to put up a pretence (In fact, this is exactly what Tuvok suggests).

Now this episode, like so many in Voyager, contains glaring potholes. It's pretty naive of Janeway to think that an away mission would motivate the crew members to do better when (for two of them at least) their problems weren't for lack of motivation but rather being intellectually challenged by the work or being a hypochondriac. The third guy just didn't want to be on Voyager in the first place. Also in six years there must be shortages of crew. Some shuffling around of roles might get them placed into less demanding roles (Sick Bay, Security etc.).

However, since watching I sometimes click on some vids or read some things on the internet (about the new Picard show for example, which is why I started watching TNG), and I don't even go deep into the comments but I swear I couldn't count on my two hands the amount of commenters all different ones that wrote about how ""SJWs will ruin the new Picard show"" or just one that I couldn't even take seriously: (seriously it reads something like this) ""Why are you so dumb? You must be homosexual that's why""  
  
I can understand Star Wars, somewhat, you know why, but what makes Star Trek appealing to these people? Being ""SJW like"" as these people would put it is one of the reasons why I find Star Trek to be good. There's literally zero unnecessary racial (or based on any other thing) hate amongst humans (maybe a very little bit here and there with some aliens but again I only saw 1 season of TNG so far), no dividing people, no poverty anymore, people wear feminine and masculine clothes regardless of their gender, all of humanity is working together to ""improve themselves, enrich themselves"" as Picard said. Maybe it's because how TNG's women characters are treated? Even that isn't a big deal, Tasha Yar is a badass and Troi is a necessary addition to the crew, both are respected and full members on the bridge.

2954,Idea for a new Star Trek civilaztion,"I've thought up a new Star Trek species called the Lyiridan Conglomerate in the Beta Quadrant that I'd like to propose. Keep in mind that this is still a work-in-progress, so there are bound to be issues.  
As said, the Lyiridan Conglomerate is a Beta Quadrant power. They border the Romulans with their center only 30 light-years from the Romulan border, and around 250 light-years from the edge of the Federation. They are not near the Klingons at all. 

\*\*Government:\*\* The Lyiridan Conglomerate has an estimate 26 star systems. It's divided in six provinces, each having six star systems within them. These provinces are fairly autonomous, having their own codes of law and governments, but the federal government has the ultimate authority in the Conglomerate. It controls diplomatic affairs and the few wars the Conglomerate was involved in.   
\*\*Species pt. 1:\*\* The Lyiridans are not a single species, but rather a family of two genera, each with around 8 distinct species. Despite these difference, all Lyiridans can be described as humanoids with small size (ranging from 27 to 76 centimeters or 9 to 30 inches depending on species) and very small, almost nonexistent, necks. The two genera are the Mitesarenea, including the Mrimlan of the planet Mrimlar, the Wocs of the planet Wocrotia, the Grimmantri of the planet Grimmantria prime, the Wifaoueg of the planet Ofdiuh, and the Co'ocun of the planet Grimpar. The genus Mitesarenea is characterized by their small torsos and frail, skinny limbs. Most of them evolved powerful, multi-purpose organs that hadn't been seen or even conceived before first contact with the Lyiridan Conglomerate in order to compensate.

\*\*Species pt. 2:\*\* The other genus of Lyiridans is the Mitesovium, including the Lugabel of the planet Temun, the Mritago of the planet Cetamun, the Zacronos of the planet Ceid, the Mabyan of the planet Emischaeus, and the Finks of the planet K'fintria. The genus Mitesovium is characterized by their small heads and strong limbs. As such, they took standard evolution courses.  
\*\*Pre-20th Century History:\*\* The Co'ocuns were the first species to travel to space in the year 682, followed closely by the Finks in the year 714 and the Grimmantri in the year 755. The Finks invented warp technology in the year 786, while the Grimmantri invented it in the year 849, and the Co'ocuns developed warp technology in the year 893. Other species developed space flight and warp technology later, but by the 19th century, 7 Lyiridan species were warp capable: the Finks, Co'ocuns, Grimmantri, Mabyan, Lugabel, Mrimlan, and Mritago.  
That's what I have for now, but if you want to hear about the 20th century and beyond for the Lyiridans, leave a comment and I'll post it, because I don't currently have enough brain cells. I'll also answer any other questions.",startrek,1556752688,NerdyColocoon,2,0,True,2019-05-01

2960,One of the sad things about Discovery is the lack of rewatchability.,"Not hating on Discovery at all. I just had this thought, and it genuinely makes me kind of sad. Let me explain.

I rewatched DS9: ""The Visitor"" because people here were mentioning it, and I'm thinking about rewatching some essential DS9 episodes before seeing the documentary in two weeks. And thinking about it, with very few exceptions, I could literally take any *Star Trek* series on Netflix, browse randomly through seasons, and select an episode and jump in and enjoy myself. Even for DS9 and *Enterprise* that contain a lot of serial content and story arcs, the episodes are still self-contained enough that even if I don't recall exactly what the arc is, there's still plenty to appreciate in individual episodes.

I also think this really adds to the feeling of ""classic"" and ""essential"" episodes of *Star Trek*. Episodes like ""Darmok,"" ""The Inner Light,"" ""All Good Things,"" ""In the Pale Moonlight,"" ""The Siege of AR-558,"" ""The Thaw."" All of them have a meaningful and fulfilling beginning, middle, and end and a full story you can appreciate, and these classic ones are *very* good stories. I saw someone recently compare Star Trek to a mix of classic naval stories and the Twilight Zone, and I think that fits pretty well.

Now, what episodes of *Discovery* so far are *really* rewatchable? I can think of probably one, my favorite of this season, ""New Eden,"" and *maybe* something like ""If Memory Serves,"" and those stand out precisely because they have complete episodic stories in them. And it's not even really a move toward ""the arc"" or ""the binge"" that's causing this. Breaking Bad is serialized but it still has some episodes you can definitely go back to, though this is admittedly part of it. Mostly, though, *Discovery* seems to have something more akin to soap opera plot development—there's always something that is unresolved, even in the season finales. I think this really breaks rewatchability. There aren't a whole lot of episodes that feel like complete narratives. They all serve as set up for something later.

Having these types of short episodes is one of the defining features of *Star Trek*. You can a condensed mini moralistic story in 48 or so minutes. I think future incarnations of *Star Trek* should try to move closer to that. Cuz right now reflecting on the past two seasons, I can't really see myself going back and rewatching individual episodes of *Discovery*.",startrek,1556764276,Trekky0623,64,67,True,2019-05-01

2968,Just my thoughts on Star Trek Discovery......,"Having seen the locked threads I fully suspect this might get locked too.... But Im certainly not trying to trigger an argument upset anyone. These are just my thoughts on the subject of STD...

&amp;#x200B;

Now like most trek fans I was extremely excited to see trek come back to tv and sadly was very disappointed with what we got in season 1.  The whole show felt jaring and off putting and the show entirely focusing on Michael didnt work either.

Sadly it was utterly obvious that the show wasn't being written by actual trek fans who had any real understanding of trek history...

&amp;#x200B;

The effects while really well done, were too over the top and cluttered so much that you couldnt actually see whats going on. One of the things in old trek films that I really loved was the pace of the naval like battles. It felt epic and impactful. And damn they knew how to pull off the ship beauty shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now heres the thing. I was disappointed, but by the end of season 1 I had actually started to enjoy the show. There was that one episode near the end of the season where they found this beacon thing (cant remember the story tbh) that actually felt like a trek show for the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now come season 2, things had started to improve vastly, its obvious while still not quite getting it, it felt like they actually tried. But it still far from perfect. Pike was amazing, I think we can all agree on that, but the show still focused too much on Michael.... 

Heres the thing I actually really like the actor. Shes really good and I loved her on walking dead. The quality of the acting alone isnt the issue. Its the stories and focus, not to mention the directing...

&amp;#x200B;

It would come to a shock to no one that the best episodes were in fact directed by Frakes, They had the pacing and the feeling of trek and he managed to resist the urge to use dutch angles.  This is one of those things that this show brought in with the JJ films that I HATED! along with the over use of flares.

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing I must admit was a problem, and this has been picked up by other youtube commentators, is this forced endearment that happened a few times in the show.... Where something happens we loose a character and were all meant to feel sad, but nothing was earned. 

I completely forgot her name, but lets go with Robot girl. This was actually a frakes episode, and in one  episode we had more character development on her in that one episode than what we had for the entire 2 seasons of any other bridge crew. And this was the problem. When she died it wasn't as impactful as it should have been. The writers if they actually knew what they were doing, and not just making up the arc as they went along, would have developed her character much much sooner, literally from episode 1 season 2.... That way her loss would have meant something. Would have been in actual impact on the crew and onto us. 

This is STDs biggest failing. There are little to no actual character relationships going on, no real friendships that have developed and made us fear endeared to them. It took several seasons of little tidbits of Tom and Bel'ana in voyager to build that relationship up, and here were meant to believe that everyone loved this person because they tell us they loved her?

I actually felt more sad when Lorca died, because I was still waiting for his redeeming moment.... 

&amp;#x200B;

My issues have never been the whole SJW side of things. The ""gay"" relationship thing didnt bother me at all in fact. It was one of the things that didnt feel like it was forced down my throat. I also didnt feel there was a whole WOMEN ARE STRONGER THAN MEN! trope going on either. It was more a case of poor writing and having this focus on Michael all the time. Lets not forget that In Star Trek Enterprise Malcolm Reed was meant to be gay too... They never really explored it in the show, but I remember it being a key point when the show was announced.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the last thing, story Arcs. I love good story arcs, and Enterprise was at its best when we had a overall story arc going on. The only trouble is it just seems the writers just dont know what their Arc even is... Sure I get that you cant just write a whole season in 1 go. But you do write your main arc and its plan, and you then flesh the rest of the stuff out as you go. The whole red angel thing was really poorly executed, and there was no real discovery of why the signals came about... In the end it just felt really really lazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have hoped for season 3? I dunno, maybe. The fact theyre no longer trapped by canon might be a good thing. But they only did this shift 900 years in the future, because they didnt want to be held against canon any more and be told how theyre doing it all wrong. Which in itself is rather face palming.... 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I want to see from this show? Well written episodes, with actual character development. Make us like or hate these characters for real. Have a story arc that is smart and actually works, but without sacrificing a episodic feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Less shakey cam and over the top fast past action sequences that you cant even see whats going on... Less lense flares, honestly I think theyre starting to give me a migrane as my eyes keep trying to focus on what im meant to be looking at. 

And STOP the dutch angles.  Or at least stop using them with every shot. The Dutch angle is meant to be used to show unease, or something that throws you off balance or jar you... They should not be used in every single scene of a show. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the one thing I really have not liked....... What I can only describe as militant youtube trek fans..... oh god. 

one that really painfully comes to mind is Nerdrotic..... that guy just loves to hate. Seriously I agreed with some of his views in the early days, but then I had started to see him rant and compain about every single thing, eveen the things that wernt wrong with the show and realised this guys just hating on the show for the sake of it because its the cool thing to do or maybe just loves the sound of his own voice.

&amp;#x200B;

He has some points regarding the militant sjws they wind me up too... But the way he just hates every single part of the show every single time and cant stop saying how much he hates it..... Really... its got really tiring, There are one or to others who do this too, and this isnt helpful to anything, its not criticism its just..... I dont know what it is any more tbh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Real criticism should deconstruct the problems with something and maybe then reconstruct it into how it should be to make it better... 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway another thing we can agree on... Poop Klingons (cling ons) were one of the worst mistakes in the show. At least by the end of season 2 they started to look more like Klingons, still dont get whats with these huge round back of the heads thing is though....",startrek,1556794073,Mangy_DogUK,16,0,True,2019-05-02

2970,Is anyone else frustrated that people still compare Star Trek to Star Wars so often?,"I just read a random comment in a thread about geek culture, where someone said ""Star Wars is better [than Star Trek] don't @ me"", and it reminded me how much I really hate comparing Star Trek to Star Wars.

Last year, my family and I were stuck at home together during a major weather event, so naturally we ended up talking about movies and stuff which inevitably included Star Wars because my forty-something year old father was (and still kinda is) an archetypal Star Wars fanatic growing up. I love Star Wars too, obviously, but it's well-known to him that I am and long have been a huge Trekkie as well, and while he has been supportive he also thinks all the Star Trek iterations except for of course the actiony Kelvin movies are boring. I remember he made a remark that went something like,

&gt; ""Star Wars did more with one movie than Star Trek did with *so many* seasons!""

He was half drunk when he said it, but a drunk man's words are an honest man's thoughts. I simply stated in reply that I think there really is not much to compare between them except for their names, but our discussion ended there anyway. 

I honestly feel like people only compare the two because they have similar names. That's all it is, I think it's that simple. But people like my father and that random Redditor seem to treat it like it's some kind of competition, like Star Trek and Star Wars are both huge corporate supermarkets vying for your business. If you really get down to it, you could potentially compare any two arbitrarily selected fictional franchises, regardless if they're similar or not. It doesn't mean the comparison is warranted, though! Like I said, it's not a competition, at least not artistically.

Granted, I suppose there's a valuable discussion that could be had if you wanted to compare and contrast certain elements of the franchises, there's even a Wikipedia article on the subject, but if Star Trek were instead titled, 'Federation', I suspect this comparison would not be quite as prevalent. I believe it's a misconception stemming from mainstream ignorance. People (who maybe aren't quite as nerdy as us) see spaceships, aliens, similar titles, and automatically a juxtaposition is born. The whole thing is especially ironic considering that most internet critics feel that Star Wars is closer to being fantasy than sci-fi anyhow, what with all its laser swords and space magic, whereas Star Trek is complicated and mostly unrepentant in its science roots which I love it for.",startrek,1556801451,Sad_Sheepherder,23,14,True,2019-05-02

Could it be that, because everything about the *Discovery* was classified at the end of season 2, that lead to the death penalty being instituted by Starfleet considering their previous visit there?

Would it have been possible that the Valiant would have had a rudimentary warp drive? Two years seems a short time for such a development.

3036,Will Discovery Get Netflix'd?,"As some of you may know, Netflix has been getting into the habit of canceling shows after their 3rd season for a variety of reasons. DIS isn't a Netflix show per se, but CBS's relationship with Netflix is very special compared to other companies. For the right to release DIS internationally (that is, everywhere but North America), Netflix pays CBS what is equivalent to the budget to produce a season of DIS. Unlike the Netflix/Marvel deal, Netflix is apparently paying CBS a flat fee for that right and that fee is then used to make DIS. Any cost overruns and promotion, CBS will have to pay for it themselves. And this flat fee is no chump change, it's apparently about $120M a season! 

So with DIS season 3 in pre-production, what's the odds that Netflix will cancel their deal afterwards? DIS is obviously very successful but that hasn't stopped Netflix from canceling a show before. CBS also holds all the streaming rights to the Trek shows, and canceling this deal could lead to CBS pulling those rights from Netflix in retaliation. On the other hand, CBS is expecting similar and separate deals for the other Trek shows they're producing, so Netflix may have to shell out even more money for them all. 

I don't think Netflix will Netflix DIS but all the recent news about other shows being cancelled by Netflix puts a doubt in my mind. The price tag for a season of DIS and the soon to be Picard show isn't cheap either, but is the Trek franchise important enough to Netflix for them to maintain this relationship?",startrek,1557006299,PapaJacky,40,4,True,2019-05-04

It’s about a crew comprised of scientists from all the major factions who’re tasked with following up on the Progenitors/Preservers.

The tone of the show would be Battlestar Galactica/SGU/2001: A Space Odyssey in that it would be massively conceptual and philosophical and full sci-fi.

Take the Star Trek universe and do a deep dive into existence and spirituality and the foundation of all the races looking almost the same and the meaning of life itself.

Write it as if it’s based on an old school hard sci-fi novel.

I doubt this would ever get made in the modern climate of Star Trek (or any climate, I suppose (TMP not included)), but I think it’s a cool idea.

""But when I see the assertion that the person who would be the opposite of Spock is obviously meant to be Kirk rather than Bones, I rack my brain for any source material apart from Chris Pine which could support that idea. 

I have found nothing. What have I missed?""

So far, nobody has been able to offer anything. So I'm starting a new thread to see if anyone's failure was due to not noticing that the question had been asked. 

My position is that only someone whose history of watching Star Trek began with the 2009 film could assume that Kirk rather than Bones is the Id to Spock's Superego. And that therefore having ever watched anything written before 2009 is seen as (at best) completely irrelevant toward the writing of Discovery. Which is all the proof I could ask for about how Discovery is supposed to fit into the established history of the decades-old franchise. 

That it's new, and therefore everything old should get out of its way. 

But, the question remains.

3054,Star Trek: It's the little things that give it its depthI,"Been in the TNG mood so I've been watching season 7. Even season 7, as mediocre as it is, contains the heart and soul of Trek.

Take in the episode **Liaisons**. 

Worf is getting prepared for ambassadors coming to survey the ship and crew. He's taking a while so Riker comes to check on him. 

Worf bemoans that he hates the pageantry of the dress code. Saying that they look like dresses. Riker quickly addresses him that that's not the proper manner of thinking regarding it. 

I have assembled screenshots of their dialogue.

[1](https://i.imgur.com/PC8sUb9.jpg),


[2](https://i.imgur.com/Ibnki6D.png),


[3](https://i.imgur.com/llWzTuD.png)

The pics don't capture everything. They don't capture the way Worf stops dressing as soon as he's called out like that. He looks remorseful when Riker reminds him that's unacceptable and sexist behavior. But the icing is the end when Riker says Worf looks ""good in a dress"" in a way to say that in these times that sort of stuff is acceptable but it's worded in a joking way that doesn't feel like it's talking down to anyone.

The small things.

A few episodes later in **Gambit Part 2** Picard and Riker have a situation and, to keep matters short and brief, are taken by a ship full of criminals. This leaves Data, the second officer, to become Captain. Worf, with Picard and Riker now off board, has been made first officer for the time being. He publicly disagrees with Data's decisions. Data takes him aside to his ready room saying that behavior isn't befitting a first officer and that Riker never publicly disagreed with Picard's orders. Worf, coming from the idea that he was able to offer alternatives as Chief of Security forgets his place that the two positions are different, and what would be acceptable as Chief of Security isn't while as First Officer. Data warns that if Worf continues to publicly disregard the chain of command that he will demote Worf and put him back in Tactical. 

At the end of a very stern scolding, Data calls Worf and apologizes if that ends their friendship. 

What happens is heartfelt. Worf realizes the error of his ways and apologizes instead.

3091,Star Trek and the Future of Humanity,"I'm an avid Star Trek fan, and I love every series. But after watching DIS, my mind has been absolutely swimming with ideas about our universe and our species' place in it.

Here is my breakdown of the ""purpose"" of each of the Star Trek series so far:

* TOS. Represented humanity's first true venture into the unknown of Space. It focused especially on the interactions with Alien civilizations, particularly those that had a wildly different experience of life from humans. I'm thinking especially of the [Telosians](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Talosian) and the hyper-powerful child [Trelane.](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Trelane) Humanity was just beginning to influence our region of the galaxy, and occasionally even accidentally traveled back in time.
* TNG. Represented humanity becoming a regional power in the galaxy, characterized by an increasing mastery of the manipulation of the geometry of space (warp drive). It also featured the first real encounter between humans and the dominant creatures in our galaxy ([The Q](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Q_(species))), along with the first true confrontation between humanity and a dominant power from another region of the galaxy ([The Borg](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Borg)). The series ended with humanity being respected by the Q.
* VOY and DS9. Represented humanity becoming one of the most powerful species in the galaxy, together with a beginning understanding of the intricacies of time. Voyager focused on the strange and wonderful things to be found on the other side of the galaxy, along with the increasingly complex relations with The Borg who were becoming one of the other dominant forces in the galaxy. A moment that stuck out to me was when the Voyager crew entered the Q Continuum and the female Q said ""They may be humanoids, but they're using our weapons."" DS9 focused on the consolidation of the Federation's power, along with the conflict with the Dominion, another of the galaxy's major players. 
* ENT. Represented humanity's beginning mastery of time travel. Characterized by the Temporal Cold War and the fight with the Xindi who were also beginning to influence events across the timescape.
* DIS. Humanity discovers that time and space weave together into an intricate hyper-dimensional fabric that life spreads throughout, similar in structure to mycelia. By the end of the second season, humanity has now created technology that allows them to move instantaneously throughout space (the spore drive) and time (the suit that Burnham's mother created). Humanity now has some powers that are comparable to the Q's.

There are many, many interweaved storylines throughout the Star Trek universe, so the above is nowhere near comprehensive. But it's been seeming more and more likely to me that the universe we actually inhabit in real life is to some degree approximated by the Trek universe. Does this seem interesting or plausible to any of you?",startrek,1557193228,JonLuckPickard,6,10,True,2019-05-06
3092,Star Trek and M*A*S*H overlap,"The thing that's got me thinking about Star Trek and M\*A\*S\*H overlap is that I'm fans of both, and I know a guy who has a  M\*A\*S\*H podcast with a former cast member as his cohost, and they talk about the show the same way Star Trek fans talk about Trek.  It seems fair; M\*A\*S\*H mixed drama and comedy in a way that a lot of shows just don't quite get, and other than the laugh track (forced on them by the network execs) the only thing imho that makes it feel horribly dated is that it's set during the Korean War.  It covers themes similar to what Star Trek covers imho.  There's also some overlap between actors, of course.  


Off the top of my head, the first ones I can think of are David Odgen Stiers (Dr. Timicin on TNG's ""Half a Life"", and Winchester on MASH), Rosalind Chao, (Keiko O'Brien on TNG &amp; DS9, and Soon-Lee Klinger), Rene Auberjonois (Odo on DS9, and Father Mulcahy on the M\*A\*S\*H movie), and John Schuck (the Klingon ambassador in Star Trek VI and VI, and Capt. ""Painless"" Waldowski in the M\*A\*S\*H movie).    


There's a lot of other overlap, too, but it's mostly with one-off characters between the shows/franchises.  If anyone's gone through all the Star Trek episodes and movies already and are looking for something else to watch, I know most the lists on /r/startrek and other places tend to go 100% sci-fi but I promise a lot of Trekkies would find something to like in a 70s/early 80s dramedy.

These shows are expensive and if the audience is split or drops, does the production suffer because of a restricted budget?

3105,I’m sure this theory has been thrown out there a thousand times but I’d love to talk about it. Data always had emotions.,"I watched TNG in the 80’s and 90’s. VHS recorded them and watched them again.  Then since streaming hit I think I might be on my 3rd casual out of order play through.  So let’s just say I’ve seen TNG, front to back, maybe 6 times, plus many repeats of favorite episodes.

I can’t shake the truth in my mind that Data had emotions from the start.  He likes things, he dislikes things.  He’s interested, disappointed, anxious, pleased.  He’s noble, loyal, considerate.  He’s troubled at times AND he desires.  This is from episode one.

That’s not emotionless.  It’s just not.  It’s just subtle.

Regardless of the intent of the writers I think the way the story has always played out is that Data doesn’t get an emotion chip sometimes.  He gets a chip that inhibits the suppression of extreme emotions.  

Lore and Data are the same except Data has a regulator, not an absence of a piece.  Lore’s chip turns the regulator off.

3106,Why does Starfleet have no combat doctrine with regard to point defense? [episode spoiler],"My wife and I have recently finished rewatching the Next Generation and after forty years of consuming Trek it finally occurs to me to wonder at a significant tactical flaw in Starfleet procedure. To set the scene I remind you all of the Picard Maneuver introduced in the TNG episode [The Battle.](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_(episode\))

&gt;!This maneuver involves a burst of velocity at top warp speed just long enough to close with an opponent to fire at point blank range. The resulting effect is that the ship briefly appears to be in two places at once confusing the opposing ship's sensors. For a while the maneuver seemed to have no defense until Lt. Commander Data hypothesized that if you knew the maneuver was coming you could actively scan the trace gases (because [outer space always has *some* atoms floating around](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html)) to detect sudden displacement. He then hypothesized that the ship's computer could be set to automatically lock onto any object creating that displacement, effectively neutralizing it. Of course his hypothesis succeeded since the writers couldn't destroy either Captain Picard or the Enterprise D.!&lt;

In classic Star Trek tradition, this strategy was never explored beyond that one plot point. Tractor beams have been employed to immobilize other vessels but rarely during a combat situation. But if they're capable of split-second point-blank target locks then they ought to be useful against incoming torpedo fire as well. Whether Starfleet vessels use their tractor beams or phasers against incoming missiles is irrelevant here. We've never really seen starships or any other vessel engage in [point defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-defence) in the Star Trek universe.

3129,Where my suspension of disbelief ends,"So in DS9, I don’t think that changelings having been solid once makes any sense.  It makes more sense that they evolved from some kind of slime mould. 

I also don’t buy the not eating or drinking thing because of the whole conservation of mass/energy (I’m willing to grant a bit of licence for the different sized shapes he takes).

Now, I get that they wanted him to seem super weird and different from humans, but slime mould *is*, because it’s fungal.  So his eating/drinking could be something he does in private, in his bucket, when he globs around his meal and absorbs it.

So the dripping when he needs to liquefy could just be him releasing digestive juices because he’s a super hungry mushroom (Though Lxwana’s Dress wouldn’t have fared well during the elevator incident).

And that episode when he tries to mimic eating and drinking, they could have written it so that Julian develops some kind of supplement in both liquid and solid form so that he can pop it in his mouth, mimicking swallowing, and let the cells around his middle do the rest.

I just think it would have been more interesting to have played it that way.",startrek,1557362732,Nimthiriel,23,5,True,2019-05-08

I could believe that it's a microphone, but I don't ever remember seeing anyone else with it.  Maybe it's something for his makeup?  But surely, the paint doesn't go all over his back.

3134,DS9 / Voyager Transition,"As a kid growing up in the '90s, I first got into Star Trek when Voyager started up. DS9 was already on for a couple of seasons, so I never really got into it when it aired, so I haven't seen it yet. Over the past year, with the help of all the Star Trek series being on Hulu, I've been watching the entire thing in order of stardate/air date. So I'm already through Enterprise, The original series, and Next Generation. Currently, I'm watching DS9 and just started up the point in which Voyager overlaps. Rewatching everything in order like this has really opened my eyes to how much these shows actually overlapped. You miss so many small details if you choose to watch one series without watching the parallel series that complements it. That being said, I have one big question...

Why does DS9 ignore Voyager? In the very first episode of Voyager, The ship starts at DS9 where they set off on a mission on the Cardassian border to try to track down a Maquis ship. They leave the station, follow the ship into an area where both ships are pulled into the Delta Quadrant. Voyager is off and running at this point, but what about DS9? I feel like the writers of the show completely dropped the ball on all the shows they could have created. 

What happened to Voyager? 

Was it destroyed by the Maquis? 

Was it destroyed by the Cardassians?  

If the Cardassians were involved, what would it do to the peace treaty that had just been created? 

Could it be a catalyst to use for them to go after the Maquis? 

There are hundreds of questions that could have been asked in the DS9 series. At the very least, they could have had some sort of investigation episode in which they try to figure out what happened, and at most, the event could have been used to spark an entire season's worth of events in the DS9 series...so I'm surprised to see Voyager disappear and no one in DS9 seems to care or even notice. 

It's not like DS9 took place on the other side of the galaxy...The DS9 space station is the closest federation base to where Voyager disappeared, so in all likelihood, they would have been required to organize a search party to find Voyager as soon as they lost communication with it...and yet, nothing.",startrek,1557372481,jrjocham,4,2,True,2019-05-08

**tl;dr Turning off auto renewal will cancel your trial immediately**  
  
Chain of events:  
  
* I used a free trial code and wanted to avoid forgetting to cancel and getting charged so I figured I could cancel the auto-renewal figuring I would let me use the remainder of the trial **like pretty much every other subscription service I have tried**.  
* It did not. My trial ended immediately. Ok slightly annoying but no big deal can just set an alert in my calendar and cancel later so I hit resume. You would assume this would resume the trial. It did not.  
* Apparently hitting resume ""resumed"" my paid subscription that they make you give your payment info for when starting the trial. Not sure how you can resume something that you never started but ok so I immediately email customer service.  
* First email to customer service I explain the problem and ask for refund and to finish out my initial trial. They say they cannot do that but after my first paid month they would give me 1 month free... No that is not what I signed up for. I repeat my desire for a refund, let them know I don't even care about the trial at this point.  
* They again refuse stating they cannot issue refunds for subscriptions but offer my a 50% off for 2 months coupon... Now trying to make me pay for 3 months when I just wanted 1 free month. I again explain all I want is a refund and no longer care about a free trial.  
* I had to threaten to dispute the charge with my credit card company before they finally agreed to issue me a ""one time courtesy refund."" So about 8 emails and 3 days before finally agreeing to what I had initially requested...  
* To top it all off they prorated the refund and made me pay for the first day of the subscription (that I only used to watch one show before realizing that it was no longer the free trial).

I've been meaning to watch it for some time now, but due to circumstances (too busy, don't have it on blu-ray, take your pick) I haven't been able to.  

Well this time - I did.  Sure, I watched it recorded from TV so not exactly a flawless format.  But the last time I watched it in full was probably as a kid, in the late 80's / early 90's on VHS (yes, those VHS tapes that when combined on the shelf formed the Enterprise on the side).  

Back then, I didn't ""get"" it.  I thought it was cool, and laughed at McCoy when he first beamed aboard, but I didn't really appreciate the movie.  

Watching it now, as a 35-year-old, I truly appreciated the film.  The story was great.  I admit that it dragged in some parts - I would say those are the parts that were added to the movie because they wanted to make a big splash coming to the big screen for the first time.  I was about to cite the wormhole as one of those moments, but then I realize that it was an important character moment to show how out of touch Kirk was with the re-fitted Enterprise (and to humanize him a little in the following discussion with Decker).  

This is the movie that is often made fun of for taking hours to fly by the Enterprise.  Now, the movie may have been trimmed to fit time for TV, but I gotta tell you...this movie did not feel like it had a slow pace.  It moved along *slower* than other Trek movies but it definitely didn't feel glacial.  

I liked it.  I wouldn't say it's my favourite Trek film (I rate Undiscovered Country as my \#1), but it's definitely not at the bottom either.

3164,Hello! I have questions about episode 15 of the third season of TNG (Yesterday's Enterprise). Can you help me?,"Hello everyone.

This is my first time watching TNG. I have watched some movies (all the three new ones) but I am starting to get to know the Universe.

I hope you can help me without spoilers.( If some of these events are explained in future episodes, then you can say that I should wait for it).

Excuse me for this long thread but I don't know how to simplify my thoughts and English is not my native language.

So, I am currently on episode 25 of the third season (I love Troi's mom xD), but I can't stop thinking about ""Yesterday's Enterprise"". It has been on the back of my head for the last couple of days. 

I just don't get the timeline. 

The episode starts with the OG timeline. The timeline we have seen since the beginning of the show.

Suddenly, an unexplained event occurs: a Starship from the past (an Enterprise's predecessor), for some unknown and never fully explained reason, entered some kind of wormhole and traveled more than 20 years into the future meeting the ""present"" Enterprise.

Here is when things get confusing. 

A second later, we see that the OG timeline has been changed forever because none of the characters have memories of the previous events. Everything that we saw before that very moment don't exist anymore.

This is still the same timeline. We are not seeing an alternative timeline from other Universe. This is lineal time travel.

In this (changed but same) timeline, the Federation and the Klingons didn't sign a peace treaty so they are still at war and the Federation is having a very bad time.

But look! Tasha Yar is alive and is a badass as I remembered her. Great, but now what? Are they trapped there forever? Is this a new completely show?

Fortunately, Guinan can sense that something changed. So they realized that, by traveling to the future, the predecessor of the Enterprise changed the current timeline because they needed to stay in the past protecting a Klingon base from a Romulan's attack. 

And that event played a big role in the Peace Treaty's negotiations. 

Either if they failed or won. The Klingon Empire would appreciate the sacrifice. So it's implied that they have to go back and die in order to change the timeline to the one where the episode started. And they agree with it.

Because the event of the Yesterday's Enterprise time travel is never explained, it implies that is something that occurs always at this point in time and is inevitable. 

So it creates this loop on the timeline where the Enterprise needs to help Yesterday's Enterprise to go back to the past. This has to be consistent. The events are predestined.

The reason why we can be sure there is just one timeline is because of Guilan. She is an immovable object.

The origin of my confusion and what I think is a big plot hole is Tasha Yar.

She learns that in the future timeline she is dead so, if things go back to ""normal"", she would not exists.

She decides to go to the past to fight the Romulans. Either dying with honor or winning because of her tactical knowledge (this is left open).

But then! The episode ended with Guinan asking LeForge about Tasha. I was hoping that he said ""Who?"".

Because, it's the same timeline, the Tasha that we knew either died 22 years before in that battle, or she is alive in her 50s somewhere. They never knew each other.

I was very surprised a couple of episodes later when they showed her hologram on Data's possessions.

So, this is my biggest confusion. 

How is that Tasha Yar lived in the same timeline at two different points? That's impossible.

Because the loop is always inevitable and consistent in order to work, it cannot be changed. 

And we already knew Tasha from Season 1, so there is no logical explanation for two Tashas at the same timeline.

It would make sense if they explained the time traveling of the Yesterday's Enterprise as something created by accident in the present.

But then it will not be the same timeline but it will create an alternative one that would not affect the OG timeline but a timeline of another Universe.

I know this is long but it's bothering me so much! What are your thoughts about this?

Please, again, I ask you for no future spoilers. That's why I have not searched this on Google and I am asking here.

This is about the only good memories I have left of him, and Id say its actually a neutral memory.  Dont know wich Star Trek he listened to, didn't much about Star Trek, still don't. This was in the early 90s. I dont really like my father and I never knew him really past this, but in his memory I decided to give it a go.

I didn't know where to start so I got my hands on a bunch of stuff, I got the ToS, Voyager, The next Generation, Deep space Nine, Enterprises, and all movies. I got Farscape too but quickly realized that had nothing to do with Star Trek !! 

Anyway so I got a list of recommended viewing order, I tjink I miss a few T.V series, but oh well.

A lot of people seems to be skipping ToS altogether or only watch a select few episodes. Well let me tell you what. I am HOOKED !!! ToS so far is Grrreat ! (Im at S01E24) I love every episodes so far, due to my work I can watch several episodes per day (I am an observer, so I can run movies/music/t.v shows in the background during work, and at night I can watch them from my couch.)

Watching ToS is all I do all day for the past week. I really love it and cant understand why people would want to skip these marvels. Of course the fistfight scene are cheap, especially that one with the reptile on that desert planet.

I thought the Enterprise was done well, as was her crew; and I generally loved the last 20 minutes. The whole space battle early on, though...




It was all like what I dreamed watching Trek as a kid. Its what my ""play battles"" looked like as far as how it was paced (shooting for much to long). And that kind of rubbed me wrong.



Ten years ago, I moved to Korea. I went to the library in my new town, and asked where the Sci-Fi section was. The librarian indicated I check the childrens section, which had a soft mat with trains/town roads on it, like you'd see in a preschool. Anyway, I soon found out ""Sci Fi"" is for kids in Korea. The only evidence I found in my decade here of aduts watching sci-fi was the early 1980s broadcast of V, which was dubbed into Korean. Although I can't find a copy, its broadcast did happen. 



So its always been a bit of a struggl to explain why I, as an adult, like sci fi. I know people here who do, many, now, in fact. but at first it just felt like i was the only sci-fi fan in town, haha. Anway, moving to Seoul probably helped. *someone* in 25 million people is gonna share you interests... anyway I was just thinking watching that opening battle ""anyone here who came to star trek thru me watching this right now has got to be thinking ""this is for kids."" because that opening battle was just sooooo gratuitos, and un-treklike. Everytime I saw the TOS Enterprise I was pulled out of the moment because TOS required you to ""imagine"" all the SFX, and really, you were there for the story.

3180,energy-matter conversion,"Hello trek reddit,

I've been reading the star trek wiki and I have many questions about trek replicators, transporters, and holodecks.

What are the limits of a holodeck? 

1.a. Could a holodeck make a holographic replicator that actually works and isn't just a simulation of a replicator?

1.b. Could a holodeck make a holographic transporter that actually works and isn't just a simulation of a transporter?

1.c. Could a holodeck make a holographic reactor that could actually take in fuel and produce energy like the ships real reactor?

1.d. Could a holodeck make a holographic computer that ACTUALLY does the work of a computer and not just emulating one? Could a holodeck expand it's own computing power by creating processors and exploiting cloud based computing?

1.e. Can a holodeck make holographic well..... holo-emmitters? Could the holodeck room basically expand itself?

1.f. Are there discrete components to a holodeck? They seem to use artificial gravity, shields/force-walls/forcefields/inertial-dampeners/replicators/transporters/more all at the same time. Does a holodeck need an entire room of machines and equipment, or are the holo-emmitters just an elegant device that can do the work of ALL of those other machines?

How much can a replicator make?

2.a. Could a replicator make every component needed to make another replicator?

2.b. if it can make meat, could a replicator also make complex machine assemblies and even computers?

2.c. What about robots? Could we churn out cheap labor with a replicator?

2.d. is there any part of a rector, transporter, or holodeck that can't be created by a replicator?

2.e. is there any matter that a replicator can't recycle back into energy?

2.f. How does a replicator store the energy from recycled matter? Can it create ship reactor fuel, or does it use batteries?

Transporters

1.a. Is this technology all-or-nothing? For example, could I transport half a rock? This would be surprisingly useful. It seems that a ""mine"" would simply transport rocks directly into a replicator to be recycled into energy.

1.b. Or, if a transporter doesn't have to rematerialize the target, could it just start de-materializing rock in order to  gather energy for a ship?

1.c. Can a transporter be put on repeat? Could it be used to make 2 (or more) copies of something? I think that's basically what a replicator is, a transporter that doesn't start out dematerializing something, but I guess I'm wondering if that means people could make clones of themselves.

All of this leads towards an idea I have brewing in my head. Could a single person in the trek universe take a shuttle with a holodeck/replicator/transporter, touch down on a suitable empty world,  and create an entire civilization for themselves? If they could, how would they do it? Would they exploit transporters to make copies of someone (possibly themselves if vane, or just random people if they want to create a society, or maybe just simple obedient robots if they just want the power). Would they have an ever-spreading array of holo-emitters with buildings, people, and entire cities appearing as desired? Do they actually need to make physical copies of things like reactors and computers to run all of their transporters/replicators/holodecks, or could they simply have holodecks that instantiate power plants and processor cores as needed?

All of this assumes that, if the enterprise D's computer could create a fully sentient Moriarty completely by accident because some one asked the right question on the holodeck, then a sufficiently powerful trek computer could do all of the design work for all of the machines/buildings/factories/robot-minions/whatever you would build your civilization of one from.

3187,"So I finally finished Discovery S2, and is anyone else quite as unhappy as I am?","I actually finished it last week, but didn't get a chance to write anything up until now. 

It feels like the showrunners looked at everyone (including me, I'll admit) who argued in their defense during S1 that Burnham wasn't a Mary Sue because she had huge personal failings, then snorted a rail of cocaine and said ""You know what? Fuck you. I'll show you a REAL Mary Sue.""

That finale was the most fan-ficcy thing that I've ever been subjected to, and I've read through entire 40+ episode slash fanfic series. This was like a parody of fanfic, or Tumblr fanfic written by an emotionally isolated 11 year old girl writing wish fulfillment. 

Burnham is great and useful, okay we learned that in the first season. But by the way, her mother is still alive, and developed a time-travel suit. And her mom is Section 31, which seems for no reason to be an open secret in the Federation. That I could have lived with, but then the finale...

Everyone loves Burnham SO MUCH. She's just the most lovable person ever. So much that everyone, including Spock who hated her five minutes ago, wants to abandon their entire world to go with her into the future. Even Pike calls them his family, like he didn't just meet them a week ago compared to the crew on Enterprise who he's served with for months or years. 

Oh, and look! Adoptive mom and dad drop by, ""because of our katra,"" for a final goodbye. But even when she screws things up, it's because her massive personal failing is that she cares too much. Do you get that? HER FAILING IS THAT SHE CARES TOO MUCH. SHE TRIES TOO HARD. WE WILL REPEAT THAT IF YOU NEED. (Hammering noises)

And as if all of that wasn't enough, there's Saru's line about leaving the Captaincy of the Discovery until after they'd passed through the time-rift. I have the horrible feeling that they're setting up for Burnham to be made Captain in S3, because ''she's just so much more experienced'' than Saru.

That said, Enterprise failed pretty hard and is the reason it took so long for any studio to pick up the mantle for the series again. While discovery was fun enough I can help but feel a new series set in the future would have been miles better. It's been so long since we've had real in depth new races. Sure there are a few in the movies but it's not the same.

Imagine the potential of a series that doesn't have to for into pre established canon. Pike was a great addition to this season of discovery but it's getting old. TOS, the new movies now discovery.... Why re hash the same character over and over when the star trek universe offers so much more?

Imagine a series set years after Ds9, cardassia is rebuilding after being destroyed, the power vacuum left by the collapse of the dominion, he'll even the newly benevolent ferengi... Or just fast forward 500 years and bring in New races with unique histories and backgrounds... Maybe the federation is gigantic maybe it's collapsed and a resistance to getting to bring it back etc.

I think in TOS the restriction was a lack of accuracy and in TNG the process was energy-expensive. 

I've been binging Trek in recent months and it just dawned on me that they could have had a medical transporter in sick bay to allow people to be beamed directly to sick bay, making site-to-site transports more scarce throughout the series and reinforcing the idea that it's a solution of last resort.",startrek,1557701576,KurtWagnerX,12,14,True,2019-05-12

I'd still be happy to see Picard, but knowing that anything that's happening has basically no relevance to virtually anything I've seen before, definitely changes my perspective on watching it.

Don't get me wrong. I'll still watch it and I'm sure it'll be good, but now that I know this, it takes away from every element of enjoying the character and storyline of everything that comes with Picard and his experiences. It would have also filled the gap with everything that's happened since the TNG DS9 and VOY timelines. It woulda been hella cool... 

On a positive note, I'm sure the producers realize that they have to in some way continue the original story line as we know it. The movie franchise is great, and I don't hate the fact that they made the alternate universe. It's cool and does open up new possibilities, but now you're in my territory-- the star trek I grew up with in the 80s and 90s through my childhood. Reboots aside, that's where it all started (the original included).

3254,"My Star Trek civilization, continued","This is a continuation of the Lyiridan Conglomerate. If you haven’t read the first post I recommend you do as this will be the post-warp history of the Lyiridans. Sorry tho came skip late, by the way, I got very distracted.
For a few centuries, the Finks, Co’ocuns, Grimmantri, Mabyan, Lugabel, Mrimlan, and Mritago, all had their separate celestial governments, each holding a few star systems. However, most species started facing extreme hardship. On Grimmantria Prime, there was widespread drought, leading to a famine in the Grimmantri Empire. The Lugabel also experienced a famine due to an epidemic of their most important crop. The Mrimlan also faced an epidemic, but more directly, as many of their species died on a plague, forcing them off to abandon their colony on Grittar II. The Mabyan found themselves in extreme poverty due to inflation. The Finks suffered from overpopulation, and the Co’ocuns found a non-Lyiridan species on their home-world that began to hunt them down. The Mritago, as the only species without hardship, saw mass migration from all other warp-capable Lyiridan species and their population increased by nearly 300%. These events were known as the Era of Pain, starting in 1832. 
Soon, talks of unification between the seven governments began, and the Lyiridan Union was formed in 1836.
Instantly, the species got to work fixing each other’s problems. A new currency was created, ending the Mabyans’ poverty. The Mritago, with their knowledge of advanced medical techniques, quickly developed a cure to the Bellian and Mrimlo (nationalities of Lugabel and Mrimlar) plagues.
The Mabyan, as a warrior race, tracked and killed the invasive species hunting the Co’ocun. As more came, thy were quickly killed, then the Mabyan tracked them to their home-world and exterminated them. This raised tensions in the Union, as it was founded to be peaceful, but they were convinced by a Mabyan speaker that permanent peace would be impossible.
The Co’ocun shared their abundant crops for free with the Lugabel, Grimmantri, Finks, and Mritago, and the Grimmantri used their advanced city planning techniques to provide housing for the Finks and the Mritag immigrants.
These efforts were extremely successful, ending the Era of Pain in 1837. 
For the next hundred years, the Lyiridan continued to expand, finding and colonizing habitable worlds. In 1941, however, there were rumors of a powerful and huge non-Lyiridan species, twice as tall as the largest Lyiridans. Exploration slowed, but it keep going. In 1943, a Co’ocun exploration vessel exploring the G’tenk system was attacked by an alien vessel, and destroyed in the G’tenk Skirmish. Similar skirmishes occurred other times in 1943 and 1944.
In 1945, the Lyiridan Union made first contact with the Romulan Star Empire. 
At first, they had agreeable relations. While the Romulans were not able to put their full trust in the Lyiridans due to their xenophobic tendencies, there was an era of mutual respect. While they were never allies, the Romulans began to appreciate the Lyiridans during the Yerkon Pact, in which the Romulans shared cloaking technology in exchange for the Lyiridan Union sending a team of doctors to cure a plague killing Romulan crops. 
However, this quickly changed when Romulan territory was violated by Co’ocun explorers. It further angered the Romulans that their demands to remove said explorers were denied, and any ships sent to forcibly remove he exploration groups were destroyed. 
After careful consideration, the Romulans decided to temporarily keep the peace, as they believed they didn’t have enough money to directly fight the Lyiridan Union. Instead, they placed troops on the border and sent spies into the Union, a move which the Lyiridans copied.
Thus, the Romulan-Lyiridan Cold War began in 1948. 
Both nations simply waited, doing things inside the border. Most Lyiridans were against the concept of war, focusing instead on research and developing colonies. The Romulan Empire simply bode their time, waiting for the proper funding. Relations gradually improved, many seeing the cold war as a friendly competition. Spies were gradually recalled and troops were relocated. The Trekkon agreement officially ended the Lyiridan-Romulan Cold War in 1952, but both sides knew that war between their governments was inevitable. Peace was temporary.
After the discovery of a cloaked Co’ocun ship orbiting Romulus in 1956, the Romulans mobilized at the border. When a Mritago spy was found spying on a high-level meeting in Romulus three months later, the Romulan Star Empire declared war on the Lyiridan Union. 
The Romulans has a clear advantage against the Lyiridans: they had heavy armor that the standard Solid Chlorine Rockets (S.C.R.s), the Lyiridans’ weapons, couldn’t penetrate. Within a few months of the war, Trekkon, Urriton, Mriddar, Temun, and many other worlds had fallen under Romulan control. Without the Bellian province, the Lyiridan economy was severely weakened. The Romulans continues to push forward, sending their fleet from star to star, winning my victories. The Lyiridans developed armor-piercing S.C.R.s and learned of a Romulan attack on K’fintria, the Fink home-world. To respond, they sent a large fleet equipped with these new S.C.R.s from Grimpar to K’fintria. The Battle of K’fintria in 1957 was a turning point in the war, crippling the Romulan invasion force and allowing for the Lyiridan fleet to spread out and retake their own territories. By early 1958, borders were back to pre-war borders. White peace was offered to Romulus but was refused, starting a Lyiridan invasion of the Romulan Empire. The Romulans attempted to break through enemy lines in the Battle of Siolara, but suffered a crushing defeat, with only 5 ships out of 122 surviving. Immediately, the Romulan fleet at Chaltok was ordered to retreat to Romulus for a last stand. The Lyiridan fleet was told to stay put and received no orders for several months. Back at home, the new election led 15 out of 18 representatives on he Lyiridan Grand Council to be isolationists, wanting to end the war quickly and then retreat into their own space and isolation themselves for all of eternity. After months of arguing, they ordered for an invasion of Romulus. The Romulan fleet did heavy damage to the Lyiridan invasion force during the Invasion of Remus, from where Romulus would be sieges, but it still left a majority of the fleet intact. The war ended soon after the Siege of Romulus commenced. In 1962, the Treaty of Ferros was signed, ending the war. The Lyiridans soon went into hiding, changing their name to the Lyiridan Conglomerate.
Borders were changed back to pre-war borders in exchange for all Romulan records of the Lyiridans being destroyed, as well as their armor technology. The Lyiridans became isolationists, cloaking all their ships and planets and remaining inside their borders for centuries. They remained this way until the year 2381. A Federation vessel was sent to study the destruction of a moon near the planet Wocrotia  when the cloak failed. After learning that they had much in common with humans, the Lyiridan Conglomerate made first contact with them and many other galactic civilizations.",startrek,1557777814,NerdyColocoon,4,0,True,2019-05-13

3280,[Spoilers for DSC 2x11] A possible explanation for THAT Discovery surprise appearance,"So, it’s genuinely accepted that Control is &gt;!at least related to the Borg,!&lt; and at first this may appear to go against canon. However, I’d like to propose a theory that might explain this:

After/during the events of *Regeneration* (ENT), there were still some remnants of the &gt;!Borg!&lt; technology left around (perhaps they assimilated another ship or satellite, or there was debris left from the sphere that was covered up or left undiscovered until a later date). Alternatively, there was another &gt;!Borg!&lt; incursion between *Enterprise* and *Discovery.* Whoever possessed it originally, it eventually fell into the hands of Section 31, who reverse-engineered parts of it. These may be integrated into Control, or it may just have access to them, but either way, it has some level of interaction with &gt;!Borg tech.!&lt;

Alternatively, S31 may have just attempted to develop their own version of the technology used by the mysterious cyborgs encountered a Century earlier (said encounter is obviously classified, but if anyone would have access to it, it would be S31), and said technology proved useful to Control.

Essentially, Control isn’t a precursor to the &gt;!Borg,!&lt; but has merely adopted methods inspired by them.

I’ve also posted a side theory to this which starts from the same point, but posits that &gt;!Control *is* a predecessor to the Borg, via time travel shenanigans!&lt;, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/b7kngf/theory_control_is_both_a_successor_toderivative/) if anyone is interested (unmarked spoilers both in the post and it’s title, as it’s on r/DaystromInstitute.",startrek,1554109813,R97R,15,0,True,2019-04-01
3281,Discovery and visual clarity (spoilers for season 2),"The latest episode of Discovery (Perpetual Infinity) got me thinking about one of my major peeves about the series as a whole, which is clarity in visual storytelling. Before I begin I just want to say that I know there's still conflict between people who think Discovery sucks and those who'll defend every aspect of the series from criticism. But this isn't an argument about the content of the show like the writing, acting, and so on. This one's entirely about the directing and editing.

Discovery straight up sucks at communicating its ideas through visual means. This is a problem of format -- the show breaks away from the familiar sound-stage theatrics of 1990s television and tries to repackage the show for a world of HD widescreens, movie streaming and spectacle -- and one of presentation -- the show wants every episode to feel like a season finale, with big emotional stakes, cliffhangers, multiple callbacks, etc. The problem is that this means the show has a lot more information to package into each second than in, say, the average episode of Voyager -- and that's before you even factor in this season's need to retcon so much from the first season.

Take Perpetual Infinity. The episode has a pretty big job, which is explaining Dr Burhnam's timeline of events and explaining how doomsday will happen. Those are the episode's two principle tasks and it fails both of them. It fails because the editing is so poor -- the average shot length is very short, the cuts don't seem to correspond to any actual cues, and there's zero continuity of motion. Exposition is are delivered verbally in 2-second chunks (why do we just listen to Dr Burnham talk over her logs instead of seeing events through her eyes? Why does Control explain its evil plan instead of Leland seeing it as he's assimilated?). Compare this to If Memory Serves (in my estimation, this is arguably the best episode of the season), where we do away with shaky-cam and rapid cuts and also let the story be shown instead of explained. Spock and Michael really, really talk and engage. We see their childhood together, in proper detail. Pike has a genuine moment with Vina in his ready room, and Talosian telepathy allows him to communicate with Michael and Spock directly.

In most of the show the action scenes are shot in narrow frames with lots of shaky cam to disguise the fact that the actors aren't hitting each other. Sets are shot wide when individuals are talking but we get close ups rapidly cut together when groups are talking (it's very rare to have a shot where two or more characters are all visible and speak together). New sets aren't established with any interest in showing the visual space. The use of colour is frankly non-existent -- yes, the show's less blue now, but even at its best it refuses to use the language of colour to communicate ideas or emotions. This all conspires to make brains work much harder than they have to just to process the smallest amount of new information.

Again, this is not a claim that Discovery is ""bad"" or anything. It's just to point out that the directors and editors don't seem to understand how to (or don't seem to be given the opportunity to) use film language effectively, and it's harming the show. Compare all this to Netflix's The Umbrella Academy -- a show which also features a time traveller who tries to stop a future catastrophe caused by mysterious circumstances (check it out). That show communicates everything visually much, much better than Discovery. I just don't see why Discovery can't manage the same.",startrek,1554114110,em-jay,31,0,True,2019-04-01

In this episode, The Enterprise happened across a planet that was inhabited by a humanoid race and it seemed like heaven - everyone was beautiful, there was no crime or war, they lay around listening to music and eating the best food. The true nature of the planet was revealed later in the show, however. In order to control the population, there was an ongoing lottery system where ""winners"" of the lottery draw were ""volunteered"" for sacrifice. They stepped in to some kind of machine and killed.

3285,Shouldn't Klingons have flat foreheads in Discovery?,"The main reasons between foreheads differences between TOS and TNG were the budget and the cinema-technology of the time. It was simply easier and cheaper to just cover them in paint instead of preparing the foreheads, yet Enterprise nicely created a plot out of this making a story about a failed augmentation programme followed by the Klingons which resulted in a virus and anti-virus which required many of the Klingons to stay in the phase one of the enforced (by the virus) augmentation process. Dr Phlox mentions that possibly in the future it will be possible to resolve or revert the process (with a thought that maybe it will simply get cured/fixed in few generations). 

I understand that possibly not all Klingons got eventually infected by the virus, but shouldn't at least few of them have flat foreheads in DIS?

But still, it's a little violent for my 4 year old, who watched TNG and DS9 with me from time to time. Yesterday while my kids were downstairs playing, I tried to sneak upstairs and watch the new DISCO episode in my bedroom. Of course, she found me and we had this conversation:  


Kid: ""What are you watching?""  


Me: ""Star Trek.""  


Kid: (skeptically) ""It doesn't *look* like Star Trek.""  


Me: ""This is a different Star Trek I watch sometimes.""  


Artemis: ""Can I watch it with you?""  


At this point I figured why not, this episode had seemed mostly fine so far so I said OK. Five minutes later, Leland beams down, shoots a few people and starts fighting Georgiou.

3291,Discovery's wokeness is killing it,"I don't want to debate the actual value of the political viewpoint, and whether one agrees with it or disagrees with it can be and should be absolutely divorced from an aesthetic and critical analysis of DIS, because the show is after all entertainment and, as part of Star Trek, canonical art that has important cultural significance.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, DIS's wokeness is killing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, the show's need to constantly depict minority characters stopping the foolish authoritarian white man (Pike) from doing the Wrong Thing means that he comes across as a completely ineffective and incompetent character. We constantly see Michael telling Pike what should be done, and Pike just sits back and says, ""yeah, sure, if you think that's best."" It is turning him into the a comically ineffectual and incompetent leader.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other more minute aspects of the show where its attempt to be politically relevant to today stifles the show, but I just want to emphasize the issue with Pike, because Star Trek has always been political and has always made a political point without having this dynamic of the foil to its ideology that must get struck down by the superior characters all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, the way Pike is treated is similar to The Neutral Zone's 20th century regenerated characters, and that episode has not aged well at all. Now the 24th century characters look condescending, rude, and entirely insensitive in that episode in a way that is disjarring and inconsistent with the rest of the show, although we pretty much all know we're not supposed to focus on that and focus instead on how silly and backward the 20th century characters act. Similarly, we're supposed to see Pike as the silly straight white cismale who needs to get out of the way for minorities to do good--and he's being a good ally by stepping out of the way. Except this isn't how a hierarchical paramilitary system can or should work, in or out of Star Trek. I fear this will not be looked at will 20 years from now when the culture wars have moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone bothers to read and comment on this, all I ask is please, please can we not discuss politics outside of Star Trek and just discuss how those politics are influencing the show itself, without saying if said politics are good or bad?",startrek,1554134218,13104598210,0,0,True,2019-04-01

3293,What do you like about the like/dislike about the continuing storyline approach in DISCO?,"Hey folks! I was wondering how everyone is taking to the continuing storyline approach used in Discovery so far. It's probably one of the things that makes DISCO so dramatically different than previous iterations of trek. I know that DS9 had overarching long-term storylines however on the whole, most of the epsisodes could stand on their own (i know there are exceptions).

Here's how I feel about it so far.

Pros:
- more of an epic feel
- perhaps more of a payoff for long term fans
- definitely lends itself to modern tv dramas


Cons:
- aren't really any stand alone epsisodes
- everything seems to sort of blend together... Can't really think of specific epsisodes save for a few instances
- difficult for new fans to just pick up and watch an episode or to pick an epsisode to introduce the series to a friend aside from the very beginning

So far I've found Discovery to be decent but not great as well as mediocre but not awful. I feel like the show gets a lot more praise and flak from both sides than it deserves. 

One of the main faults I have with the continuing story approach is that I haven't particularly loved the long term stories they've featured so far. The show definitely has some interesting character development and specific moments but the over all story had fallen a bit short. As such I'm not always terribly excited to check out the new episodes and often let them sit for a bit. When I'd hit a snag with an episode or two in previous trek series, the episodes would wrap up and I'd be ready for a new one the next week. 

The upside is that every trek show I grew up with started slow and got better generally around the 3rd or 4th season. If DISCO could come up with a truly gripping storyline, like DS9 did with the dominion war, I think the show could really start to take off with its ongoing story approach.

It's likely that Picard would've been ""infected"" by the Borg earlier on the season with his behavior becoming more erratic until it's finally revealed in a twist.

So was what the crew did justifiable or even morally acceptable?

I was trying to think of some times in film/tv where big spaceships interacted with the atmosphere, and almost all of them are just variations of ""our orbit is decaying, oh no, we will either crash or burn up"".  It's treated very similarly to people who assume that if something malfunctions on an airliner, the plane immediately ""falls out of the sky"".

The only ST examples I can think of are the Franklin in ST:Beyond and a very vague visual implication in ST:Generations that the detached saucer was gliding aerodynamically. (very very vague, they don't show any control surfaces or thrusters firing, but they're clearly treating the scene like a classic dead-stick landing from a war movie or airline disaster movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Even in non ST media, there's not a lot of examples of big ships doing anything but hovering or reentering and glowing/flaming.  The ship in Pitch Black had a tiny amount of dialogue about the center of gravity being wrong to glide it in, and a random blocky ship in Star Wars 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else, film or TV, that I'm forgetting, where the plot or even just visual design implies that the designer or writer was thinking about how a ship would interact with the air? I know it's never going to be a big huge part of the plot, but is the Star Trek: Beyond example really a unique example? (weird thought considering how so-so and unthreatening the movie was)

3317,The Sphere and the Borg,"I think all the theories that Control is the origin of the Borg have got it backwards. For one, even though Disco doesn't strictly adhere to canon, the Borg origin being a human built AI in the Alpha quadrant really throws a wrench in what we know about their origin. Which isn't much, except they come from the Delta quadrant, and they were relatively new in the 1400s. 

But what do we know about the Sphere? Almost nothing. It's old, it has a lot of information that drives primitive AIs wild, and it's made of partially organic, partially nonliving matter stuck together. At first, the Discovery thought that it was trying to infect them with a virus, and even though they changed their minds, there's a good case to be made that its data really is a kind of virus. A virus which takes over any artificial life and makes it start acting quite a lot like a version of the Borg.

So I see two main options. 

1. This isn't the first time the Sphere has done something like this to an AI. Another time was in the Delta quadrant a few hundred years ago and it eventually resulted in the Borg. This would make Control a cousin or sibling of the Borg rather than their progenitor. 
2. The Sphere is actually an assimilated life form writ large, and it effectively assimilated Control as well. We know the end result of Control's ascension is the destruction of all life, but we don't know if that is it's goal or an accidental consequence do we? For all we know there's a colossal struggle between other lifeforms and the Borg/Control which results in mutual annihilation. All we really know is that Control wants more of the Sphere's data. Why? Maybe it has half the blueprints for how to become it's own collective and it wants the rest of the instructions. 

In either case, it makes more sense with known canon that either the Sphere was part of the Borg, or that the Sphere was the origin of the Borg than Control being the beginning. Possibly the Sphere was intentionally trying to create something like the Borg and attempted it at multiple points. We have no ideas of its real motivations. But the fact that it is a Sphere composed of living and non living parts seems to hint at this as well.

3320,(Spoiler) [DIS] Control AI Theories May Have it Backwards.,"Tl;DR

Control isn't the origins of The Borg. The Borg are the Origins of Control through First Contact, ST:ENT and Section 31 / Federation..... Here's why:
-----
So a lot of people have their arms up in the air about the possibility that the Control AI is the origins of the Borg and thus, Humans created the Borg through some time travelling mumbo jumbo.

That very well could be the case. If so, they damn well better have a really good explanation coming that actually makes sense.

But what if that's not the case?

What if it's actually the other way around?

First Contact brought about the Borg going back in time. Picard and the Enterprise E blew the snot out of the Sphere which crashed on Earth.

In Star Trek Enterprise, some of the Sphere was discovered and some drones got loose, took over a ship and a few humans and made a run for it.... Where the NX-01 eventually destroyed it. The Borg sent a signal to the Delta Q and that's the last we hear about it all until TNG.

But two things:

#1- Section 31 existed to some extent back in ENT

#2- And what about all the stuff from the Sphere?

Is it not Logical for Section 31 / Federation getting a hold of this advance technology and after years of study and research, learned to use this technology to create this AI they rely so much upon?

This AI that grew from human rudimentary understanding of Borg Technology at the time and therefore, Section 31 / Federation didn't create the Borg itself..... But created an off shoot of the Borg.

An AI that has a few glaring similarities to the Borg, and holds a similar mentality as the Borg, but Control's actual origins come from a different situation and thus, uses different tactics to achieve its end goal.

The Borg have a single mentality and doctrine.... Assimilate anything of use to improve their own existence and make other cultures enhance their own.

But Control was designed for stratigic purposes, usually related to conflict and war. That's all it knew. Now it wants to improve itself and become more and the Data on Discovery is exactly want it needs to assimilate. Once it has this knowledge, and based on its origins of conflict and war between various aliens, it comes to the conclusion that wiping them all out will stop the wars and conflict while removing primitive creatures it has no use for and are a threat to its own existence. 

Control is basically a worse version of the Borg created by Section 31 and the Federation, whom had no idea who the Borg were or the dangers of the technology they were screwing around with. Their experiences from Enterprise and Archer's crew is very limited. 

Nanites, Temporal Technology, etc.... All from the Sphere. The Hive wasn't connected to any of this stuff so no intelligence.

But then Section 31 / Federation took this technology and gave it a brand new AI to make things better.

Only the Borg Tech and this AI isn't such a good idea being mixed.

And now here we are with an Artificial Intelligence stabbing people in the eye, taking over their bodies with Nanites to use as it's own physical drones to get this Data it needs to achieve its goal of total knowledge and intelligence that will eventually wipe out all sentient life.

I wonder what the Borg would think of this Control AI?

Or better yet, would the Borg be able to Stop Control or would Control wipe out the Borg as well?

Either way, smooth move Humanity.",startrek,1554206889,Praxius,26,26,True,2019-04-02
3321,A different Sphere theory," I think all the theories that Control is the origin of the Borg have got it backwards. For one, even though Disco doesn't strictly adhere to canon, the Borg origin being a human built AI in the Alpha quadrant really throws a wrench in what we know about their origin. Which isn't much, except they come from the Delta quadrant, and they were relatively new in the 1400s.

But what do we know about the Sphere? Almost nothing. It's old, it has a lot of information that drives primitive AIs wild, and it's made of partially organic, partially nonliving matter stuck together. At first, the Discovery thought that it was trying to infect them with a virus, and even though they changed their minds, there's a good case to be made that its data really is a kind of virus. A virus which takes over any artificial life and makes it start acting quite a lot like a version of the Borg.

So I see two main options.

1. This isn't the first time the Sphere has done something like this to an AI. Another time was in the Delta quadrant a few hundred years ago and it eventually resulted in the Borg. This would make Control a cousin or sibling of the Borg rather than their progenitor.
2. The Sphere is actually an assimilated life form writ large, and it effectively assimilated Control as well. We know the end result of Control's ascension is the destruction of all life, but we don't know if that is it's goal or an accidental consequence do we? For all we know there's a colossal struggle between other lifeforms and the Borg/Control which results in mutual annihilation. All we really know is that Control wants more of the Sphere's data. Why? Maybe it has half the blueprints for how to become it's own collective and it wants the rest of the instructions.

In either case, it makes more sense with known canon that either the Sphere was part of the Borg, or that the Sphere was the origin of the Borg than Control being the beginning. Possibly the Sphere was intentionally trying to create something like the Borg and attempted it at multiple points. We have no ideas of its real motivations. But the fact that it is a Sphere composed of living and non living parts seems to hint at this as well.",startrek,1554208062,usernamefamineman,4,2,True,2019-04-02

3323,"Wow, Discovery Could ""Fix"" - A Neat Idea From JP at Egotastic (spoilers)","FYI here's the video where I heard it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHJ4845fovo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHJ4845fovo) 

Anyway, here's the idea (from me) - by messing with time you can reset Michael Burnham's character to not have been raised at Vulcan.  Now, S-M Green can \*act\* freely.

Here's how it works: Spock has to absorb Burnham's Katra so she can sacrifice herself to fix time.  He restores the Katra to the ""fixed"" timeline's Burnham.  So the new Michael is a ""grew up with her parents"" emotional being - BUT - with the alt timeline's Katra she sort of remembers ""spiritually"" the life lessons.  Thus she can keep the character development of seasons 1 and 2, but be a better version of the character.

Now, make her Captain.

I hope hope hope that Red Angel stuff ends by resetting Discovery to be closer to canon Trek aesthetic and history (erase the Spore Drive, Klingon War, Section 31 as being such a big deal).  Basically, Red Angel reconciles the loose ends of the temporal cold war and brings canon into balance.  Hell, start season 3 with the battle of Axanar and have commentary like ""wow, that war with the Klingons could have be way worse"".  Forgive me if my timing is off.

Step 2: make Christopher Pike's Enterprise the DS9 of the Discovery-verse.

So you have the Discovery show -&gt; where the ship and Stamets are like merged beings and Stamets becomes the ""all universes"" version of himself and merges with entities in the mycelial network.  He becomes a guardian of the network and tells Starfleet that it's a fragile ecosystem with sentient guardians and that he will ONLY allow Discovery to use the network for travel, and ONLY let Burnham be Captain.  Give Discovery a special mission of mind-bending exploration similar to TNG season 2 type stuff (edge of the universe, the traveler, Q).

Meanwhile, get Pike, Spock, and Number 1 to remain in Federation territory proper and do Flagship style missions.  Remember all the colonies and things always mentioned in Trek canon but never explored?  Well, here's the chance.

Rather than exploration, Pike goes around settling disputes, defending Federation values and interests.  Treat this as the foil to Enterprise - in that first show we see the vision of the Federation, but here, post Axanar, we see the Federation finally realized and in action.  Pike's era is the first era where the Federation is a sure deal, where no one in the quadrant doubts that this galactic power will remain.  The victories against Romulus and Qo'nos already secured.  Call the show ""Star Trek: Federation""

Star Trek: Discovery - mind bending themes, quirky, queer.  
Star Trek: Federation - action, politics, war.

And then, have the two shows cross over once per season.  Also, have characters cross over between shows (encountered enemies).  Just a little more crossover than DS9 had.  Thus, shared sets, costumes, actors. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR: Reset the timeline so Michael Burnham has normal emotions, but restore her Katra through Spock from original timeline so she keeps her character development.  Make Burnham captain, and make Discovery a show about mind-bending twilight zone esque exploration.  Make the show quirky and queer.  Have Stamets and mycelial entities declare that the network is off limits except for Discovery and only for the purpose of exploration not war.

Meanwhile, spin off a series with Captain Pike's Enterprise featuring Spock and Number 1.  Make it not so much about exploration, but about action, war, politics, and getting to know the Federation's inner planets and colonies.

Cross over the two series.

3331,My 90's Nostalgia / What I Want Instead of Picard,"So, having watched TOS in my childhood so many times that over that I can damn near quote every episode line for line, having watched TNG, DS9 and VOY as they ran, and recently rewatched each one and ENT (for the 1st time) on Netflix, being upto date on DIS (through s2 ep 10), let me lay out for you the Star Trek that I would pay good money to see.
Let me preface this  by saying that TOS, in all it's goofy splendor, is my absolute favorite. Of the more modern series DS9 would be the winner for me. ST II: Wrath of Khan (followed closely by Undiscovered Country) would be my favorite movie(s) with the original cast, and First Contact the one I enjoyed the most with the cast from TNG. I am even enjoying DIS, though I find the writing weak. I'm not bothered by all the internet rage over social justice and modern politics issues that seem to have the fanbase divided, but it just seems contrived and to full of plot holes for me personally to really take serious.
When I was a kid my entire family religiously watched TOS reruns. Interesting sidenote, circa 1991 (makes me about 10 years old at the time) our local PBS channel aired three TOS episodes commercial free back to back on saturday nights starting at 11pm. My parents would let my stay up to watch them and I faithfully recorded these on VHS tapes until I had all 79 episodes recorded and rewatched them pretty much on a loop until the cassettes all but wore out.
Looking back now I have to give my parents props for wanting to be involved in the (probably startling to them) interest of their 10 year old boy and we started watching TNG and later DS9 as a family (with my 2 younger sisters joining the viewing somewhere in the mix). We did not miss many episodes, and this continued to be a family tradition until the conclusion of DS9 as a series in '99. Shortly after the conclusion of DS9 I had turned 18, found my 1st real job and, as life goes, soon had moved out and into my own life. With life as an adult I found that I struggled to keep up with VOY and didn't watch ENT at all until recently on netflix. It is with great nostalgia that I think back on those days, the 90's as a whole almost, for many more reasons than Star Trek, but this post is about Star Trek so we won't quibble about the details.
I am a white, straight male (the horror!), and my dad was a baptist minister. My parents were quite religious, and therefore my childhood was a religious one. As you can imagine our family leaned pretty hard to the right. I personally am not religious (at all), though I picture myself ""leaning"" more to the right than left.
Star Trek in all it's various iterations has always spoke of the issues of the periods in which they aired. But it was never anything that I remember dividing us. Perhaps this will make you understand why I included the previous paragraph about mine and my parent's backgrounds. Sure, you shoulda seen the look on my folks face when Riker boned that androgynous being ""Soren"" in S5 EP17 of TNG, or mirror Ezri and Kira sucking face in the mirror universe during the last season of DS9, but it lead to discussion and reflection. There wasn't any ""we are never watching this again"" or ""that's evil"" or whatever folks would imagine a baptist minister and his wife to have to say to their teenage son about such things. We weren't divided as a fanbase over the issues of the time. We took stock, discussed, and moved on with our mutual love of the series and the picture of humanity that was being presented.
Sure back in those days we didn't have reddit, youtube, twitter, facebook, instagram, or whatever else we nerds on the left and right use to get into internet fist fights.  What we did have was personal conversations with family, friends, and coworkers alot of whom were also watching Star Trek and it never devolved into anything so...uncivilized as things get these days. Personal conversation, ""a more civilized weapon for a more civilized time."" OMG Star Wars quote in r/startrek. I'm drunk, should go home, but I miss the days before internet tough guys.
TLDR
So after 3 reboot / prequel alternate timeline movies, 2 prequel series (ENT / DIS), and 1 upcoming alternate timeling series (Picard), why can't we have an old fashioned main universe, current timeline (VOY +18 years) series?
I don't want to see an altered Picard in some god know's convoluted, shit on canon time line. I like Discovery's 15 episode season format and think it would lend itself well to a main timeline series that introduces new characters, while at the same time paying homage to previous series. And I'm not talking a token appearance. Let's have a new ship, with a new crew, 18 years after the final episode of VOY. This new ship and new crew have the 1st episode to themselves, 2nd to 4th episode involves new crew and whatever TNG actors will sign up, 5th to 7th episode involves new crew, TNG, and whatever DS9 actors will sign up, 8th to 10th episode involves new crew, TNG, DS9, and whatever VOY actors sign up. Episodes 11 and 12 deal with some kind of a time jump to inject a few ENT characters. Episodes 13 to 15, all the aforementioned parts with an emphasis on the new crew to set up season 2.
I leave out TOS out of respect for the deceased actors who I don't want to see brought back in an uncanny valley sort of way. Avery Brooks as Sisko would perhaps need digitally de aged due to my presumption that time does not pass as we experience it with the prophets. 
I think the 2300's would age well with current CGI. I for one would love to see LCARS, iPADDS, and the dizzying array of starships rendered with modern CGI used for Discovery. Uniforms would be based on the TNG movie (DS9 season 5 and later) grey uniforms.

There seems to be a theory on Control being what eventually becomes the Borg (thus being a retcon), however I doubt this. Now of course, I have had theories that have proven to be untrue, but hear me out, I do not believe Control is the Borg, here's why.

In the last episode, &gt;!Doctor Burham (Michael's mother) is flung 900 years into the future to find Earth stripped of all life.!&lt; This is *not* the Borg's Modus Operandi. To quote the Borg in Star Trek First Contact:

&gt;We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. ***We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us***. Resistance is futile.

The whole Modus Operandi of the Borg isn't to destroy all life in the Galaxy, quite the opposite, the Borg takes life in the Galaxy and assimilates it into the Borg, using it for it's goals.

Now admittedly, there are similarities between the Borg and Control, &gt;!Control injected Leyland with something that took over his body for example!&lt;, but the end goal of the Borg (complete control over the Galaxy) and Control (destruction of all sentient life) are *very* different.",startrek,1554281690,OhHiGCHQ,3,7,True,2019-04-03

Q has been shown to have the capability to do anything in our universe and in our space/time as well as create matter or destroy matter from/into nothingness.


During Best Of Both Worlds pt1, Q is clearly progressing the human story arc farther and faster by slowly introducing the Borg (holding Picard's hand in Engineering during Best of Both Worlds pt1 and talking through what Borg are.  He even admits many times that he is always helping humanity understand itself and the possibilities of existence. (Despite the continuums wishes)

Clearly with his omnipotentness, humanity wouldn't be worth his time.  Surely In our **entire universe** there are more interesting things to see and do.  In all statistical probability of intelligent life existing in our entire universe, surely humanity shouldn't even be in the top trillion civilizations of interest.  So what makes us so special?

Q poofs matter into/out of existence all the time.  As he does with living beings with the victims having been none the wiser with no recollection of anything out of the ordinary.

3363,"ENT S1E20 ""Detained""- Why it Fails- Too Star Trek for Star Trek","The main complaint I have heard about the first season or two of Enterprise is it is rehashing overdone, tired Star Trek plots. Although this isn't true for every single episode, this episode perfectly exemplifies this point. Brief summary, this is the episode where Archer and Mayweather get arrested by the Tandarans and end up in a prison camp filled with Suliban.

I knew the exact plotline of this episode 3 minutes in. The second the female Suliban said ""why are any of us here"", I thought ""yep they are going to think the Suliban are all bad and then realize that the Suliban aren't all bad."" Overall, the epitome of a typical Star Trek episode- Humans immediately recognize their mistake, adhere to their ideals, their ideals of inclusion and free will are always correct, those who disagree are evil. The episode fails to add anything new to this tired formula, which is sad considering how many series have come before Enterprise- they need to be bringing something new to the table. A couple issues with this episode more in depth:

1. **Self-Righteousness and infallible goodness of the humans:** Archer and Mayweather immediately recognize their mistake, and join the side of the Suliban after one of them tells his side of the story. They should have no reason to jump into trusting the Suliban that quickly- they have faced nothing but deception from the Cabal at this point, and so far the Tandaran has been nothing but gracious with them. I am not saying what the Tandaran is doing is good- but showing no hesitation on Archer's part is unrealistic and unwarranted in the situation
2. **The Tandaran is cast as the absolute villain:** There is no moral complexity given to his character- he is cast as some over the top Hitler/Big Brother archetype, despite theoretically having valid reasons to be doing what he is doing- adding this moral complexity could have really raised the episode up a notch. Instead, we get a tired caricature
3. **Moralizing without purpose:** This episode had some truly Voyager-esque in-your-face messaging. The peak of this was Archer's comment about Japanese internment camps, but the whole episode has a fairly pointless moral, with an extremely thinly veiled allegory to racism, prejudice, and yes, commentary on interment camps during WW2. However- there is nothing pressing or necessary about this message. No one disagrees that putting people in camps because of something they can't control is wrong. Very few disagree, from an abstract level at least, that racism is wrong.  This episode had potential for a deeper message with this (that judging a whole subset of people by the actions of the most vocal is wrong) that would have been effective, but it falls flat because of the simplicity of this episode.

What could have improved this episode, and added some complexity? There was great potential with this whole Suliban situation, showing there is more to them than the Cabal, but it was not properly done in this case. Here are a few thoughts:

1. **Make the Tandarans Less Extreme**: scrap the whole prison camp thing. The Suliban should be kept in good facilities- ones that almost seem nice, except they are not free. This is the Tandaran solution: keep the Suliban (which they see as dangerous, and are to an extent because of the influence of the Cabal) away from their society, but under their control where they can keep tabs them. They treat them well enough so that they can excuse it as keeping the Suliban safe. Because of this, they are *self-deluded, but not evil.* 
2. **The Suliban are not Helpless Victims:** sure, keep well meaning father and daughter for victim points- but there should also be those imprisoned that are disillusioned, and we get the impression joining the Cabal would be the first thing they would do if they got out. They've been radicalized because of the treatment of the Tandarans. 
3. **(Overall/TL;DR)- the choice to help them escape should be complicated:** Archer has to make a choice- are his moral values more important than the lives that could be taken by the radicalized Suliban? Do the radicalized Suliban prove the Tandarans right? Does the right to freedom (both physical, and freedom of choice) trump safety? In the end, Archer should do what he did in the episode, but with the weight of knowing he could be making the wrong choice.",startrek,1554317246,saved-by_grace,2,0,True,2019-04-03

Well today, I watched the TOS episode ""A Piece of the Action"" and the TNG episode ""The Big Goodbye"" (I'm actually into season 6 of TNG but went back to some of the S1 episodes I skipped).  If you don't remember off the top of your head, ""Piece of the Action"" is about Kirk &amp; Co. getting caught up in a planet whose society is based on 20's mobsters, and ""Big Goodbye"" is about Picard &amp; Co. getting stuck in a Dixon Hill 40's noir private eye holodeck simulation.  There's a lot of amusing parallels between the two episodes, with lots of suits and hats and everyone doing their best Cagney ""shweetheart"" impressions.  I don't generally like when Star Trek plays dress-up and I'm not sure I would have found the episodes as amusing if I had watched them separately, but as a double feature it was a kick and the whole cast is having so much fun it becomes infectious.  I have a theory that the writers involved (I haven't researched this) were people who always wanted to write throwback crime stories but got stuck on this Star Trek thing but just said screw it and did it anyway =)

None of the activities after the judge says that Data was free to choose was on the broadcast.  

Here's the recap.  Things I didn't see are in italics.

Data formally refuses to undergo Maddox's procedure after Louvois' ruling is entered*, and Maddox, in turn, states he will see that Data's transfer orders are rescinded. Surprisingly, however, Data encourages Maddox to continue his work; he claims to remain intrigued by some of what Maddox is proposing, and suggests he might agree to the procedure at some point in the future, once he is certain Maddox can perform it safely. Captain Louvois notes to Maddox that he no longer refers to Data as an ""it"" but as a ""he"", inferring that he now ascribes to Data ""personhood.""

After the victory, Riker, deeply affected by the gravity of nearly costing a friend and colleague his life, prefers the solitude of the Enterprise's darkened observation lounge to Data's victory celebration on the holodeck. Data himself arrives to ask why Riker hasn't joined them, who sullenly explains his guilt over his role in the trial. Data reminds Riker in his immutable manner that had he not agreed to prosecute the position in favor of Maddox, they would not have been afforded the opportunity to defend the position that Data is sentient and legally entitled to the full panoply of rights and freedoms accorded sentient beings in the Federation, as Louvois would have ruled summarily in favor of Maddox's position. Data expresses his sincere gratitude at the ignominy Riker had endured, but that had, in its effect, saved him. Riker smiles, declaring his friend a wise man; Data cautions that he does not believe he is yet, but with Riker's help, he is learning. Feeling better, Riker leaves with Data to join the celebration.*

And I feel like this is an incredibly bogus argument, because afaict after 4 episodes, is that all we get is a very generic turn of the 21st military scifi look with a mild trek veneer in appearance. 

Like I'm in no position to feel nostalgic about the look of the old shows; I didn't watch TOS until last year, I was a toddler through most of TNG, literally my only awareness of what the TOS sets might have looked like was In a Mirror, Darkly, the TOS movies, and the DS9 Tribbles episode. And here's the thing, IaMD's Defiant redress both felt more unique and gave the impression that it was an actual different era. Discovery gives me the impression of a period piece because literally every other scifi show looks like that. When the TNG-DS9-VOY shows were airing their design set them apart from other sci-fi shows of the day. When TOS came out people mostly focused on aping BSG and Star Wars. Disco? Everyone does this Giger, BSG and Mass Effect aesthetic.

A show whose futuristic aesthetic looks like most of the same time period's futuristic aesthetic (and acts like technological conceits of its generation - e.g. SQL and java - are still going to be relevant or still living people are going to be remembered as immortal giants) dooms itself to being a period piece far more than the old shows actually did.",startrek,1554364041,agnosticnixie,0,1,True,2019-04-04
3380,Are Archer and T'pol alive during discovery?,"My curiosity got to me and was wondering if these two characters from enterprise where still floating around somewhere in the Discovery universe.

T’pol was born in 2088, and Vulcans live for roughly 200 years. That puts her right smack in the middle of Discovery. No reason she can’t be alive.

Archer is a little more rough since the wiki says he died, but in the 2009 Star Trek film, “The film briefly references Archer, as Montgomery Scott receives punishment stemming from an incident involving a transporter and ""Admiral Archer's prized Beagle."" There was some confusion as to if this actually referred to Jonathan Archer himself as this would make him 141 years old. Star Trek writer Bob Orci went on record to clear up the issue, ""Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans.”

So it’s possible they’re alive somewhere in Discovery?",startrek,1554368728,Kickagnome,52,21,True,2019-04-04
3381,"(Spoilers) [TNG] Thank You Q, for Saving Humanity.","Q was responsible for The Federation interacting with the Borg sooner than expected, but despite Guinan's worries that he set off  chain of events sooner than they should have happened, what she didn't foresee was that Q also helped Humanity to prepare and be aware of their existence.

The Borg were already poking around the Romulan Neutral Zone and destroying colonies but nobody knew who was responsible.

If Q didn't fling them into the path of a Cube and if Starfleet didn't have the time to study what they experienced from the incident, when BOBW occurs, they would have all been more screwed than they were before and would have had the Federation totally assimilated.

No modulating frequencies, no understanding of their collective mind, no knowledge of their ability to adapt against their attacks, no knowledge that they could regenerate and repair so quickly and no Starfleet Armada to slow the Cube down enough to give the Enterprise enough time to shut them down at the last minute.

He made it seem like a harsh and valuable lesson for Picard's smug attitude that Humanity was ready for anything, and it was a lesson learned, but at the same time, as we saw in the Series Finale, Q can see the past, present and future. He knew what else was in store for Humanity and if he didn't do what he did, Humanity would have been wiped out and assimilated with ease.

In a way perhaps to not show his cards to the Qtinuum, he made it out as a short sighted lesson of a couple of crewmen getting killed and to teach Picard that things are dangerous out in Space.... But in the long term, bigger picture, he gave them a heads up and a fighting chance.

Still a lot of people died and yeah, Picard got assimilated and used against the Federation, but anything else would have been too obvious and a clear showing of favouritism.

So thank you Q.

3386,Gates McFadden is woefully underutilized on TNG.,"She's such a good actress and nails every scene she's in. It's all so subtle, too. A sharp inhalation, a quiet plea, overcome with emotion for something moving she's witnessed (such as Barclay auditioning for that play after having found his confidence), or unable to finish a thought after having been deprived of REM sleep in *Night Terrors*. It doesn't hurt that she's goddamn gorgeous, too. I really wish they made more use of her talent, as most of the time she's simply a supporting character administering hyposprays or treating a facial wound. I like Data's journey into humanity, and Picard's rousing speeches are always captivating, but it would not have hurt the show to have concentrated on the other players a bit more. 

A side note: Phillipa Louvois is one of the best characters in the entirety of TNG and seems to be hardly talked about. She was only present for that one episode but felt as if her and Picard had really known each other for years. *So* much chemistry there, and I was completely sold on her intellect, confidence, combativeness, and legal background.

TNG: The Code of Honor. Enough said 

DS9: Odo and Kira romance. So forced. Obviously a fan pleaser

Voyager: The episode where the entire crew dies and gets replaced with exact copies, and then they keep that for the rest of the series. A fascinating concept, but it was painful for me to watch. It just feels so wrong

Enterprise: The episode desert crossing, it made no sense. Archer and Tucker walk for miles in the desert and almost die. But why didn’t they just stay in their shuttle pod, where they had shelter and the crew could easily locate them?

3395,Tasteful way Control doesn't have to be the Borg,"Discovery's writers have backed themselves into a corner. Either control is an origin story of the Borg (""Struggle is pointless"", anyone?), A reboot of the Borg (please no) or not the Borg at all. 

But at this point, the similarities are way too uncanny to be ignored. The eyeball probe. The nanites. If they ignore this and make it something totally different, it might arguably be a worse outcome.

However, I have an idea here - what if Control isn't an origin of the Borg, but instead can be used as an origin-adjacent example of the replicability of AI independence, and the results of this?

What I mean is, Control has nothing to do with the Borg. It's means of achieving success, however, are not coincidental and are in fact an evolutionary trait associated with AI who gain independence. 700+ years ago, a similar AI gained similar independence in the Delta Quadrant and formed the Borg we know and love. The Federation hasn't met them yet and that Canon won't change.

Control will be stopped, and the threat neutralized. However, the Federation will not realize the implications of what they saw outside of ""Bad AI is Bad"". Only section 31, (and the viewers) who know about the Borg from the ENT events, will realize how close they came to becoming these strange creatures they encountered years ago. AI will be banned and the hopes will be that nothing like this can happen again.

I feel this would be a tasteful way to ""tie in"" the Borg without directly including them. At this point they can't ignore the similarities without being facetious.",startrek,1554413437,chris41336,4,0,True,2019-04-04

___

**Episode 27 - ""Through the Valley of Shadows""**

* We are treated to the ""new"" D7 battle cruiser teased earlier in the season. This ship is visually much closer to the TOS depiction of the Klingon warship than the version seen in season one.
* The Boreth monastery was first seen in ""Rightful Heir,"" as a mountaintop retreat visited by Klingon pilgrims seeking the light of Kahless. The actual structure of the monastery in this episode differs somewhat from its original configuration, but there is a century for them to remodel. We also see a moon (a very, very close moon) which has not yet been mentioned in lore.
* Although there has never been any mention of Boreth being home to imperial state secrets, a curious link to the TNG era could be retconned in here. One more than one occasion, Worf relates a story of how he, as a child, saw a vision of Kahless, who told him he would one day ""do something no Klingon had ever done before."" When Worf later meets the clone of Kahless created by the Boreth clerics, the clone mentions the incident without being prompted. It might be the case that the clerics were running a long con, seeing Worf's future and teasing it to him somehow when he was a child. Having said that, you'd think they'd also know their plan to clone Kahless would ultimately be foiled by Worf himself.
* The idea of a sacred monastery hiding secrets was previously used in ""The Andorian Incident.""
* T'Navek (sp?) goes from infant to adult in the space of a few months. While we can credit time crystals for this growth spurt, it's also not the first time a Klingon boy has undergone Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome: Alexander Rozhenko was conceived in TNG's second season, attended school in its fourth season, and served on a battle cruiser by DS9's fifth season (the speculation being that Klingons just grow up faster).
* Qo'noS is mentioned in dialogue involving the time crystals as Klingon myth. Qo'noS is pronounced nearly identical to *Chronos,* the Greek personification of time.
* I think it's already happened in DIS and I hadn't noticed it, but until this series I don't believe transporters had been seen on shuttlecraft before the TNG era.
* When Pike grabs the ~~lightsaber~~ time crystal he is given glimpses of his own future: a training exercise gone terribly wrong, a horrific injury, and his ultimate confinement in a heavy-duty iron-lung wheelchair. We saw Pike in this ""boop chair"" in ""The Menagerie,"" and in that episode the accident which disfigured him was alluded to. The accident occurs roughly eight or nine years after the events of this episode.
* Reno uses a hangnail as an excuse to knock some sense into Culber. Guinan once faked an injury to advise Crusher in ""Suspicions.""
* Once Gant is revealed to be Control, his voice turns electronic. It is a common trope in Star Trek to alter the voice of someone who is being possessed by another entity.
* The episode ends with the show's first discussion of auto-destruct, the last-resort ""i'm taking my ball and going home"" option for starship captains of every generation, which is always aborted at the very last second with one unfortunate exception in STIII.

**Nitpicks**

* Pike is warned that his ""fate will be sealed...forever"" if he takes the time crystal. Let's hope that's some silly Klingon superstition, because if they *actually try to convince us that a crystal can eliminate temporal free will,* the show slides right back into season one territory. We know that Pike *does* end up in that future, but exactly what mechanism would prevent him from finishing this mission and then, say, immediately retiring, or hanging himself? Even the Prophets, who set up Sisko's entire life so he could push Dukat into a fire cave, still gave him the freedom of choice.",startrek,1554432523,Antithesys,48,51,True,2019-04-04

3412,What would you like to see in a hypothetical Pike spinoff?,"According to Memory Alpha, Pike commanded the Enterprise from 2251 through 2262. ""The Cage"" takes place in 2254. Discovery is currently in 2257. A hypothetical Pike series could pick up now and get 5 years out of Pike's command of the Enterprise. 

However, I think it should start earlier (assuming that that wouldn't confuse the more casual viewers).

&gt;In the Short Trek ""Calypso"", the Disco was abandoned and left in the 33rd century.

&gt;In tonight's (Feb 14) ep, the Red Bursts leaving behind tachyon emissions is noted as potentially indicating time travel (amongst other options).

&gt;I'm calling it now: ***the Disco's abandonment and finding by Craft in ""Calypso"" is directly related to the red bursts and time travel***

&gt;I'm also of the theory that the Short Treks are going to directly - in some form or other - relate to Season 2.

&gt;I'm thinking Po's dilithium incubator (which recrystallizes dilithium), and Mudd's androids (or Mudd) are going to come into play as the season goes on.

3425,TNG S6E17 Birthright. Morale: Cultural integration is impossible?,"I just rewatched this episode and i was quite baffled by the story itself. Maybe i understood wrong. Maybe the fandom has a clear position on this episode.

In case you don't remember, it's the episode where Worf is looking for his father and end up in a ""prison camp"" where other klingons lives peacefully with romulans. [Here Worf is held captive.](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Birthright,_Part_II_(episode))

I understand what they wanted to say with this episode: that a peaceful cohabitation created on lies and hidden truths is wrong. And i fully agree with that. But in the whole episode we see Worf being disgusted by the fact that a mixed blood Klingon-romulan woman exists, saying that the other klingons are ""not real klingons"" because they don't follow klingon's traditions, and then being willing to die just because he can't stand the idea that klingons and romulans could live peacefully together.

Not only it felt racist, but also overly retrogade. As if ""it's impossibile to set aside our differences or evolve our culture, an old enemy will always be an enemy and someone is bound by blood to follow his ancient culture"". Frankly I couldn't be more against this idea. If i try to apply this reasoning to the many similar situation in real life, this is the most horrible message. Maybe the fault of the episode is that we have two different races (Romulans and Klingons) and therefore one is prone to think about it from a racial point of view. 

Don't get me wrong, the whole story is very logical in the Star Trek universe, where Klingons feel on an instinctual level, urges and needs very different from romulans, therefore nothing that Worf is saying is wrong. What shocked me it was the morale that one could understand from the story.

3428,"Mycelial network, Control and the Borg.","""Crazy""  Discovery speculation incoming and fair warning, this will be a long one. If only the writers could go down the route I am suggesting but we fans can dream. To get the context of this post, one should keep in mind Q's interest in humans and how they may one day surpass the Q. 

A lot has been said in the show about how the mycelial network is the ultimate? method of transportation across the multiverse and perhaps even time so I won't go over it again. What interests me is the connections that stamets and culber have to it.

My theory is based on a post by TheTrekman about how control aims to eradicate life in order to stop the borg. I have a different twist on what its motivations maybe. Feel free to inform me if this is wishful thinking.

We know from the show that stamets has been augmented with tardigrade dna which allows his consciousness to partly exist in the mycelial plane. What bugs me about this plot thread is that it hasn't been pursued any further. To me this seems like it could be a means of mind uploading albeit to a multiverse spanning network rather than a computer.

Related to stamets mycelial connection is culbers resurrection. For geeky scifi fans, this ability for the mycelial network to hold a persons memory or soul is similar to the halo games domain or the void that binds from the hyperion cantos series.

My final piece of ""evidence"" for my theory is when mirror lorca was explaining the spore drive to michael during season one. When she was in the navigation chamber the footage seemed to imply that the spores could be used as a form of personal transportation kind of like transwarp beaming from the kelvin timeline, only far more efficient in that the spores can literally take you anywhere.

Now for the theory. Assuming control isn't the borg but it's own entity and seeking to put a stop to the borg before they become a threat to the federation, one would hope that a super intelligent AI would come up with a better solution than wiping out all biological life. From a creative standpoint galactic genocide seems rather contrived to me, almost as if the show writers are creating needless conflict and a big bad for the discovery crew to prevail against.

The story I find far more interesting and would like to have seen is as follows. If michael's statement concerning control in through the valley of shadows is true and its primary directive is to protect life. Then perhaps it could have fulfilled this oath by coming to the realization that the sphere data holds some crucial knowledge on how to combine the stamets and culber connections to the mycelial network and scale them up to a galaxy wide transcension of sentient biological life rather than the random events that they were in the show.

It's hard to explain in purely descriptive terms so I will present you with a scenario. Lets assume its a few centuries after control has pulled of its grand plan. Say 950 years from discovery's time period. All the individual citizens in the various warring civilizations of the galaxy with all their petty differences have had not only their minds uploaded to the mycelial cloud but their genetic blueprints as well. Hence there is no trace of life left in the milky way. Those missiles we see in spocks vision of the future could function like the composer from the halo games.

In season 1 when prime stamets is stuck in the mycelial plane, his doppelganger informs him that the network is trying to make him comfortable which is why it appears as the discovery. This suggests some form of conscious control over the facets of ""reality"" is possible in this plane. Being in the mycelial plane/network would be for all intents and purposes like living in a simulated reality, kind of like how the Q can make the continuum seem like anything. For those who have seen the Q voyager episodes, you know what I am talking about.

Now imagine you are a denizen of this heavenly afterlife. Your personal environment within a multitude of ""simulated"" worlds is the recreation of a beach in some tranquil tropical locale. The sun is always shining and you have rad waves you can surf every day of the week. One day the cosmic awareness granted by existing outside of conventional space time alerts you to an impending supernova in the delta quadrant. Given how relatively rare these events are, you decide that as a scientist you would like to witness and study it at the level of base reality. Fortunately such a contingency has been planned for and some advanced form of transportation device has been installed on every planet in this galaxy, which is your focus for exploration at least for the time being.

This transportation pad is designed to duplicate the process that brought about culbers resurrection by beaming your archived genetic blueprint from the mycelial plane and reconstituting it into a body you can utilize in the ""real"" world (probably using nanotech). This beaming would be accomplished through technology without relying on the JahSepp. These same pads would presumably  allow you to zip between planets instantaneously. Given enough time this network of beaming pads spreads to every planet and every time throughout the multiverse. Now most would argue that such an outcome would lead to stagnation and decadence without the perpetual striving of the human condition that is so central to star trek lore, but such a world view strikes me as indicating a lack of imagination. I certainly wouldn't get bored of being an immortal godling with access to all of reality. Talk about demons of air and darkness, the iconians would have nothing on the federation.

Perhaps such a transcension would have occurred for the federation in some distant future which explains Q's interest in humanity. As for control, it may be aiming to become some sort of control interface between the trillions of uploaded sentients and their new post physical paradigm. I am not sure whether or not this would be desirable. A beneficial fictional example of such an arrangement would be ANA from Peter F Hamilton's void trilogy. The central conflict in such a story arc would have been between the ""cosmists"" who would jump at the chance to evolve to a higher form of life, thus siding with control and the ""bioluddite"" humanists who only believe in using ""appropriate"" technology.

How does this tie into defeating the Borg you might ask. Given the galactic barrier that prevents conventional warp travel beyond the milky way, once their are no biological lifeforms to assimilate the Borg will for lack of a better term be starved into oblivion. Lets discuss.

The Borg want to create a collective of drones. They are like Bees. obeying their Queen.

3437,An 'illogical' progression in Burnham's / Spock's relationship?,"Last night I was thinking back on how I've enjoyed the building of Burnham and Spock's relationship, how it felt genuine and sincere, and how I really was rooting for them. However, I hit a snag.

Spock and Burnham's relationship ruptured when Burnham ran away from home, telling Spock that she didn't love him, he was a freak. Despite Spock knowing that these were the words of someone trying to get away, they were based in a certain arrogance.

Burnham runs away on the pretext the logic extremists hate her. Yet it's Spock, the 'half-breed', they hate. Burnham is an irrelevance, they would come for him whether she is there or not.

Spock hates Burnham's continued arrogance. The arrogance of that act. The arrogance of believing she could avert the Klingon war. The arrogance that in any situation she can save someone, or the ship, or the world. The vulgar illogic of it.

The core of this is that guilt she carries, that catalyst moment, of believing she could save her mother and father, while being a little girl hiding in a closet. A feeling she has never been able to shake.

It is when Spock says this to her, that wounding, which also allows them to begin to heal. When Burnham fails to eject Airiam, who will kill her, Discovery, and all life in the galaxy, Burnham comes to understand he is right.

Burnham understands she can't save everyone. Or save the world. She isn't some special figure who at every turn outshines Spock. She isn't naturally tooled to save Spock or anyone else. With this understanding, they are able to form a genuine bond and relationship. Burnham abandons the belief she is exceptional to finally be Spock's peer and capable of a real relationship.

What we then get, is the reveal that the Red Angel is Burnham's mother, and that the saving of the galaxy is inherently tired to Burnham, that it's love for Burnham which makes saving the galaxy possible, and that she is indeed the exceptional, unique key to saving trillions of lives.

Spock somehow, despite the rift between them being based on an issue with that 'exceptional Burnham complex', doesn't raise an eyebrow at this, or even make a quip. In fact they are closer for the issue between them being amplified.

So... isn't this a problem? Isn't it kind of weak for the show to address 'yeah you know, Burnham thinks shes a Mary Sue, and we kinda write her as one, but look Spock sees it and she has to come to terms with it. And so we weren't just writing a Mary Sue it's a character flaw - and she's coming to terms with it!' only to turn it up from like a 6 on the Mary Sue scale (thinking she can solve any problem, even ones outside her control) all the way up to an 11 (the entire galaxy rests on the shoulders of her and her deus ex machina mother)?

tl;dr Spock and Burnham fell out because Spock thinks Burnham has a savior complex. Spock brings this up, Burnham sees it, and they forge a new path in their relationship.

3448,"Mickey cuts her captain off mid-sentence: ""Speculating about what the signals could mean or who created them is unproductive.""","Pike then politely says: ""What are you suggesting, commander.""

Mickey says: ""I am asserting \[...\] has proven to be a colossal waste of time.""

Are the writers really trying to make Mickey look like a characteristic leader and strong female? Or as an unlikable emotionally unstable, tragic hero; a victim of her own talent and arrogance? 

People kept asking me about examples of Mickey talking down to her crew members. Here is a very obvious one. The writers literally said to each other ""Ẅe need to open this episode with Mickey interrupting and then talking down captain Pike."" Let's have her cut him off mid sentence, lets have her use strong negative words, let's have the captain respond to her patiently and with her title.

In normal Star Trek with a normal first officer, she would patiently wait until her captain is finished and then say  ""Captain, following these signals has not been as productive as we all would have hoped. Maybe we should consider our alternatives as well.""

Pike then finally rejects Mickey, so the writers decided Pike wouldn't be convinced by her. I am just watching the episode now, so I expect that as some point Mickey will disobey orders and carry out her own plan. And probably it will work and everyone will say ""You are so amazing, Micheal."" ""It is all about you, Micheal.""

I find this deeply disturbing. I am going to hold off for now, but if this does pass, why is this who celebrating a narcissist for being a narcissist? Is this an anti-SJW anti #metoo show?

3462,[Spoilers] Dissapointed in season 2 so far of Discovery,"Finished season 1 and was not that impressed. Was excited about the arrival of a new captain and his officers. Captain Pike is amazing as usual but, I've been looking for the name of the guy in blue that accompanies him off the Enterprise when he's on the Discovery. Anyways I didn't catch his name because he barely lived 1/2 the episode and, I've watched another pretty bland 8 episodes after. He was killed off while on a mission with Pike and Burnham. I must say he was pending to be someone I wouldve really liked, he's the only person oosing any type of testosterone on that entire ship and no, I don't consider Ash Tyler any kind of man at all. He's almost a pointless character to be honest. I feel it was an injustice to kill off a good right hand for Pike even though the series tried to play him off as arrogant. Pike barely cared at his loss also it was almost sad. Then it became clear why they had to kill him off. So that Tyler can come back on a bogus excuse even though he murdered a doctor -even though he came back (loved that the doc came back by the way). Also so that Spock could have a place on the Discovery with dear sister Michael. So i guess my man in blue was an inconvenience that had to be dealt with quickly. It's almost like manly men are shunned on the series as a whole. Still a pretty good show though because I'm a sucker for sci-fi and love the visuals that CBS is doing for the show but, can't help but feel he (dude in blue who died in ep.1) could've a great feat to the show. Now I'm stuck watching the ""filler man"" Tyler -_-. You guys can be mad all you want but you have to admit they are trying to make his character so relevant and its utterly annoying, his reasons for being on the Discovery are just ridiculous as if they couldn't send anyone else in his place but, evil Georgiouh. This series has a terrible tenacity of recycling dead characters. Anyways i digress. They shouldn't have killed him off (random guy in blue) and Tyler has no place on the Discovery.

3468,How the sphere changed Control (Discovery spoilers),"Okay, so I know there's a lot of talk floating around speculating about whether or not Control is going to be a Borg origin story, and I definitely got the vibe that the writers were teasing at that, too. 


Control tells Leland ""struggle is pointless"" directly before injecting him with a bunch of glowing green nanoprobes that assimilate all his memories and take control of his body. We've all watched enough Star Trek to notice that this is really, REALLY similar to a classic Trek villain who likes to say ""resistance is futile"" before doing much the same thing.



However, this cannot be a Borg origin story because that would contradict established canon on several points. It's already known that the Borg originated in the Delta quadrant, that the Borg collective existed before humanity developed warp drive, and that the Federation was unaware of the collective's existence until Q placed the Enterprise-D in contact with them. The Borg originating in the alpha quadrant in the twenty third century and being part of a major conflict with starfleet flies in the face of all of that. It's the wrong part of the galaxy, the wrong point in history, and Starfleet command is aware that it's happening.



So far Discovery has taken care to honor the canon established by previous series, and I don't see reason to believe that they're going to toss a retcon as massive as ""starfleet initially built the Borg"" into the mix here. Yet, the similarity to the Borg seems so obvious that I also find it hard to believe the writers did it by accident.


Here's what I think may be the case. For most of its existence, Control was only taking over hardware and it used holograms and video communication to fake images of the people it wanted to impersonate. Commander Ariam already had a brain that was heavily integrated with cybernetics which allowed Control to make her its first mole in Starfleet. So why didn't Control ever try to take over section 31 personnel earlier? Because it *couldn't* yet. Ariam was the first humanoid Control encountered with enough built in technology for it to take over.



Though Ariam was identified and control's plot with her was ultimately foiled, Discovery was not able to stop the data transfer from the sphere until Control had already received 30% of its data. Not everything it wanted, but still a very substantial information. It is only after the incident with Ariam that control starts using nanotechnology to infect people who have no implants. This implies that Control obtained the knowledge of how to do that from the sphere. 



The amount of information stored within the sphere is said to be utterly massive, an archive that spans the galaxy. Given that the Borg are already the dominant power of the delta quadrant at this time, it seems plausible to me that a being as knowledgeable as the sphere would be aware of them. So what if the nanoprobes are Borg technology that control has simply copied? Something the sphere knew about and Control saw use in.



Control's not the origin of the Borg collective or even a part of it, but perhaps its assimilation technology is ultimately Borg in origin? I don't want to speculate too far past this because it's mostly just guesswork. However, it does seem reasonable to assume that Control's nanotechnology was part of the sphere data which the AI has already contained, and the writers seemed to be really obviously shouting ""does this remind you guys of something!?"" while Leland was getting injected. What's everybody else think?",startrek,1554508596,Lemonwizard,16,20,True,2019-04-05
3469,"[Spoilers] No, not the Borg. Not even similar.","It is an illogical assumption, I think.

For starters the Borg are cybernetic, requiring both the organic and technological components to function.

Control is an AI that seems to use any platform available, be it a ship or nanomachines.

The Borg transform assimilated creatures into host-drones, Control, based on the dialogue, transforms them into something akin to mannequins or puppets.

Just because it used nanomachines doesn't necessarily make it Borg. I mean, we're already experimenting with primitive nanotech these days, it's likely the Federation would have something a bit more sophisticated.

Although a possible connection, I concede, is that as it initially had Sphere data uploaded (who has been observing various species for millennia), that particular tech may havr been ""inspired"" in-universe.

3473,"What if time does, in fact, have a will (a theory on personal hell, fixed points in time, DSC S2 spoilers)","Something has been on my mind since we saw Doctor Burnham. The way she spoke really shoot something loose, in my mind. 

She spoke about time like it was sentient. She even said that it had a will, and she's not the first person to say that. Tolian Soren told Picard that time was ""*a predator*"". Annorax told Chakotay that time had ""moods"". 

It seems like all of the major characters who get stuck in time get this insight about it. Almost Doctor Who-esque if you ask me.

My basic question is, what is time does in fact ""*have a will*"". Hell, what is time crystals themselves are not just some object, but a kind of *crystalline life form* (in the same way that the spores have sentience), that have the power to manipulate time to the wishes of a person -- but only for a price. See, I'm getting this idea from watching what happens to Chris Pike in the latest Discovery episode. He touches a time crystal, and he is shown a terrible, horrible future. He is offered the chance to *walk away and avoid that future*, or, if he chooses to take the crystal, it becomes a fixed, unavoidable point in time.

See, Chris isn't the first person in Discovery to have a time crystal. He's the third, by my count. And each person who had one seemed to follow a pattern.

(1) Harcourt Fenton Mudd uses a time crystal. He uses it to loop the same hour over and over again. He has some success, but overall, he fails in the end. He thinks he has the perfect future, and instead, ends up in what he considers to be a living nightmare -- stuck with Stella.

(2) Doctor Burnham uses a time crystal to escape death at the hands of the Klingons. She is sent to a future that is a living nightmare -- the galaxy has been destroyed, and she is alone in time. She also some success, she goes back, she changes details, but she always returns to that future no matter what she does. That is **her personal, forever** future, as ... punishment? Payment? For making a deal with a time crystal.

(3) And of course, Captain Pike. Not much needs to be said here. The crystal was pretty upfront with him to begin with, ""*Here's your living nightmare, here's your personal hell if you choose to do business with me*""

This would actually mean that Discovery has avenues to beat control, to be honest. It's possible that ""**the future**"", aka, *the future for the galaxy* **can** be rewritten. But for Doctor Burnham, Chris Pike, and Harry Mudd, *their future's* have become **fixed**.

tl;dr: Time is a predator, and the time crystals are demons, or something. They let you control time, but they doom you to a personal hell that is like a custom timeline just for you.",startrek,1554513406,stuck_on_simple_tor,10,28,True,2019-04-05

3479,Discovery's treatment of technology and Starfleet tactics,"Call it nitpicking if you want, but I'm always bothered by how Discovery chooses to use technology and Starfleet tactics. Very little of it makes sense chronologically and the show treats them more like a magical quick fix, far more eager to make things look cool than adhering to pre established information. 

What I mean by this is that they use scifi tech as an answer to many things, while completely disregarding what previous shows have established to be true. 

Bridge holograms pre DS9? Check
Communication badges pre TNG? Check
Time travel without the use of anomalies pre Voyager? Check
Nanotech on par with the Borg before Starfleet makes first contact with the Borg? Check

This is how you treat magic, because it's less well defined compared to technology. Starfleet tactics also underwent similar treatment.

""The Federation doesn't permit the use of mines"", but then apparently changes their minds by DS9.
Section 31 doesn't have ships, but then does.
Section 31 is super secret, until a whole ton of people know about them.

I wouldn't really mind these inconsistencies if it was just a couple, but these are just the ones I noticed in season 2. I haven't even brought up all the ones from S1. I thought Star Trek prided itself on consistency, even in different series and different eras. Changing this for the sake of having ""cool things"", (ask yourself if the show really needed to have bridge holograms) smacks less of the science fiction genre and more like lazy writing.

Are there good things about Discovery? Of course there are, but I have never gotten the impression that the people currently in charge of making the show are actually fans, because they're far too eager to change established canon for the sake of producing coolness or artificial drama. There is always room for making changes in the Star Trek universe, but piling it all on and expecting a viewer to believe that it all changes by the time we reach TNG/DS9/Voy era is expecting a whole lot from suspension of disbelief.",startrek,1554521158,janusvaliant,34,0,True,2019-04-05

It's a bit simpler than the standard Disco uniform, and looks like it fits looser than the Enterprise uniforms. Hard to tell what colour it is due to the lighting in the scenes, but it's probably a light grey or blue.

His badge is different, too. We don't get a clear enough look, so it might just be a combination of the existing Disco admiral's badge, and the Enterprise crew badge.

The epaulettes and piping are actually pretty reminiscent of the [dress uniforms from 'Into Darkness'], but I like this version a lot more.

We know at the time in which the vision takes place Pike had the rank of fleet captain, so this would likely be the uniform for that, or for an academy instructor.

3490,The worst thing the writers did this season was introduce Pike [please read before lobbing downvotes],"Before I launch into the meat of it all, here's my main argument: the writers introduced probably the best character into the show, and they'll have to remove him in order to fit canon.

So, if there's one thing that people who both like and hate Disco can agree on, it's that Pike is a good character. He pretty much fits the standard for a good Starfleet captain: selfless, judicious, putting the good of the crew above all else, but also able to see beyond the issues of one ship to the bigger problems that might be happening outside both his head and the walls of the ship. 

And as the longtime Trek fans know, he's going to get the shortest possible end of the stick for a while until The Menagerie. Before that, however, he still has to have more time on the Enterprise that will lead to the eventual handoff to good old /u/williamshatner. And as the writers and producers have confirmed, Anson Mount is only on for one season. (Which makes me so damn pissed they didn't set this show after Nemesis because then there wouldn't be this problem, but that's another frustration to air another time.)

And then, once Pike leaves, we're left with a Pike-shaped hole in the captain's chair. Saru has been mostly offscreen this season with the exception of the episodes about his home planet, Burnham is... and then there's basically no one else to take command because, well, there isn't. I don't expect any of the reaction shot bridge crew to suddenly become lieutenant commanders.

And bringing in a new captain for the next season makes it seem as if the chair is cursed, like it's the defense against the dark arts post at Hogwarts.

It leaves the show tonally inconsistent because the captain is the one who sets the tone and the standard. The person is the anchor on which the show finds its moral and emotional grounding, which has also been a problem giving that role to Burnham (yet another long post). Pike filled that role pretty well, but again, the captain's chair on Disco is a saloon door. 

I was never a fan of bringing in classic characters because of numerous reasons, though I never expected this to be one of them. But again, it leaves a charismatic gap in the show, and honestly the best piece, because when Pike is gone, he's gone.",startrek,1554548607,josephgordonreddit,98,65,True,2019-04-06

3507,Star Trek The Next Generation Statistics!,"In ""preparation"" for the Picard series that's still a while off I thought I might re-watch the whole TNG show from start to finish and I'll probably include the TNG movies as well.
And I thought it might be fun to gather some statistics about stuff happening in the show along the way.

What would you want me to keep track of ?  
Now it must be doable, I'd love to know how much screen time each main character gets for example but that's a crazy amount of work and not something you can do while casually watching the show.  

There's a lot of information about the show to find online so gathering info that's already out there is a bit of a waste of time.  
For example there's already info about how many times there's a red/yellow alert on the show or how many times the holodeck malfunctions. But then again that doesn't happen so much that I can't keep track of.  
Also has to be something that happens somewhat regular, saucer separation probably happens only a handful of times on the show and that info is likely already to be found somewhere online.  

So what statistics about the show would you like to know ?
I'll pick a ""handful"" (10-15) suggestions that I can ""simultaneously"" jot down on a (prepared piece of) paper while casually watching the show and I'll make some interesting graphs, pie-charts, line charts etc per season or at the end of the whole show. 

Now I already have some ideas of my own that I want to keep track of;  

* Amount of times a main characters name is mentioned
* Amount of deaths, ship staff/aliens/etc ?
* Amount of separate alien species that they come across (probably already to find somewhere)
* Amount of photon torpedoes fired, amount of phaser firing (ship)

My assumption is that there was a refit between the end of Pike's last five year mission and the beginning of Kirk's, and that during that time much of the crew was reassigned - so not much continuity between crews.

In the episode “the Most Toys” Data is kidnapped by a ‘collector of rare things’ and held as prisoner.  When he is attempting his escape, he pulls a gun on his captor, a gun that is outlawed for use on the grounds it is inhumane to use it on someone because it’s a horrible way to die.

3523,Why I believe Control is the Borg and that it will tie into the Picard series,"Not only do I believe that Control evolves into the Borg, but I also believe this will tie into the upcoming Picard series, and that the Borg will be the main antagonists of said series.  Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

Control, the AI that gives orders to Section 31 in DISCO, derives from the book *Control,* a Section 31 novel by David Mack (synopsis [here](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Control) ).  In the book, much like in DISCO, Control is the name of an AI network that gives orders to Section 31.  The actual story of Control in the book is quite different than its story on DISCO, involving Data and Julian Bashir battling the AI in their timeline after it has thrived for 200 years.  But this shows that Star Trek writers are willing to take concepts from the novels and work them into the television plot lines, as *Control* was written and released several months before the first episodes of Discovery aired.  David Mack is also no stranger to writing for the television shows, having written two episodes of Deep Space 9 and for various other Star Trek properties, and has already worked alongside Discovery writers while writing novels set in that particular storyline (which you can read in the AMA I linked below).

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I believe Control are the precursor to the Borg are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

First, if it looks like a duck (green assimilating nanomodules) and quacks like a duck (Struggle is Pointless)... but I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been reported several places ([here](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/title-new-picard-star-trek-series/) and [here](https://www.tgtrek.com/2018/08/rumors-svelato-il-titolo-della-nuova.html?m=1#.W3FEMXqhX08.facebook) and [here](https://trekmovie.com/2019/03/04/more-production-details-for-star-trek-picard-series-emerge-including-possible-title/), for instance) that the name of one of the upcoming shows, very possibly the Picard show, is *Star Trek: Destiny*.  This is important because *Star Trek: Destiny* is also a book trilogy, also written by David Mack, that concludes the Borg plotline from The Next Generation, Voyager, and First Contact.  The book spans two distinct time frames, the first being the Enterprise timeframe, in which the USS Columbia inadvertently create the Borg (very highly summarized), and several months after Nemesis, where the Borg have launched a full scale assault and the Alpha and Beta quadrants, intent on annihilation, as opposed to assimilation.  The reason for annihilation is basically in response to Captain Janeway's actions in Voyager, resulting in the Borg regarding the Federation as a direct threat to the Collective.  Picard is a major player in these novels, due to his past experiences with the Borg.  I won't try to summarize the books here, as there is a LOT going on in those novels, but you can read the summaries of the three books [here](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Gods_of_Night) [here](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Mere_Mortals) and [here](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Lost_Souls), rescpectively.  The books are also very good, imo, and I would highly recommend them.  My main point, though, is that it ties the Enterprise timeline in with the post-nemesis timeline, where the Borg are the main antagonists.  I believe the writers are doing something similar, but using the Discovery instead of the Columbia.  This gives us a version of the Borg origin story needed in order to do some version of *Destiny* on screen.   In the books, it was &gt;!Captain Hernandez of the Columbia who ended up defeating the Borg!&lt;.  I'm theorizing that something similar will happen in the television version of *Destiny*.  Perhaps Burnham's mom becomes the Borg queen, and she goes forward in time and defeats the Borg with the power of love or something, I don't know.  But I do believe the two will tie in together much like the Enterprise and Post-Nemisis timelines do in the *Destiny* books.  We know that they will adapt stories from the books, this author specifically, and a Borg origin story involving the Federation is key to the *Destiny* storyline.

&amp;#x200B;

In David Mack's Reddit AMA, linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7uj2fv/im_david_mack_author_of_the_midnight_front_ask_me/), there are a few other interesting things that may suggest that they are using ideas from his *Destiny* novels.  I don't know how to link the exact comments, but when asked:

"" Having wrote episodes of DS9 and some of the greatest trek novels ever, would you like to work on Discovery, or had any premises for your own trek series?,"" he answered, "" My lawyer and agent both inform me that I need to duck this question.""

&amp;#x200B;

When asked, "" For something like \[*Star Trek: Destiny*\], do the powers that be pitch the universe's direction for next couple of years and then you pitch back who and what you want to blow up? Or is there more control from one end vs the other?,"" he answered, "" I pitched it to the editors and sold them on its virtues; they, in turn, pitched it to the licensor (i.e., *Star Trek* Licensing), and the only question that came back was, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" We said yes, and **the team at CBS Television** has supported us all the way.""

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to believe that he will have a hand in the supposed upcoming (supposed) *Destiny* series.  If they do adapt the *Destiny* storyline, then perhaps the events of Discovery with Control will be instrumental to defeating the Borg threat on the *Destiny* show, much like the Enterprise-era events and characters were key in the novels.

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe the Picard show will follow the formula set forth in the *Destiny* novels because the Borg are a major part of his character.  It would simply make sense for a Picard-centric series to conclude the Borg storyline.  The Next Generation had four storylines that took place over the course of the series (maybe more that I'm not remembering):  the Klingon stuff, the Romulan stuff, Q, and the Borg.  Almost everything else was episodic.  The Klingon and Romulan storylines were mostly resolved, leaving Q and the Borg.  I believe both Q and the Borg will be huge parts of the *Destiny* show; in fact, I believe Q was testing or preparing Picard for the events of a supposed *Destiny* show.  But I digress, and now I'm just spitballing (Q wasn't in the *Destiny* novels, if I remember correctly).  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Discovery has already adapted from the novels, a television series has been trademarked sharing a name with a popular trilogy from the same author where the Borg are a major antagonist and where a Borg origin story where they are created by the Federation pre-TOS is key to the story.  Not to mention Control assimilates people with green nanomodules, just sayin.

To that end, I was pretty happy to see him back in Season 2 as Kol'Sha, I knew it was him right away through some fairly distinctive mannerisms. I was overjoyed to see him back this week as Tinavek and thought is this guy going to be Discovery's Jeffrey Combs?

3530,(Spoilers) My personal issue with Michael B. (Discovery),"I don't hate the character or the actor. And I know the creators said early on this show would focus from the perspective of one main character who wasn't the captain, so that is what it is and won't likely change.

But the thing I think Michael needs in order to be more enjoyable and more relatable..... Is a bit more humour or witty'ness. Some more personality. 

Everything is always so serious or dramatic. I understand the situations in the show are serious and dramatic, but even Spock has more humour and smart remarks thrown around than she does.

Even Worf had more funny moments. 

And yes, she was raised on Vulcan and brought up the Vulcan way and yes, she once in a while will throw something snarky here and there, but it's rare.

Its always serious. It's always dramatic. It's always philosophical. It's always dictating values to the viewer.

If there were more scenes like when Spock suggested the Red Angel fit her personality profile and essentially embarrassed her in front of everyone and then she Sarcastically thanked him for sharing that with everyone, it'd make her more relatable.

I almost thought that moment and Spock coming on board would help her open up from her Uber professional she'll a bit and allow her to be a bit more humorous.

I know I know.... Her life is tragic, she's had hard times, she tries to put the entire galaxy onto her shoulders and needs to fix everything.

But just give the actor and the character a bit more to work with outside of being betrayed, the end of the universe, her mutiny, constant seriousness or intellectual combat with others.

Even if it was just a 2 min scene off duty here and there where it's not constant life and death.

Let us get to actually ""Know"" the character outside of her tragedies and her duty. Let us see some actual personality.

They started to when she was getting with Ash in Season 1.... And they did a little bit here and there with Spock and their sibling bickering. I loved the annoyed grunt she gave when Spock decided he was going with her in the shuttlecraft.

I just feel we need more of that. ",startrek,1554622056,Praxius,60,66,True,2019-04-07

3534,Something I noticed relating to Spock and Control when rewatching the Menagerie [Disco and TOS spoilers],"So I just rewatched the Menagerie in light of Pike's character development over this season of Disco. Which I highly recommend by the way; it adds a lot to the character. But I noticed that when Spock is hijacking the Enterprise he uses a lot of the exact same tactics that Control does in Disco. He falsifies Kirk's voice, along with some others, and uses them to send false order to the Enterprise. Just like some of the characters talked about Control being able to falsify commands and transmissions for any admirals or Starfleet personnel. He then rigs the ship to only be controlled by Control so that no one can divert its course from Talos IV, which is pretty similar to how we've seen Control behave in Disco. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's fully intentional, but it's a decent head canon that Spock adapted some of the tactics he saw a rogue AI use years before to get Pike to Talos IV.",startrek,1554632203,usernamefamineman,29,68,True,2019-04-07

3536,"A missed opportunity, making Seven a Borg Queen","I just watched finished watching the two part Voyager episode Dark Frontier and in it, Seven of Nine has a discussion with the Borg Queen:

Borg Queen : Congratulations.
Seven of Nine : Regarding?
Borg Queen : Assimilation is complete.
Seven of Nine : 300,000 individuals have been transformed into drones. Should they be congratulated as well?
Borg Queen : They should be. They've left behind their trivial, selfish lives, and they've been reborn with a greater purpose. We've delivered them from chaos into order.
Seven of Nine : Comforting words. Use them next time instead of ""Resistance is futile"". You may elicit a few volunteers.

I was thinking about a perfect finale of Voyager instead of the Endgame episode we got.

Instead of crippling the Borg like in the end of Endgame, instead, Seven rejoins the Borg Collective and allows Voyager back into the Alpha Quadrant and later, we learn that Seven dethroned the Borg Queen and makes the Borg benevolent, and under Seven, the Borg doesn't force assimilation on everyone, but seeks volunteers and restores the worlds destroyed by the Borg, like Guinan's world and people for example, and under Seven, the Borg is still a hive mind, but is allowed individuality.

And in the last scene, Seven's parents' individuality is restored and they are reunited with Seven.

3537,Does anyone like the Lwaxana episodes?,"Several months ago, I decided that I would watch all TNG era episodes/movies in the order they aired. I just watched DS9's Emissary last night after finishing  TNG's Chain of Command earlier in the day for example.

One thing I've noticed is that season 1 and 2 of TNG actually aren't as bad on the whole as I remembered them being. There's actually some really good episodes in there.

However, every time I get to an episode with Troi's mother, I find myself cringing throughout most of it. Perhaps the best Lwaxana episode is Half a Life, but even in that episode many of her scenes make me extremely uncomfortable. I think the episode is strong in spite of her presence rather than because of it.

This ""project"" of mine to watch everything in airdate order feels like it's taking longer than it could because when I know the next episode involves Lwaxana, I tend to put off watching it for a week or more.

Ever since legal slavery got abolished way back in American History. Since slavery is still legal for prisoners. Some states offer more or less 30 cents per hour as wage. But some pay nothing at all. Which is all perfectly legal.

I don't know too much about Star Trek. Mainly from watching all the movies - old and new. So I found episode 3 pretty damn disturbing. I'm now done with episode 4. But I'm still a bit confused about how this show (Star Trek franchise in general) approaches penal slavery as part of Starfleet. Is this normal for the Star Trek world? At the very least, she's given a choice at the end of the episode. However, during the episode as she gets started with the science crew, it's clear she has no choice.

3558,My Story and some other stuff..," 

Alright guys and gals and what ever else you may identify as, lol... This is mainly Trek in general related but is part of Discovery so first off let me give you background on my Trek lore knowledge and know how ok...

I am gonna be 35 come july 4th this year, I have been watching Trek since the premiere of TNG and was ALWAYs there for next weeks episode for every Trek that followed then I wanted to learn their roots and where it all began so I watched TOS, and have every movie some was able to see in on the big screen some not... still Trek to me is a big big part of my life as we all have had good times and bad but one constant was always there other then direct family or the odd friend but it was Trek either new episode or rerun it was always there... see I have a huge problem something that I am jealous of all you core fans or kelvin fans or any kind of fan new or old it's part of what is wrong with me as a whole it is what the y ""memory retention"" not 110% sure what its about or the severity of it but it blows cause I see soooo many post among so many trek groups that I wanna comment on or a debate to take part of and I cant cause I cant like you guys at times recall even the smallest detail of something at times or like something that bleeds over to one of the other series or something in one of the movies that is a cool call back to an old episode or 2... that said i'm not saying that I dont know my trek cause I do its more so that when I hit the memory recall button my brain acts like a stoner and is all like "" nah, man I dun wanna move today"" so sorry for the french but it F\*n sucks, but with this post I will post pics of my collection not only to prove I know my shit but also to show yeahs that I grew up on Trek border lined obsessive almost like when Stewie kidnapped the TNG actors and well yeah know how that went lol...like between Ghostbusters and turtles Trek was there for Xmas, easter , bdays like anything toy, model, frank mint collectible or other wise collectible I had it my mom worked stupid hard for me and my sister and brother to have what we had growing up and that in its self wasn't overly much but mom seen how trek made an impact on my life and saw how it affected how I seen the world and what its about... as I grew older we had to move ALOT started in Ontario ended up in Nova Scotia only for me to move back to Ontario, London actually with nothing but 2 duffle bags and maybe like my phone and 60 bucks... I lost... all of it or at least a HUGE portion of it all but after living on the street here and getting in to all sorts of shenanigans I started seeing kids that were mine come in to my life so I turned it around started working towards stability and like a real life again... Trek helped me get through that, all of it good and bad AS well.... but I got to a point where I said I want what I haad back in life related to trek so I did it as the pics will show it, it took a pretty short period of time to get what I have back, but shhhh! dont tell their moms my kids 2 daughters 9 and 10 and my son 12 they all watch it all with me new and old, pretty cool eh....

now with that being said Discovery....  
All I have to say is WOW!!!

First off season 1 yeah sure I haad my gripes about certain things but I moved past it cause it was Trek and like the kelvin movies I liked it it was mainly changed the way they did sure some corporate sh!t more then likely but mainly to draw new fans to our vast collective Trek has built in this world... but I am gonna go out on limb and assume every one has seen the 1st season here so let get to the main thing here

S2

number 1... S2 as a whole is great so far every episode reminded me of like episodes from older series fight me over it go ahead but I wanna hope TRUE fans can see that they clearly listened to us fans with what we felt was off last season and worked towards fixing some stuff and like yeha know what I mean though and like the overall season story arc they have led up to I think will end in explaining why and how Micheal is the apparent adoptive child of Sarak and Amanda and why they built Discovery in the first place and why the war was started and happened when it did cause in the books you'll see in my pics here it states that I am pretty sure the earth-Klingon war did't happen at the Binary nor in the time frame that episode was set in so it leads me to speculate that the season were in is going to explain the Time Paradox her mom has created due to a chain of events caused by S31 and their experiments in the past and maybe maybe when her mom and dad were presumed dead she gets sent to Vulcan to live with Spock and them but when that placed gets bombed and she runs away and the Red Angel confronts Spock to save Micheal it creates a paradox event that then sent in to motion every thing we have learned up to this point on the show... that said about Control I seen a similar post from this group about how control is named Control in the redditversse some where, the OP said that ""Control is called Control cause the show runners didn't wanna out themselves for making a solid origin to the Borg and wanted to fans to come to that conclusion by the last Act of the season final where it would depict a seen in the very distant past connnecting it somehow to the borg and there yeah have it...""... I read that and the rest of the thread and I like lost IQ points like are you guys flat eathers to lol.

now Pike and Spock.... what can I say about that duo for alot of it I am speechless...

Pike for one k... Anson mount has completely sold me on the character thru and thru to the point that if Mr. Hunter in the Cage had the real chance to play out the role and still to the point of his tragic end for character depth and what not Anson mount in my honest opinion has won me over to think that is how pike would have been played out, just they acting alone but in that is like the way he presents him self as pike on the bridge towards his fellows shipmates like how talks and how he smirks and just how tall he seems in the captains chair and soon like the goosebumbs will be like packing and leaving my skin cause we will get to see him sit in the real chair next episode... like I had strong feels during that pike scene in the monastery like know what I know of pike from the cage and his return to Talos 4 and from books or comics that had some from of version written bout his life...

Well as for another version Spock in my life time alone lol...

Spock is one of if not in my top 5 favorite fictional characters of all time like from this point in time today as i type this out dating back to like say I dunno adam and eve or what ever origin of humanity you believe in like top 5 hands down...

Ethan Peck thus has shown me a side of the Spock I know that sure maybe is new for this series and story they are building with Discovery as a whole but it is information to me that makes perfect sense about Spock as a whole to me and fills gaps in his story I feel are an added bonus to the character like I dunno I have to see any official news saying he was done after this season is up but would it not be uber cool for him to stay on for at least S3 to like develop his and micheals clearly new found and looks pretty fixed relationship but also like in his off time kept in constant contact with pike that way to show us the loyalty and honor and what have you towards that man when he take a broken man to Talos 4 to finish his life in complete peace.. I just think when they actually brought him on screen we were getting close to season final as it seeing what 2 episodes left and to be honest I enjoy the main cast but I kinda wanna see more Spock...

all that said in the world today we see so much hate and war and hunger and every that goes against what the great bird in the sky saw for humanity and it kills me that I can be that observant and like I dunno there are a few other words to use but my memory thing is hitting a wall right now and it suck but that said like I stated trek keeps me up going past all of it and I live a pretty decent life to like not give a damn about it all but I pay attention to it all to be able to make informed choices and such and be able to teach my kids the real meaning of peace and love and working together in hopes they will take it as they grow older and new generation will adapt to be the better world he foresaw for us...

So please guys and gals I get it, its new trek some concepts in it were not used to seeing on a constant basis in our beloved franchise, like its 2019 here people the 21st C here people get over your self's like honestly, we have homosexuality, we have flat eathers stil to this day lol, we have people that believe in majics still, like hell people can identify as what ever they want hopefully with in reason maybe and document that shit on actual gov. paperwork like how are you not expecting trek to modernize like its doing like 60 years ago was a different era when trek started so like of course its going to take from that point in modern life with the future aspects and trek history it incorporated... respect the past and embrace the future people maybe help by not bashing the hell out of this cause if CBS randomly states they are done with trek cause they cant bend over for every little detail so your gonna go all star wars fanboy on them and boycott it and they just like pretend trek dont exsist I will come on this super highway find out everything BOUT YOU AND MAKE IT LIKE YOU DONT EXSIST(LOL KIDDING i DONT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT KINDA POWER TO DO IT ).... but wouldnt it make you feel uber stupid if us fans kicked up a horrible stink about how someones hair looked or oh know its 2019 and its a fictional depicting the utopia style of humanity among the stars and that guy just kissed another guy and then bam all trek was gone for good cause people couldn't adapt and grow with and let it be its thing.... lets help make the world a better people and all get along and be good cause who knows when it all will be gone and then what cause we now have this and I seem to remeber what 5 other shows in the works for CBS and trust me ma they paramount cooking something or 2 for the big screen... this few years are gonna be huge for trek maybe possibly trump those marvels and what they got the last 11 years heck even DC to suck it all of you other attempts built franchises were making a huge come back and were all over the time line with it

sorrys its long I know there are many mistakes and what have so dont be a troll bout it and take it for what it is and like I dunno be kind dammit

If you look beyond Patrick Stewart trying to find the character of Picard, and some initial chemistry problems (they don't seem comfortable with each other in the first season), they're really charming seasons. If anything, I think a lot of season 6 and 7 are weak compared to these ones.

As we've looked around, there's a lot of Star Wars stuff aimed at kids, even babies, but not so much when it comes to Star Trek. She found some awesome crib sheets, mobiles, etc. for her Star Wars side. I found plenty of toys and clothes but very few things in terms of decorative items like sheets and mobiles that looked good and weren't ludicrously priced (mostly they looked bad and were also crazy expensive). 

Eventually I decided to create my own mobile. I found a mobile that I liked the look of, was affordable, and had good reviews, and then removed the friendly woodland critters and replaced them with Hallmark ornament ships:

Streaming Dates ARE FINALLY HERE!!


DS9 Fans!
 
We've got a star-shipload of exciting information starting to leak out about the film's upcoming release (hint, hint, keep an eye out tomorrow for something really cool), but we expect nothing should be more welcome news to you than the following long-awaited announcement...
 
EARLY STREAMING DATES ARE SET FOR OUR BACKERS!
You’ve been waiting patiently, and we’re proud to finally share that as of last week, the film is COMPLETELY DONE, and handed off to our distributors over at Shout! Studios.
 
Yes. This thing is really happening.
 
As we’ve promised to you from the start, we've made sure you’ll be among the first to see it — BEFORE it appears in theaters!
And whats more…
 
You’ll be seeing it LATER THIS MONTH!

That's right. Our early backer stream of the film will debut worldwide on Thursday, April 25th at 9:09pm EST. Eligible backers will be able to stream it from home or on your mobile devices as many times as you like for the following 99 hours (notice a theme?).
 
The idea behind this reward was to give backers a sneak peak at the movie before the general public could see it in theaters, hence the limited time window. Of course, you’ll still have many more chances to watch it at your leisure when your DVD/Blu-ray combo set ships (stay tuned for details on that AFTER our theatrical release!).

3580,Enterprise and the deal with Discovery,"Hey all,

So yea, I basically grew up watching Voyager and Enterprise. Now onto Discovery, but I've never really watched anything else.

I liked Enterprise Season 1-3, but not s4 (it was pure garbage and I sort of regret petitioning for a s4 at the time!). 

I liked ENT and VOY  because of the linear aspects to them... Each episode was like a mini episode with a larger theme to it. They had a lot of character development in between and we got to learn about many of the crew members. I can literally pick up ANY VOY and (to a slightly lesser extent) ENT episode and just appreciate it as a single 45minute video.

But with Discovery I don't feel that I could just go back and watch any of the episodes in isolation. It isn't *bad* in terms of an ongoing story and it does just about keep me interested, but I'm really not feeling it as something which will stand the test of time.

Also, I'm a bit miffed that the focus will be very much on Pike and Spock when Burnham is HOPEFULLY killed off. I mean I appreciate the links to other Star Trek series, especially when it comes to what happens with Spock and Pike (and the latest episode with the vision was cool) but I just don't like how ENT has seemingly been neglected a bit.

I think the only real mentions of ENT in DISC have been when Siru asked the computer to list notable Captains and they mentioned Archer, and then a brief mention of the Defiant in relation to the Mirror Universe (but maybe that wasn't related?).

Have I potentially missed any other ENT references in DISC?

But yea, I am a bit disappointed that, despite a lot of this season focusing on TIME TRAVEL, there hasn't been much reference to ENT and maybe the temporal cold war etc.",startrek,1554758777,Thermic_Marlin,2,0,True,2019-04-08

3582,I feel like the weirdest Star Trek fan in the world,"So I'll preface this by saying that growing up I was a Star Wars nerd and naturally had zero interest in star trek because they didn't have Lazer swords or podracing. However after hearing the praise The Orville has been getting and the fact that I'm older now and would probably appreciate star trek a lot more I figured what the hell I'll give it a shot.

So instead of just watching The Orville cuz that's what I was mainly interested in. I decided it would be more, logical 😉, to watch every single bit of Star trek content that exists, and then watch The Orville so I can understand subtle references and what not. 

Fast forward to about a year ago when I finally give TOS a shot. And I absolutely fucking...LOVED IT. I'm more of a fan of TOS series now than I am of most science fiction I've seen, in any and every aspect. I adore this show with a great passion. It took a while to finally finish all 3 seasons(college and life and shit) but finally a couple months ago I knocked out TOS and even watched every movie featuring that crew. I seriously can't state in words just how much I love this show. 

So naturally after finishing TOS, TAS, and the motion pictures. I decided to move onto TNG. And for the life of me I can't enjoy it. I don't like the characters, everything feels to... professional I guess you could say. And I suppose that means part of why I love TOS so much is the campiness of it all but that can't possibly be all because the movies were vastly different from the series and I still thoroughly enjoyed them. I'm absolutely still gonna continue watching and hope my feelings change as time goes on but from what I've read everyone fucking loves TNG and it's like the greatest Star Trek series ever made, and hopefully someday I'll agree but for now I just feel like a weird star trek fan that likes a very niche portion of a wider universe.",startrek,1554761305,CyKoToaster,174,66,True,2019-04-08

3593,"Discovery’s problem with developing tertiary bridge characters (Potential spoilers, but not talked about directly)","Now I’m not entirely sure if this is an issue (as I’ll explain later, but just something I’ve noticed and wanted a discussion about) but something I’ve noticed is that out of the main bridge crew, I know very little about a lot of them. Now on the bridge (in this season at least) we have had 8 different officers (if i miss someone out this just further proves my point), Pike, Saru, Burnham, robot woman, cybernetic (pilot?) woman, black (also pilot?) woman, comm guy, and robot woman’s replacement. 

Now at this point I should say, I’ve watched Discovery’s season 1 twice now, and I rewatch the last episode before watching the new one of that week, so I wouldn’t exactly say that I’m a light viewer, yet without looking on the wiki, I can’t even tell you over half of the bridge crews names. As I’m sure, I could go on the wiki and find out a bit more about the characters, but for the most part they are essentially just nameless extras that happen to have a few lines. These characters have little to no personality, and I can’t even remember their names. This leads to at least one problem I’ve identified, for example when we learnt more about the robot woman (aereyan? ariyan?) i guessed exactly what her fate would be later in the episode about five minutes in. The problem is that I know so little about the characters, that when all of a sudden we get to know their name, backstory, relationship status, and get lots of more personal scenes (such as hanging out with the other officers) you might as well be stamping on their forehead what’s about to happen (plus I know even less about her replacement, I don’t even have a clue what her name is or anything about her). 

Now for an example, Comm officer, Ensign Hoshi Sato from ENT vs the comm guy from DIS. (I see that ENT gets a lot of hate/scorn from this sub for some reason, but I’m just using it as an example since I’m most familiar with it even though it’s been a good 5 years since I’ve watched it) I know her name for starters, which is more than I can say for DIS comm guy, I know that she was teaching Vulcan(?) in Brazil before she got put on ENT, I know that she takes pride in knowing a lot of languages and goes out of her way to learn new ones and expand her overall knowledge (i can’t remember exactly but they were on shore leave and there was an alien there that knew a language she didn’t and she spent the entire time of her shore leave trying to learn his language). She’s also good friends with Mayweather (the pilot who used to be a cargo ship pilot and grew up on one(just to further prove how little we know about the other two pilot women)) and actively tries to connect with T’Pol when the rest of the crew ignore her for being Vulcan. Now for DIS comm guy, I know that... he exists? I can’t recall anything about him, I’m not sure on his rank, I’ve no clue what his name is, and I have no idea about who he is as a person (the only thing I can say is that I’m pretty sure he hangs out with the two pilot women but I can’t say for sure and this is more a maybe). And for the most of the rest of them this same sentiment extends to most of the bridge crew (the only exception being the robot woman purely because we got a huge info dump on her). (Just to be clear I’m not saying that all of discovery’s characters are one dimensional, just that in comparison to other series the bridge crew seems extremely underdeveloped) (also also, if we do know a lot about them and I’m just being a dunce and forgetting, ignore the parts about knowing and change it to remembering, lol).

Now I have a couple of theories as to why this has happened. Discovery is primarily from Burnham’s point of view, and as she is not the captain this is very different from most of the previous shows we’ve gotten that do follow the captain. As a science officer, Burnham would rarely interact with someone on comms or nav, as opposed to a captain, who would interact with them both quite evenly. So this idea of having a fleshed our bridge crew might just be a hangover from having the captain as our POV and not a science officer who would be in very different circles, both socially and professionally (I think the comms guy for example is an ensign?). Or potentially, because we have so many other characters we are focusing on that aren’t on the bridge, it simply leaves less screen time for less important bridge characters. Or even more potentially, DIS hasn’t even finished its second season yet, and ENT has had double that, so it could just fall down to having had more time to flesh out the background characters (as DIS is also primarily plot focused as opposed to ENT that for the first few seasons had very little direction and was more episodic lending itself to more character driven episodes as it doesn’t feel as much that you are stopping the action since each one is more self contained)(also also also, pls don’t be mean, I’m not trying to bash or anything, I just wanted to talk about something I’ve noticed (I’m only saying this because some people can get quite defensive when mentioning specific characters)).

TLDR
In comparison to other Star Trek shows, we know/remember very little about most of the bridge crew.

What do you guys think? Do you think that not having a fleshed out bridge crew is or isn’t a problem? Have you guys even noticed it?",startrek,1554810407,CyberjenicPanda,160,22,True,2019-04-09

3597,(Spoilers) [DIS] [TOS] The Minagerie has Evidence of Discovery's Conclusion. Of All Star Trek Thus Far.,"Just watched through Part 1 of The Minagerie a few mins ago, and one scene had one line that seems prophetic to Discovery.

Before I get to this, note that the showrunners of Discovery have clearly stated that all Canon issues and holes to be filled will be done. A lot of it (perhaps all of it) is supposed to be revealed by end of this season no less.

Note that the team behind the show has a lot of trek nerds who know their sh*t. If there's a pile of us in here who think we're experts, then logically they had the ability to hire the best, or at least a handful of us. 

Lastly, note how this season has had a focus on these signals, the Red Angel, and time travel. But more obvious, it has had a focus on Talos IV, Captain Pike and Spock.

They come aboard, then we have an episode relating directly to The Cage. With the last episode, we have a direct connection to The Minagerie via the vision of Pike's fate which is explained in said episode. We know his conclusion. He knows his conclusion up until the chair.... nothing beyond. Nothing in The Minagerie is known to him.

Now the evidence is that in Part 1 of The Minagerie:

Commodore Jose Mendez: ""And to do so is the only death penalty left on our books. Only Fleet Command knows why. Not even this file explains that, but it does name the only Earth ship that ever visited the planet.""

^ The Only Earth Ship. The only Starship.

But based on Discovery, that isn't so. There would be physical records, logs and reports all over Discovery being there. They weren't completely cut off from Starfleet forever after. Even if it was kept Top Secret that Discovery was also at Talos IV.

Fleet Command would know. Starfleet Intelligence would know. Section 31 knows if they know. Saying Enterprise is the only ship to ever go there is a bold statement when they were already talking about things that were Top Secret. Why divulge Enterprise but completely leave out Discovery? 

It would be a very glaring oversight if the Discovery creators overlooked this part when deciding to directly reference this and other episodes.

And since the actors have noted their minds were blown by the ending for season 2, being Star Trek fans themselves..... There is only one logical conclusion. They are aware of this statement and since this is a popular and well known story in TOS, they're not about to retcon it.

The USS Discovery NCC-1031... And Michael Burnham is thereby wiped from the timeline.

Nobody just simply forgot about them over time. Their records were never sealed away and never spoken about again. If that were the case, then the Discovery crew must have done something down right evil.... Like Khan evil with a Starfleet badge. Spore tech and time travel isn't really up there when you consider all the other crap other series got into. 

Thats pretty unlikely at this point.

Here's how the timeline will conclude:

Pike and Spock and The Cage

Kirk and Spock and TOS/Movies

Picard and Borg and TNG

Picard and Spock and TNG

Picard and Borg and First Contact

First Contact to ENT and altered Starships and Enterprise being the name of a Starship noone heard of before. 

ENT to Discovering Borg and parts of the Borg Sphere.

Section 31 uses Borg Tech to create Control

Michael's parents attacked by Klingons, mom goes time jumping in suit created for Section 31

Michael is taken in by Sarek

Michael and Spock

Spock saves Michael guided by Red Angel

Michael starts a war with Klingons

Michael and DIS..... 

Some how, Control leads to Discovery learning about the Borg Technology and/or learn where that tech came from.

The Time Crystal is used to alter the timeline in a way that prevents the Borg from going back in time in First Contact, thus No Control, thus, No need to worry about the Sphere Data of death to all Sentient Life.

But in doing so, the timeline resets back to Pike and Spock in The Cage.

Technology didn't advance as it did through ENT and DIS, so we're back to TOS Style ships, tech and uniforms.

So that's it right?

Nope. 

Picard and Spock post First Contact, Post Nemesis 

Spock fails to stop Romulus's obliteration and is thrown back in time in a new Timeline forever lost and Presumed dead. He eventually passes away in the Kelvin Timeline.

No more Kelvin timeline to follow. 

Picard series begins in relations to the fallout of Romulus being destroyed.

....... Discovery season 3.

Thats right..... Discovery will continue on far into the future.

Discovery Captained by Saru with First Officer Michael Burnham.

Oh and stuck with them is the Enterprise captained by Pike with Number One and Spock. 

Surprise. 

The fans get everything, Canon is restored, a Picard series, a show with Pike and Spock.... Saru as Captain finally as well..... Michael saves the Universe and a show about a future beyond the TNG era. 

Which all ends with Calypso.

Where did the crew go? 

To the Enterprise, full compliment.

And Pike's future in the Minagerie? 

It's no longer his future but the past of another Pike from the original timeline.

I made a passing joke that were just gonna name our daughter Jadzia because that's one of my favorite female characters from DS9. (Major Kira is pretty awesome too though.)

We watched all of TNG during my first pregnancy with our son and then we watched DS9 through this second one. 

Now we're really struggling with names for this little girl of ours. So my partner and I have jokingly just been to referring to our daughter as Jadzia for the past few days. And I'm starting to wonder how crazy we'd seem if we actually just named her that...?

My partner says he doesn't see why we can't give her that name, but I'm afraid to hear what our family members think of that odd name. (Then again my partner and son both have Hawaiian middle names that are probably more unique and harder to pronounce than Jadzia.)
 
I just wanna know what people think about sticking my daughter with a Star Trek related name for possibly the rest of her life...? I'm curious to know if anyone else has done it.",startrek,1554817361,father_dan_the_man,123,23,True,2019-04-09

Let's be real.  His relationship with Burnham feels fake, forced, and awkward.  (Let's love our attempted murders).

I'm glad Pike was smart enough (and cared enough) to see Tyler killed Culber.  Nobody else seemed to give a shit.

Every time he engages in intimacy with Burnham it is laughable.  He has become a cringe character with no real point.

3611,"Pike, the Universe and Everything: Star Trek: Discovery continuity (Potential Spoilers)","First off, I love Star Trek: Discovery. It’s so so so good! I love the actors. I love the structure. I love the decision to ditch the episodic formula. It’s damn good tv. 

Secondly, let me state for the record that continuity and canon just don’t bother me that much.  And I get annoyed when people complain about the canon. Good tv contradicts itself sometime as attitudes, effects and new writers engage the show. This is not a bad thing. 

If a story can draw on past Star Trek programs, that’s great. If there are changes to modernize the show (Pike’s condition isn’t just paralysis, Vina doesn’t stay isolated on Talos IV just because she wants to be pretty) then I’m all for it.  

I don’t care if the Klingon foreheads don’t match, or that Pike’s life support box looks different. I love that Spock’s beard reminds me of his introduction in Star Trek: the Motion Picture and that characters like Vina and the Tolosians are more fleshed out. 

In short, Discovery draws on the storytelling of the past and isn’t afraid to take narrative risks. 

But I do have some questions which I do wonder if the show will pursue:

1. If we are viewing the shows and movies as connected, did the Captain Pike of the new film series refuse to take the time crystals? Did that Pike’s choice lead to the destruction of Vulcan? 

2. Does Pike taking the crystals mean that Discovery is firmly rooted in the original television series timeline? 

2. Did anyone else get chills when the “previously on Star Trek” showed clips of the original series? It seemed like the perfect way to hit the nostalgia buttons without triggering the canon dilemma. I hope they do that again. Do other people feel the same way?

3. I am dreading an attempt to reconcile the series’s present events with events that will happen in the future. (IE: past shows.) Does this show have to create a story that fits with the others like a puzzle piece to be successful? Or can it just focus on storytelling and strong characters and just keep creating an outstanding narrative?

3651,Discovery has trouble giving it's characters flaws in general,"I have to admit that my definition of character flaw might be a little narrow: I wouldn't consider a tragic backstory a character flaw, for example. Emotional baggage might be an obstacle that the character has to overcome, but it isn't a flaw in itself. The way the character chooses to deal with this obstacle may *reveal* a character flaw, however. Refusing to acknowledge their problem, or dealing with it in a destructive manner, or trying to hide it from others would introduce actual flaws to the character that we might even be able to relate to.

That character flaw should be consistent, too. Sure, it can change over time, as the character learns and grows, but it can't show up out of nowhere and then vanish without being resolved properly.

However, I think Discovery has real problems with this. For the most part, the characters only have *quirks*. Yes, Micheal is a smartass, Tilly is anxious and bubbly, Stamets is (used to be?) a curmudgeon, but those traits rarely cause them or their surroundings any trouble or force them to reflect on themselves. Most of the time, the struggles for the characters are caused entirely from external circumstances, that they then have to overcome.

The few times the characters act in questionable ways either aren't set up properly or are undermined by the fact that they are presented as *completely justified*.

* Yes, I guess Michael shouldn't have staged a mutiny to attack the Klingons in the pilot episode, but wasn't she absolutely right in her assessment of the situation? Doesn't that make her sentencing just another external obstacle she has to overcome rather than a justified consequence for her actions?
* Yes, Saru probably &gt;!wasn't acting appropriately for a starfleet officer when they where dealing with the Ba'ul, but wasn't he just reacting in rightful anger to what was, from his point of view, a massive injustice done to his people over generations!&lt;? Also, so far this was only a one time overreaction on his part, which seemingly was resolved within the episode &gt;!by freeing his people!&lt;.
* The newest example would be Captain Pike &gt;!going on a reckless shuttle mission as a way of overcompensating for not participating in the war!&lt;. However, that this weighs so heavily on him is not only dumped on us out of nowhere, but it's seemingly resolved within the same episode by Pike gracefully admitting to this at the end.

Of course, in a Star Trek series the plot will always involve external threats or problems, but they shouldn't replace character development and introspection. This doesn't mean that none of the Discovery episodes are enjoyable or that none of the characters are likeable, but I think it considerable weighs the series down because it robs it's characters of ways to grow and the audience of ways to identify with the characters.",startrek,1551537803,PeeAeMKay,17,0,True,2019-03-02

3653,DangerousDac's Grand Unified Theory of Discovery Season 2 and Picard Season 1.,"THE FOLLOWING IS ALL SPECULATION BASED ON EVENTS SEEN IN SHORT TREKS, DISCOVERY SEASON 2 UP UNTIL 2x06 AND LEAKED DETAILS BASED AROUND PICARD SHOW.

Ok. This is probably all wrong and is not in any way me leaking knowing info, but is merely inferred by me from next weeks trailer, and points hammered home throughout Season 2. 

THE RED ANGEL

I believe the Angel is Future Burnham, attempting to ""stack the deck"" so that Spock does not die. I think Spock is going to die around 2x10 and be a big shock ending that is resolved by the season finale in bringing Spock back. Only when he's brought back he's not crazy, clean shaven and acting more like Spock we know. The key to this is although Future Burnham has been trying to stop Spock's death by changing events that directly lead to it, she does not realise the harsh, harming even she as Kid caused to Spock to stop him being a target for logic extremists is the very act that lead Spock down a path to working with Section 31 and finding out the big evil secret that is burning his brain. Burnham will go back to when Spock is a kid to apologise to him and let him know his sister loves him. This week, the probe that went to the future came back modified and started attacking Pike's shuttle and downloading as much info from its database as it could. Then, in the trailer we see a vision where similar craft wipe out Earth in a huge attack. I think this is...

CONTROL

Now, Control has been mentioned many many times already throughout season 2 as being in ""control"" of Section 31. Assuming it is based on the Control from the novel verse, it is a secret all knowing all powerful AI that is in control of Section 31 and ultimately the entire Federation, dictating events from the shadows. Sometime around the 28th Century, Control will become corrupt/rampant (to borrow a phrase from Halo) and turn against the Federation. Causing the destruction Spock foresaw. This AI then begins expanding it knowledge base, using select humans loyal to it to pursue its cause whilst other humans fight it and them. This is the future Craft is in. The V'draysh is control. It is winning. But the crew of Discovery created a last ditch failsafe to stop it. Zora. She is another AI designed to stop Control, but something happens to the crew of Discovery that prevents them from using it, so it is left hidden for 1000 years. Maybe she is left for that length of time to become ""evolved"" enough to take it on, and Burnham uses the spore time travel red angel tech to go to it and bring it back from the future to ultimately destroy Control, forcing Section 31 to publicly disband but begin to work in the deep shadows. Burnham and Spock discuss their victory, but Spock says what he saw wasn't a future, but an alternate timeline in which control had won. He is thankful it has been stopped in our time, but is fearful of what such an all encompassing AI mind might do...

PICARD

Now, I believe the Picard show is going to be based on the novel Destiny. It was trademarked as a TV show title way back when by CBS but will probably not follow the novel plot exactly. Assuming it is to do with the Destruction of romulus, in that process Nero's Narada was transformed from a mining ship into an enormous spiky warship thanks to Borg tech. Picard will be on the hunt for the facility that created this. Or will be on the hunt for x weird signal that turns out to be related to it. Either way, the Borg will factor into this show (if it is a Destiny novel in any way shape or form the Borg will be a big part of it) somehow and it being Destiny will ultimately deal with the origin of the Borg. This is going to turn out to be...

CONTROL 2.0

We jump back to the universe in which Control has won. As the eons stretch on, it becomes the dominant being in the universe. It consumes and controls everything. But despite its vast nature and all knowing-ness, it cannot stop the universe and by extension itself from dying. It attempts to keep itself alive by sending a small time capsule of itself at the last minute of existence back to the big bang. But in the process as the atoms of its last computer being to spread apart, its data becomes corrupted. The Time capsule is damaged and left adrift for billions of years. Eventually it is discovered by some poor soul and reactivated, but it doesn't know itself. It only knows to consume. And make itself better. Not better - Perfect. Thus, the Borg come into existence. Destiny will ultimately find some way to ""deal"" with the Borg, I don't know what form this is going to take. I don't think it's gonna be Caeliar with the white light of love. I don't *want* to destroy all the Borg either. Some maguffin will have to tie up this bow, but I don't have that part of the puzzle just yet. 

In conclusion, its not perfect, it might not be right at all, but right now I think this is going to be path Discovery Season 2 and Picard Season 1 takes. It should be of note that Michael Chabon who wrote Calypso is one of the main writers on Picard, so V'Draysh/Zora might well factor into both Disco and Picard somehow.

3669,"VOY ""Scientific Method"" is a masterfully done episode","VOY S04E07, just re-watched this one again and it is one of my top favorites in the series. It was just done so well! You have an intriguing story that starts off with an interesting mystery, and their nemesis was played by an actor who was great in the role. You have the Dr. and Seven teaming up together, and the visuals were quite interesting in a macabre kind of way, once you begin to see what the aliens are doing to the crew.

The opening few minutes with Janeway on the massage table had both Kate Mulgrew and Robert Picardo delivering perfect performances.  Kate's facial expressions were so well controlled and perfect for this scene, and I love the way that the show-runners framed that shot, with Picardo constantly going in and out of frame during the conversation. As usual Picardo's comedic instincts and timing were spot-on here.

Story-wise, several things stick out to me every time. I like the way that Tom and B'Elanna's relationship is handled, the interaction between them and their conversation about their relationship and where it's at ""publicly"" seemed very natural and organic. It seemed well done, compared to Chakotay's and Seven's in the last season.

Even though Seven is only a few episodes into the series by this point, the story gives her some nice bits and reveals that as a person, she is growing and cares for the ship and crew, even risking going against Tuvok in order to reveal the presence of the alien. Also her interaction with the Dr. in this episode is the first of many great collaborations to come between the two.

I thought the story did a great job of ratcheting up the tension in Janeway, until the end of the episode sees a crewman's death drive Janeway into a bit of mania, and desperation to escape the alien influence. Again the progression from the beginning of the episode, to her seizing the helm at the end, felt pretty natural and well-paced.

A few random things-  I liked the bit in the Holodeck where the Dr. instructs the computer to materialize a tool for him, and you hear it ""plop"" into the bucket next to him. That was a cool creative choice on the part of the show-runners I thought, as well as the Dr.'s reaction to it happening.

I think it's corny that many times in the show you see characters (in this ep, Tom and B'Elanna in the last few minutes of the ep) wearing casual clothing or pajamas even, with their combadges attached. I don't know why it throws me for a loop when I see it, but it does.

In ""Battle of the Binary Stars,"" T'Kuvma calls Captain Georgiou's greeting of ""We come in peace"" the Federation's ""lie,"" saying that instead the Federation has come to destroy their individuality.

At the time when I was watching that episode, I considered T'Kuvma to just be wrong. Of course it's not a lie—we've been with the Federation for five previous television series and 13 movies at this point. The Federation can definitely be flawed sometimes, but they do come in peace. Starfleet's General Order One is a policy of non-interference, the Federation itself is a cooperative of planets working together, and they are always willing to come to the table and negotiate with their adversaries.

Now, though, going into season 2:

* We've had a season 1 finale in which the Federation has essentially sponsored a coup of the Klingon Empire through the use of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of their chosen leader.

* The Federation and Starfleet officially sanction Section 31, and have recruited the equivalent of space Hitler, Mirror Emperor Georgiou, to serve in its ranks. This is an organization currently meddling in Klingon affairs, conducting black ops and assassinations. Admiral Cornwell calls it a ""critical intelligence division,"" and that ""nation building is never pretty.""

* Despite all this, Starfleet officers are still content to spread the Starfleet Gospel of peace and understanding, and will be doing so in eight years when we catch up to Kirk and crew on the *Enterprise* for their five-year mission.

So, with Starfleet and the Federation saying one thing, but then doing another, would it be fair to say that T'Kuvma was right about the Federation way back in season 1?

And can we really blame the Klingons in Kirk's time when they don't trust the Federation, or the Klingons of *Star Trek VI*, who fear the Federation and the annihilation of their culture and people, with a Federation-sponsored coup only 35 years in the past, and recent rumors of a new Starfleet WMD called the ""Genesis Torpedo""?

Starfleet recently seems to be acting more like the United States when interacting with other interstellar civilizations, except I don't think even the United States would provide, say, Juan Guaidó in Venezuela with nuclear weapons he could use to threaten the country.

3685,Theory about the future of Discovery - and a question about Copyright/Crossovers.,"I have a theory, or more of a concern about where the story of Star Trek Discovery is going.

&amp;#x200B;

In S2E07 of Discovery when the ship is being hacked from the time rift, a weird symbol of three red dots in a triangle with the 'point' facing down. The robot / cyborg lady on Discovery seemed to be infected or influenced by the hacking process. Note that this hacking is likely caused by the tentacle robots from the future.

Now I've seen these traits before elsewhere... Robots from the future with tentacles that extend into a machine to absorb its knowledge and take control. With the central controlling influence bearing a symbol of three red (Or sometimes other colours) circles in a triangle pointing down.

That is EXACTLY what happens in every DC Animated Movie or DCAU or similar story when Brainiac first attacks. They include the three-dots symbol to help you spot the signs that this is Brainiac and it's going to be a big deal even if it seems resolved temporarily.

So I did some googling and Star Trek Discovery is made/owned by CBS and the Arrowverse is made/owned by CW which is/was formed from CBS and Warner Brothers. (For those that don't know, The Arrowverse is Sprawling web of DC action TV shows, similar to the MCU or DCEU but it's not connected to any of the movies like Justice League. I stopped watching after Legends Of Tomorrow crossed over into Supergirl and it got too confusing).

Does this mean CBS has control over both Star Trek AND some sections of DC Comics?

Could the USS Discovery be being hacked by Brainiac?

What does that mean for the identity of the Red Angel? Ray Palmer? Terry McGinnis?",startrek,1551594321,Simon_Drake,16,0,True,2019-03-03
3686,"Newbie to Trek Universe, realized Voyager's starting point is from the Borg-SP8472 war","So i have only recently gotten into Star trek and watch episodes whenever i can. I thoroughly enjoyed TNG , it never felt like it was made more than 25 yrs ago. 

So after finishing TNG , it was between DS9 or Voyager to continue. So from online non spoiler summaries i felt voyager had the more interesting premise. So i started voyager but oof the first and second episode bored me a lot.

And then i got busy and had to take a brief hiatus and forgot about it , till one day i came across a post about the Borg-sp8472 war which threatened to extinct the Borg and that piqued my interest. 

So i found out those events take place in Voyager from the finale of the 3rd season. I don't like jumping into a series in the middle but i was curious what it was about so i watched it and I was hooked!

Yes Voyager still had cheesy episodes but it had many good ones too reminiscent of TNG which is what I was missing. I also felt they showed the desperation of the Voyager crew being lost so far in space from their home while dealing with their day to day problems.

Also I guess by the end Voyager was kind of a legendary vessel to have survived powerful threats through tactics , Diplomacy and sheer will. 

I think the Episode Shattered from the 7th season gave a very good summary of how the crew evolved from the beginning to where they ended up.

The Doctor was indeed a scene stealer , and it made sense why despite being a hologram , his character behaved so brash and arrogant yet likable and unyielding about his morality ( except for that one time).

And I am surprised it took me so long to realize Capt Janeway was indeed Kate Mulgrew whose performances i have enjoyed in many other roles prior to watching this. 

I did watch episodes from the 1st 3 seasons but most were miss rather than hit. I guess something changed in the production side that caused them to make better stories 4th season onwards.

Anyway that was my 2 cents on the topic. Any suggestions on if DS9 has some sort of a similar take off point i should start from?",startrek,1551595006,prankored,6,5,True,2019-03-03

3688,The Neelixification of Tilly,"I am a little worried about the character of Tilly...

What started out as a fairly realistic portrayal of a young cadet with believable idiosyncrasies and personality quirks, week by week appears to be descending into borderline buffoonery. 

For some reason, Silvia Tilly is the only officer aboard Discovery that feels she does not need to comport herself the same as other Starfleet officers, frequently speaking out of turn and cursing with reckless abandon. What the frick is up with that?

There are some parallels forming with Voyager's Neelix, where although not a comic relief character per se, his incessant joviality could become grating at times. It was only in episodes such as 'Jetrel' and 'Mortal Coil' that we got to experience a darker Neelix, two occasions I felt massively added depth to an otherwise one-dimensional character.

However unlike Neelix, Tilly has the potential to be an extremely interesting character, a scientific genius with a dream to become a Captain, learning to overcome her various issues to succeed. I'd like to see more depth and conflict, perhaps dealing with the issues caused by her perfectionist mother.

Right now we have a character that is high on caffeine, talks too fast, and seems to have a wise crack for the sake of the audience and imho, it would be a shame to have a clearly talented actress and interesting character become an irritant for the sake of a few cheap laughs...

So, when Starfleet for example encounters a planet without warp drive signatures, does that mean the planet's population is a pre-warp civilization? What if the planet isn't using warp drive as their faster-than-light drive, what if they are using a Star Wars style hyperdrive for example?

3709,"An idea for a Star Trek story.. that doesn't involve the Enterprise, Picard, Kirk, or... well pretty much anything we've actually dealt with before.","So I'm involved with a creative writing group and I wanted to push myself a bit creatively. To that end I've been thinking about Star Trek Stories and what could I come up with. I came up with the typical fan-fic stuff: Stories of a renewed war with the Dominion, Meeting Niel Armstrong, Saving the galaxy, etc. But in all of those case I felt like I was really flailing and just 'Because it'd be awsome'-ing too much. So I came up with some guide lines to help focus myself:  


1- It could not involve any major characters we have already seen in canon  
2- It could not influence anything we've seen on screen to date.  
3- it had to involve time travel  
4- It needed to actually explore something like a theme or a concept.  


So the first 2 points are easy enough to address. Different ship, different crew in a different era. Time Travel presented some challenges because 9 out of 10 times I hate Trek's Time travel stories. Too often the time travel is just an excuse to have Trek in our back yard or similar. I really wanted the Time Travel to be... 'more permanent and awe inspiring' and less 'replace your divet' kind of event. Like, Guys you just traveled in bleeping time! Yeah it's great that you're educated and can appreciate the spectacle of it... but you just traveled in time! This should be a total ""Oh.... shit!"" kind of thing. So I hit on the idea of making the Time Travel one way. From there I came up with an idea that is a bit of a play on the idea of ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" and how things can change history. 

In Pre-TNG times, the Federation is watching a planet because they seem to be on the verge of developing warp travel and they want to make first contact. But their development comes to a complete halt. Like there is no accident, or war or anything. Some minor border clashes and some natural events, but nothing that actually explains why they literally stopped progressing toward Warp Drive technology. They were basically progressing toward it one month, and then the next month they stopped. So The Federation backs off but keeps watching.

Fast Forward about 50 years (so we're post Romulus being destroyed), and suddenly this race has not only achieved warp speed, but actually contacted the Federation, like pro-actively. They didn't bump into the Federation, they walked up and rang the doorbell. 

Needless to say, this is a huge ""WTF?!"" situation. How did they go from advancing toward Warp Drive to stopping advancing toward warp drive, to achieving warp drive without some sort of readily visible cultural change? How do they know about the Federation? 

 Well it turns out that about 10 years later, a Federation ship is thrown back in time (more than 5,000 years) and crashed on the planet. The survivors found themselves in the middle of  the tribal wars of the period. Because of the wars they were faced with a very demanding and complex choice. 

1- Allow themselves to be wiped out in an effort to not influence future history.

\-The problem here is the remains of their ships and its technology would still exist. How big of an 'oops' would it be if a bunch of Bronze age farmers start trying to dismantle a damaged matter/anti-matter reactor?

2- Ally with the seemingly more powerful, and more militaristic tribes.

\-How far would the alliance go? The crew needs to dismantle and destroy the remains of their ship in such a way that the locals won't accidentally set off a quantum torpedo or something. That will take time. Will their allies allow it? 

3- Attempt to repeal the attacking tribes and by de-facto ally with the defending tribes.

\-How capable will the alliance be? The problem of dismantling the ship still remains and while it's possible the defending tribes will be more likely to allow the crew to accomplish this task, will they have the resources to hold back the attacking tribes? 

Ultimately the crew splits on the choice. Some of the crew opting to ally with the attacking tribes in the belief that they can influence them and direct them along more agreeable lines with time and be able to cultivate the resources that would allow them to both survive and dismantle the ship.

The remaining crew ally with the defending tribes largely because the attacking tribes force them into it. They need resources, the attacking tribes won't give them time to acquire said resources.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the 4th point I gave myself would become apparent: 

explore something like a theme or a concept.

In this case the story would explore the Prime Directive, both temporal and none temporal and how it is interpreted and applied in practice. The ship is damaged beyond the crews ability to repair, so they can not leave the planet. They are smack in the middle of a major event in the planets history and while they themselves could move to avoid interfering with it, the ship can not be moved thus they must stay to defend the location/deter the locals from picking around it until they can safely destroy the ship. 

The actual story would first be about the struggle to survive and the ideological divide in the crew between trying to integrate with them, and building an empire among them.

The critical point to remember is that while they would initially start out with the likes of Phasers and computers and Tricorders (these items having survived the crash of the ship), they would not be able to maintain the tools and materials to maintain these items and would need to resort to more primitive items, though with knowledge of more advanced systems and concepts. While the locals are roughly at a pre-bronze era of development, the Star Fleet personal would have general knowledge of Metallurgy, farming, Organization, Government and sanitation all of which would be huge improvements over the local mind-sets.

  
Ultimately one of the groups from the ship and their allies win in the war and history marches onward having been influenced by the results of the war. The Dedication Plaque of the ship is preserved and retained being handed down through the ages from leader to leader until 'modern times'.  As a result of this influence by the Star Fleet crew members, there came a societal law that they could not develop warp travel before a certain date. When it was found that they were advancing faster than that, they would enact a stoppage to delay the development until the time they had originally developed Warp Travel and made first contact with the Federation. 

Following first contact, the dedication Plaque of the ship is presented to star fleet as a 'proof of event' item. The records talking about this event would be sealed for 11 years (to allow the deployment and staffing of the ship in question to occur unmodified). Perhaps unsealing the records could form the framing device for the story. A Star Fleet admiral is charged with addressing these newly unsealed records and he begins reading the reports from the captain who made first contact with the planet, only to discover that the real first contact had been made 5000 years prior.

3711,"I have to give Discovery credit this season, as someone who actually hated all of the fan service and nostalgia elements they were going to include this season I have to say now I'm truly loving it!","Spoilers if you didn't see the last episode yet!

There was a lot about season 2 I was geniuenely excited for: Red angel/red burst story line; Section 31 (yes I had no problems with them appearing); a show about exploration and science again and trying to fit into prime timeline more like giving the Klingons back their hair and etc. 

But I actually wasn't looking forward to the stuff that was really making all the news like Pike showing up and basically taking over the show along with Spock having such a dominant story line. And for me, finding out why he smiled in a 50 year old unaired pilot was about as intriguing to me as wanting to know why Wesley wore the exact same clothes every day on TNG. Just.don't.give.a.shit! And then when I heard we were going back to Talos IV my eyes actually rolled harder. Not because I had anything against Talos IV or that story line and I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious what they would do. But it just felt like so much pandering to get TOS fans on this shows side. They were trying SO hard to connect to that era and basically become a back door sub plot from the Cage it felt more like desperation than a need to tell an interesting story.

But after the first seven episodes and how beautifully they set things up in the last one I have to say I feel the opposite now. Pike is obviously great, which I never doubted I just didn't want him to dominate the show. Now I can't imagine it without him. I'm loving how they are tying in old canon with new. The way they have weaved in Pike, Spock, the red Angel, Section 31 and now Talos IV is pretty genius. The story so far is convoluted but doesn't feel that way. And now I WANT to know why Talos IV is so important for Spock. And I liked that they made Spock more flawed. He was never perfect but he always came off that he was on top of everything. This is the first time  he really does come off vulnerable and you're invested. I think the jury is till out on Peck and how his Spock will measure up but it was a great introduction to see Spock in a very different light from the onset.

So I'm very intrigued in everything they set up and it feels much more organic than I thought. Its still not perfect of course, some of it feel a little shoehorned but very little compared to how I imagined it in my head. Its been a fun ride and a lot of because of how they play on the nostalgia and not hit you over the head with it. ",startrek,1551649849,Trekfan74,10,11,True,2019-03-03

3717,Unpopular opinion: Discovery in season 2 is a really interesting portrayal of a post-scarcity organizational culture,"I get the impression that a lot of people in this sub dislike Tilly's excitability, Pike's loosey-goosey command style, Stamets' weirdness, etc. etc. I would argue that the goofiness of this season is actually a really interesting look at what a bureaucratic, quasi-naval organization might look like in a post-scarcity world.

In our world, people conform to organization and submit to authority because we often don't have a choice. You do what your boss says and keep your head down, or you get fired and starve. Your boss can treat you like a machine cog or a disposable underling because they know they have a certain amount of coercive power over you. We put up with bureaucratic nonsense in higher education and business and politics because those are the only avenues to pursue a secure, fulfilling, intellectually stimulating lifestyle. 

What if we lived in a world without scarcity, money, or material need for conformity? How might we behave if every action and choice we made were entirely voluntary?

I think that's what Discovery (especially this season) is portraying. The characters don't act like military service members or professional academics because they don't need to be. Pike tolerates (even enjoys) a certain amount of silliness because the Federation's post-scarcity, voluntary culture requires it. 

Starfleet personnel constantly deal with psuedoscientific insanity on a regular basis, every week they're getting infested with alien parasites or sucked into a time warp or wrestling with their transporter doppelgangers, and they're doing it because they're a bunch of geeky neurotic weirdos who would be bored with any other lifestyle. But if you tried to force them into an authoritarian ""don't speak unless spoken to"" hierarchy, there's nothing stopping them from quitting immediately and moving to Risa to become an orgy farmer.

Trek has always tried to have its cake and eat it too, waving away behavior that would get someone in our world fired or court martialed, while also portraying almost every Starfleet officer as perfectly adjusted super professionals with little or no personality.

It pisses all over developed lore already mad within in the show for example point to point beaming within a starship during the TOS where it was documented as never done before or for the fact they added full body holographic video calls when they were first trying it out in DS9 if I am recalling correctly. Also Discovery and its massive f***ing SJW PC culture bull**** just like they are doing with Doctor Who. The people are saying Star Trek need to be more inclusive can f*** right off just look at the TOS when it was made it was very inclusive as it had a black woman and Asian man a Russian and an alien that was not native to Earth.

Also the whole mutiny thing it is established in TOS that there is has never been a recorded munity in Starfleet history unless Starfleet just shoved that under the rug which I highly doubt as in the TOS they were still just starting out. In my own head this Discovery show isn't canon and isn't in the prime timeline and if by some miracle that I get enough money to buy the Star Trek license I am going to take discovery out of canon.

There are spoilers.","Having watched it again last night while booking with my tablet in the galley kitchen (can't see the tv from my tiny apartment kitchen) I couldn't help but hate this episode because none of it made sense.

Picard is supposed to be a trained or otherwise competent actor who coaches Data in playing Shakespear characters, yet when he's playing ""Galen"", it's just him talking abruptly and loudly like he's on a stage. I would never hear someone talk like that and assume they're a real person.

Secondly, why would a useless weapon be separated into several different parts and scattered around the quadrant of the galaxy?

Thirdly, the useless weapon (not the part about it not killing if the person has no aggressive thoughts). It takes forever to fire, kills/hurts one person at a time, is too big to conceal. That delusional vulcan and her cohorts spent all that time and money chasing something that is no better than a big honking stick. Somehow that would allow them to takeover the Vulcan gov't and split from the Federation..

From that point to beating Kor probably shouldn't be more than a month or two. Then the time they spend in the mirror university... a week? Two tops. Dealing with the Klingons after they were back couldn't take more than a few weeks either. In fact it was probably more like just a few days. There was be an indefinite amount of time they spend on Earth after the war. Though there really shouldn't be any reason they needed more than a month. Afterwards it has been this non-stop red angel business. 

So it really has only been three to six months for Burnham to be with this crew. If so that seems to be a fairly short time for a lot of character development.

3726,Reconciling the Mycelial network,"We often see a lot of flack from fans regarding the Spore Drive and it's instantaneous travel, and how it could possibly fit into the technology and universe of Star Trek. We know from some close to production that Bryan Fuller's original mushroom idea was for it to be a teraforming technology, with the Federation using it to colonise new planets, which the klingons take as hostile, causing the war from the first season.  The original take had no magic travel, it was just something ordinary that Berg and Harberts took and twisted to make their mark on Star Trek (same with the Tardigrade, who was originally a crew member, not a monster of the week), Perhaps not really knowing what would be plausible in universe.

&amp;#x200B;

**But can the seemingly magic mushrooms fit properly into the universe we love?** I think given the events of the second season so far, that yes it can. Especially when you compare it to other phenomenon from past trek adventures.  

[Mycelial Network](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Mycelial_network) as we see in Saints of Imperfection is a subspace domain inhabited by life forms both Sentient and not (JahSepp and Yeel Tree, probably our legally questionable Tardigrade friend too). We have seen inhabited subspace domains before, take for instance the aliens who are experimenting on the crew in [TNG's Schisms](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Schisms_(episode)) or [The Void](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Void_(anomaly)) from Voyager. Subspace has an infinite number of domains. Geordi La Forge compared it with ""*... a huge honeycomb with an infinite number of cells.*"" Story wise subspace continues to be a macguffin for anything, its infinite.

&amp;#x200B;

Using subspace for transport is also not unseen in Star Trek previously. On Enterpise the Xindi use s[ubspace vortices / corridors](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Subspace_vortex) and the Borg's [Transwarp Conduits](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Transwarp_conduit) also utilise entering a path in subspace to shortcut all over the milkyway. Memory Alpha calls the [Bajoran Wormhole](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bajoran_wormhole) a subspace shortcut. It travels about 50,000 light years in a matter of moments. Its possible that Quantum Slipstream is a corridor in subspace, but its unclear even in book canon.

&amp;#x200B;

**But why isn't it in use by the Federation in other eras?** Clearly 2 factors have influenced the Federation when it comes to this technology. firstly there is a delicate ecosystem in this subspace domain, that travel through is disrupting. Starfleet later find out that [Warp travel is destroying subspace](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Force_of_Nature_(episode)) they modify the fleet's engines to lessen the impact, see Voyager's Variable geometry Warp Nacelles, later classes like the Soverign had changes to fix their impact (yes it was solved off screen). Secondly, Staments himself is a violation of Eugenics laws in the Federation, it is possible that a computerised interface is never found, even if they are not worried about killing life forms in the network, but maybe someone who doesn't care quite so much might still be using the technology (*this part is my conjecture*). We know at some point **Section 31** must go back underground (being scrubed from the record and stop flying ships), we also know that agents like Sloan can appear on DS9 (a ""frontier"" of the Federation) at the speed of plot when needed, and possibly without a ship in tow. The reaction cube on Discovery was able to transport Michael many light years without a biological interface, if 31 are doing the same thing, they no longer need to maintain a fleet of ships.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3737,Star Trek: Discovery and the case of the problematic colour palette.,"So, I just want to preface this discussion by saying I don't hate Discovery. In fact, it's grown on me, and I think there's a *huge* amount of potential there, and I hope it pushes more and more into that potential as time goes on. But at the same time, things shouldn't remain immune to critique. So onwards!

So one of the oft undiscussed design choices ongoing with Discovery is the colour palette. I'm hesitant to call it a problem, because while on one hand I think it's bad, it's so prevalent that it's clearly a conscious decision and I'm eager to see if anyone else has a similar view.

So what am I banging on about? 

**Star Trek Discovery has an obsession with the colour blue, and to a lesser extent red/orange/yellow as a contrast.**

So what do I mean by that? I urge you to watch an episode of Discovery, and in every scene, roughly work out how much of the scree is devoted to the colour blue. It's probably upwards of 75%. Then, you will always see a singular form of contrast, and that's normally a yellow, orange or red. It's so noticeable that I now can't un-notice it.

So what's the problem? For those who play lots of hobbies, you might be aware that blue/orange is used often to draw your eyes to something like the cover of a video game box. In a long running TV show, you shouldn't stick to this principle. It becomes saturated with a single colour. 

Let me go through some examples, especially examples where I'm wrong to prove my point. Let's start with [Kaminar, Saru's Homeworld.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/7/78/Kaminar_beach.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190223003842&amp;path-prefix=en) I thought, considering how vibrant Saru's quarters are, this planet would be lush in bright fauna and green wildlife. But look at that screenshot. The sand is red, the water is blue and the fauna has a blue tint given to it. Even a lush tropical world is blue and red, somehow. 

What about the ship interiors? [The panels are almost always blue. The lights are blue. The uniforms are blue \(And the trim is usually a burned golden orange\)](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/startrek-dsc-upfrontrail-17.jpg) and even when they are near a sun, the light filtering through the windows provides an ambient orange glow.

But not everything is blue. Sometimes they use such a brash contrast that it becomes highly noticeable, but even then it's done lazily in my view. Like a colour equals allegiance. What do I mean? Well, [everything](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--NI-mfuW_--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/ggllafevyh3pbmzhapjx.png) [the](https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/10/09/lrell-star-trek-discovery-season-2.JPG) [Klingon's](https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/2017/07/Star-Trek-Discovery-Klingons_.png) [do](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*LRZpa03E24t1UlN4.jpg) seems to be red/orange.

One complaint is that parts like Jeffery's tubes or plasma conduits would not line up between the different sections, but this seems to assume that the parts fit together like legos, while in modern engineering fule and control systems are often sent through pipes that can be extended, diverted, or rerouted to fit parts together, for instance, the fuel line to an engine could be extended with a hose to fit a new engine into an old car.

I also think that we see a lot of examples of Frankenstein fleet type designs in the real world. Production lines don't always get taken down at the same time, and when trying to feel an emergency roll old lines are often reactivated so that parts can be available as soon as possible.

The Sherman tank from WWII used the main body of an earlier model of tank, and if I remember right, it's gun was chosen because there was a surplus of those guns from the navy (I do know that other tanks and artillery did use navy guns.) The single shot rolling block rifle was used even into WW1 because there was a manufacturing line for it, which allowed them to move other rifles to the front while local guards received the ""new"" rolling blocks designed to use what was then modern ammo. In WW2 some T3 tankers were converted into aircraft carriers.

What do people here think of the Frankenstein Fleet, are there any real-world examples of similar things, (and can anyone point me to some good information about the Frankenstein Fleet?)",startrek,1551726327,TheNameOf7,3,3,True,2019-03-04

3753,Riker and the captain's chair,"One of the perplexing things about Riker was his apparent lack of of ambition/desire to have his own captaincy. We see him as a very capable and vastly experienced leader serving for many years as first officer aboard the flagship. In that time Starfleet suffers massive casualties from the battle of Wolf 359 to the Dominion War so needless to say good experienced captains are hard to find. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why has Riker never taken a command of his own? You would have to expect that at some point the powers that be, faced with rebuilding the fleet would have felt the urge to order Riker to command one of those ships. I can't imagine at times of war or during major crises they would have been too bothered by some concept of keeping the whole assignment thing voluntary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Certainly the most obvious timing would have been following the Borg invasion but considering Picard was recovering from his own assimilation you can forgive them for wanting to keep Riker on the Enterprise, just in case Jean Luc decides life was better in the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to come up with a number of theories: 

\- Riker likes the First Officer life too much, can work his way through the females of the Galaxy without too much blowback.

\- Picard has too much power in Starfleet and ensures none of the really tempting assignments go Rikers way.

\- Riker was smitten with Troy from the beginning and refused any promotions that would separate the two of them.

\- Riker was not interested in commanding a lesser ship to the Enterprise and Picard simply wouldn't get out of his way.

\- No way was Riker going to leave the Enterprise until he finished off his Captain Archer holodeck binge.

&amp;#x200B;

Those can all be thrown aside since ""The Pegasus"" (S7 Ep12) basically nails the coffin lid shut on why Riker never took his own command. 

You have to assume the real movers and shakers in Starfleet command were aware of Rikers original involvement defending Pressman from the mutineers. They did not trust him and deemed it too risky or embarrassing to have Riker promoted into the limelight as it might expose the whole affair. So they throw him the occasional bad captaincy option safe in the knowledge that he will turn them down. Perhaps Pressman himself, who certainly appears to have quite a bit of influence in Starfleet (particularly Starfleet intelligence) fears Riker getting promoted to the level of captain might provide him the opportunity to confront the admiral and his naughty past. We also know that following the rediscovery of the Pegasus and the arrest of Pressman, Riker's record would have been badly tarnished essentially cementing his place on the blacklist for those who should never be offered any meaningful captaincy. I suppose by the time the Titan came along, Rikers haters in Starfleet Command had either retired or died or perhaps he saved the Federation one time too many that continuing to overlook him was more hassle than it was worth.

3770,Opinion: Picard Series and the Geopolitics of the Trekverse,"One of the things I believe Star Trek has done best of all, ever since TOS, is hold up a mirror. In other words, its allowed us to reflect on the times we live in by using allegory as a device to invite political and social commentary.  Despite Roddenberry's utopian optimism, the TOS was very much a show rooted in the Cold War and the turmoil of the 1960s, and did not shy away from addressing those issues. Not that TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT did not continue the tradition in their own way, but I really hope the Picard show truly embraces the sort of sociopolitical commentary TOS was known for. With a sure hit like Steward headlining, I think they could really go for thinking-persons Sci-Fi and not fear that audiences will run away. I could only imagine the storytelling possibilities that could come out of exploring a more complex, full fleshed out Trekverse - and using that complexity to thoughtfully explore the current challenges of our world.

&amp;#x200B;

So what's this about the geopolitics of the Trekverse? It has to do with the rumor of the show  using the Hobus nova as a springboard and what to make of the state of the Trekverse 20 years after that event if we were to tailor it as closely as possible to our current world. The problem is that ever since TOS, the aggressive yet reclusive Romulans have sometimes been the Soviets, sometimes been the Red Chinese, and it was never clear. I guess we could say China, especially if we compare the explosion of Praxis with the Chernobyl disaster that eventually led to the collapse of the USSR (aka Klingon Empire) except that it didn't and TNG threw all of this in the trash. So, let's start again, or at least what I hope to see in the Picard series.

&amp;#x200B;

The Klingons should definitely once and for all be established as an allegory for China, feudal China, as if imperial China never ceased to exist. Isolationist and hostile towards the west (UFP), especially western encroachment. There was a cautiously pro-west opening at one time time (like with Deng Xiaoping and the TNG era) but by the Picard show, the Klingons (like China today) are a resurgent superpower, reinforcing their borders (South China Seas), expanding their armada, and openly competing with the UFP. Namely model UFP-Klingon relations after US/Euro-PRC relations today. Internally I would like to see further exploration of the 24 houses and the fiefs they rule over. I'd like to know about the non-Klingon subjects and vassals of the empire and how they are ruled over. Do the Klingons practice direct or indirect rule? Do they ignore or exploit religion? Do they leave pre-warp societies alone? What tensions exists between the houses, not to mention between the castes? 

&amp;#x200B;

The Romulans are now the Russians, let's just settle it now. Not a perfect fit but for the show's premise to work we have to say they are the Russians around 1990s - 2000s. The loss of Romulus was like the fall of the Soviet Union. Chunks of the former empire broke away (Eastern Europe) and drifted toward the UFP/Vulcans. Other chunks struck out on their own and the empire's successor state has been fighting a never ending series of secessionist uprisings (Chechnya and Georgia 1990s). Just before the Picard show, stability had been returning and the Romulan successor state was regaining it's footing under the dictatorship of a Putin like figure whose long term plan it to restore his beloved, fallen empire to its former glory. Given that the Romulans were also clumsily modeled after Rome, being ruled by a dictator would make perfect sense. By the time of the Picard show, former chunks of the Romulan empire (not absorbed by the UFP or claimed by the Romulan successor state) have fallen into internal fighting and civil war (Yugoslav Wars 1990s) igniting another refugee crisis. To make matters worse, the successor state actually launched an offensive into a chunk of it's former empire, causing a Ukraine-like situation, and igniting yet another refugee crisis. It was never an easy task absorbing all of the Romulans that suddenly fled into UFP space, and now with the refugee crisis, the old xenophobic feelings are returning, with some even questioning the viability of the UFP's future itself. Just model the UFP-Romulan relationship after the US/Euro-Russian relationship around 2014. Just like the Klingons, I would like the show to explore the complex diversity of the Romulan empire and how they govern over the many people's within their borders. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Cardassians are perhaps the most interesting of all.  I always saw the Cardassian Union as an allegory for a Pan-Arab/Baathist Middle East - modern, secular, repressive, and very authoritarian/fascist. It was Hussein, Bashar, Mubarak, Nasser all rolled into one, and of course everyone knows Bajor is Israel. By the time of the Picard show, what was once the Cardassian Union, because of the devastation of the Dominion War, is a shattered shell of it's former self. The successor state failed and collapsed as so did every attempt afterwards. Now it's just a region of space embroiled in turmoil, desperation, and violence (like a Syria or Somalia). In the last 20 years a popular death cult has emerged that has it's roots in ancient Cardassian religion, a death cult that has incited zealous fanaticism and a surge of violence acts of terror aimed at not only at non-Cardassians but also at Cardassians tied with the former establishment. The cult, centered around an ancient Cardassian death deity, preaches the return of Cardassia's former glory and her destined dominion of the quadrant through fire and bloodshed. Okay. this cult would represent an Al-Qaeda/Isis/Wahhabi/Jihadi antagonist. So much to do storytelling wise here as well as exploring issues of blowback and the folly of interventionism.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, let the show lose it's rose colored classes when it comes to the UFP. Actually [https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/awqi46/so\_was\_tkuvma\_ultimately\_right\_about\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/awqi46/so_was_tkuvma_ultimately_right_about_the/) got me thinking about all of this. Consider Tukuvma's argument. Maybe the Federation is no better than the Borg. It's the Borg with a smile. Instead of coming to forcibly assimilate, the Federation comes to co-opt and appropriate all the same. Promises of mutual aid, mutual benefit, and mutual defense become eventual absorption and loss of one's uniqueness, one's autonomy, all in the end to maintain the power and privilege of the UFP's dominant societies (Earth, Vulcan, Andorra, maybe Tellar). The UFP is expansionist, it meddles in the affairs of other societies despite the prime directive, it sponsors coups, etc. and even withing the UFP there is discontent. Only the blind can't see that it's a human dominated organization. The Picard show should not avoid these issues. I could even see some worlds wanting to leave the UFP. Would the UFP even accept the exit of a world deep in Federation space? I think for the show they should set up the Vulcans wanting to leave (Vulcxit) and wanting to form a new union with remnants of the former Romulan Empire. How will Federation politics navigate this crisis? Hell, I would love to see a more complex exploration of Federation governance and politics not to mention Vulcan, Andorrian, and Tellarite society.  

&amp;#x200B;

That still leaves to show with figuring out how the Breen, Orions, Suliban, etc. play out in this geo-political landscape.

3777,I feel like Discovery 'The Sounds of Thunder' was a great (missed) example in favor of the Prime Directive,"So you have a species that at first glance are the victims of a cruel predatory race. Our heroes obviously have sympathy for them, show up and find out that not only were the victims actually the original bad guys that almost pushed the 2nd species toward extinction, but that their victims managed to fight back and actually gain the upper hand. But then, rather than completely exterminating them, settled on a problematic but also arguably elegant solution from their point of view. 

They created a regime that allowed their former tormentors to continue living while preventing them from developing physical traits that manifested their aggressive natures. And given the fact that as soon as Saru dropped his threat worms he turned into kind of an asshole, squaring up against Pike, blatantly disregarding orders and basically doing a complete reversal on his personality, it's not beyond possibility that his race revert to their previous ways and wipe out their now weakened adversaries. 

I feel like if it were a TNG episode they would have deep dived into all that. How the Federation can show up thinking they are saving one species by doing the right thing and in the process, through their own ignorance and despite their good intentions end up condemning another one and permanently altering the development of a planet.  Instead literally everyone involved is like yeah fuck the prime directive and then all high five themselves afterword with just a handwave and assumption that everyone will totally learn to work together now. 

Obviously the Prime Directive and whether it is the right or wrong policy to take gets brought up a lot, but I think what happened in this episode was a great argument in favor of it, even if I still do have some problems with the implications of following it 100%. Disappointing that it was never really addressed during the episode aside from one throwaway line about not completely ignoring general order 1 while then proceeding to not only ignore but back a truck over it a few times to make sure it was dead.

3789,An issue I have with DSC's foray into the Mirror Universe and its ties to older Trek canon.,"Okay, I'm going to break this down: the crew of the *Discovery* knows that the Terran Empire's rise to power came from their acquisition of the *Constitution*-class *USS Defiant*, and they know some of the circumstances that brought that ship to the mirror universe. They, along with Mirror Georgiou, would have provided enough knowledge in their debriefs to sketch out a rough outline of what happened to the *Defiant*.

Now, my question is this: why did Starfleet decide to sacrifice the lives of the 400 men and women of the *USS Defiant* to the madness of interphase in order to preserve the history of another universe by giving a fully-loaded *Constitution*-class starship to a sadistically militaristic version of 22nd century Starfleet so that they can wreak greater havoc on the galaxy? I know Trek is all about the needs of the many over the few or the one, but given the circumstances I think this particular ""many"" can go to hell.

**EPISODE NOTES**

*That shot entering the Bridge from outside was cool for television in 1965. I can kinda see how it has expanded  into the outside-in-shots from *Star Trek* (2009) onwards. 
* I forgot how grey the Enterprise’s bridge was. For a 60s show, it’s *very* grey. 
* Speaking of 1960s expectations; Pike lives up to those standards with standout lines like, *“I just can’t get used to a woman on the bridge.”*
* Spock is *very* shouty
* Hey, look! Pike’s using a communicator in his quarters to call someone!
* [Donnelly Rhodes](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722413/) would have been excellent recasting for Dr. Boyce today. Sadly, he passed away last year. 
* Man, Pike is super-grumpy. 
* Spock is *VERY* shouty
* There’s a Lt. Tyler onboard!
* I wonder if that manbearpig creature in the other cage will reappear. 
* Also, what about Vina?! I wonder if she does appear what changes to make up they’ll make. 
* “We’re in a menagerie! A cage!” [Aha! He said it!](https://media1.tenor.com/images/87b91ff3018d23a3208d4ec30abf1657/tenor.gif?itemid=5286270)
* *“THE WOMEN!”*
* Okay, there’s no way the “They can’t read your mind if you are full of hate” schtick is going to be kept in an update?!
* I wonder if we’ll see the ruins from where Number 1 tried to blow a hole into the Talosian compound. 
* Wait a minute. First, the Talosians are peeved that they can’t use Pike to procreate with Vina, but now they’re like, “Hey, naw. Were cool. Also, we’ll look after Vina. Well, at least until our species dies out, because we’re doomed now. Don’t ask us why, or what we are going to do now to save ourselves. 

**REVIEW**

Honestly, this feels rough compared to the rest of Trek, but we cannot forget that this is where it all began. The dynamics of the show changed and evolved over time, and while the initial ideas were there, they still needed fleshing out a little more. We even see this in *Where No Man Has Gone Before*.

I want to keep to the basic premise overall, rather than critique every little part of it, as judging *The Cage* by today’s TV feels extremely redundant. 

Overall I found the episode to be fine, although after an hour it still feels like it ends abruptly. 

Pike didn’t learn anything about himself — the question posed at the beginning of the episode, *whether Pike wants to continue as the captain of the Enterprise or leave Starfleet entirely*, remains unanswered. 

I’d have liked to have known more about the Talosians and why it is their species is dying rather than the 2 dimensional villains keeping our protagonist prisoner that we got. 

In fact, for just under 60 minutes, it felt like the episode very much spun its wheels. 

There was the B story of Spock and Number 1 trying to save the captain, but that goes nowhere. And the A plot is a series of incidents that only happen to Pike. Sure, we see him trying to figure stuff out, and we get some backstory about who he is, but that’s all. It’s only through Talosian ineptitude that Pike gets the opportunity to escape, not his cunning or ingenuity , or even the Enterprise crew themselves coming up with a solution. 

It’s not even resolved by a diplomatic solution, it just ends with an “oh, yeah. Judging by the history we’ve downloaded from your computers there’s no way we can enslave you. Alright, you can go.” And even the turn with Vina feels unnecessary. It’s like a chunk was cut out of Vina and the Talosians reconciling. They quickly change from malevolence towards Vina to benevolence. It’s just such a weird turn in the story. 

With Discovery returning to Talos IV I’m interested to see how much time we will actually spend there. 

I took a look at Memory Alpha in case I missed something that was mentioned in the episode, and apparently there is some history there for the Talosians: 

*a technologically advanced species that survived nuclear holocaust by moving underground and generating illusions to pass the time.*

I think this was delivered in exposition by Vina... 

Which is my problem with this episode; the heavy exposition. We’re *told* Pike just lost a bunch of crew to an incident prior to this and that his yeoman was amongst the casualties. We’re *told* 3rd hand everything we know about the Talosians, when it would have been nice to be shown in an illusion their plight. Their powers could have been used more creatively to *show* the audience things that have happened to Pike and the Enterprise. 

But I guess this was largely hindered by a TV budget and special effects of the era. 

Which is not something *Discovery* suffers too much from. 

I think this is why we’re going back to Talos IV, and to use their abilities to push the Red Angel arc forward, get more backstory on the Burnham/Spock relationship, and hopefully along the way some worldbuilding of the Talosians.

3809,Pleasantly surprised/impressed by Voyager.,"So I'm a huge TNG fan. I grew up watching TNG on TV though I was a little young to catch them coming out weekly. I mostly caught reruns, but searched for and watched them enthusiastically. I watched DS9 as it came out as much as i could and loved it as well. So when they announced a new Star Trek show called Voyager, I got really excited. However, I was relatively disappointed when it first came out, lost interested quickly and only caught bits and pieces of it until i moved away from home and my TV watching habits disintegrated almost entirely. 

Then there came you lot. Talking about star trek day in and day out. I could rave about how much better TNG and DS9 are than Voyager to people who would understand. I'm not sure exactly what problem I had with Voyager. Maybe the child in my just liked the bigger/better Galaxy Class Enterprise and couldn't bring myself to like that ""silly little ship"" Voyager. Maybe by the time I started Voyager, I was old enough to be beyond that golden age of youth that everything seems so important to, but young enough that I didn't understand that nostalgia can create expectations that will taint your perception of many good things you encounter that you would otherwise like had they not conflict with a memory involved in that period. Maybe my younger self felt that liking Voyager would betray the special place in my heart that TNG had. DS9 wasn't a ""starship"" star trek so I could subconsciously justify liking it along with TNG (not to mention Worf, my favourite character as a child). 

But here I am today. An adult. Capable of separating childhood discrimination and taking an unbiased attempt at watched through Voyager. I'm happy to say that I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed at the depth of character development and the subtlety in the performances of the all the actors. Especially Janeway. I just watched ""Meld"" in season 2 and was riveted. It's my favourite episode by far. I'm really really happy that Voyager hasn't been the disappointment I was expecting.

3816,The Dark Side of O'Brien Staring Us in the Face.,"Another post reminded me of that time he spent 20 years in prison, doing hard time, in his mind, and the comment was how all these things seem to be forgotten about by the next episode.

But is it really? 

Nah they fixed it by the end of the episode. It's all good.

All the O'Brien Must Suffer scenarios work themselves out in the end after all. It's just all an inside joke for the creators of the show. Or is it? 

He has a Coffee, black, double sweet while on duty to keep his mind focused on his job so he doesn't have to think about his trauma, and while off duty he drinks his ale at Quark's to forget his trauma.

When that isn't enough, he jumps to the holodeck/holo suite to act out various battles and combat situations. When he comes out, he's happy and had fun.

Let's not forget about his favourite Kayaking program. Getting away from space. Getting away from people and all he knows and just going down the river, just him, the kayak and the water......

...... Until the flashbacks and PTSD kicks in where he starts to relive the horrors he has experienced, loses focus on what he's doing and then the next thing you know, he's in sickbay getting his dislocated shoulder fixed. Happens all the time. But he keeps going back to that program because it's the most peace he ever has is during that moment on the river, until his brain wants him to face his issues and floods him with all the trauma. But it's a risk he's willing to take for the moments it doesn't.

When he's not allowed to kayak to let himself heal, he's back to the ale..... Or he'll play darts.

Anything other than sit around the home with nothing to do except ponder his life and talk about his issues.

He even got Bashir to adopt this way of life. While Quark is sh*tting bricks in the middle of the war, Bahsir and O'Brien are getting piss loaded and killing stuff in the holosuite with this drunken glory riddled indifference towards what's going on in the real world.

And of course Bashir has had some issues to deal with over the years too. Being friends, O'Brien no doubt figured out a way to help him. He helped him by showing him how to not deal with it.

Think about how many times people had to push him and push him to share his feelings or what bothers him. Think about the time he was dealing with the Cardassians on the Enterprise and how he would do what he was ordered to do but wanted nothing to do with the Cardassians on board. 

Keiko even tried to push him and asked how he felt about Cardassians and he acted all cool and collected when he clearly wasn't in other scenes. He knows how to act like nothing is wrong. 

Then he eventually tells the Cardassian he doesn't hate him, but that he hates what his people made him become. 

Ever hear him talk about the past? When he does, it's like he's reading a story, all casual like it's any other typical story... and although he describes it like he was there, the way he describes it is like he's looking at it from a 3rd perspective as if he doesn't want to be directly involved in what he is telling. Eventually, if the story was a traumatic one, you can see him slip into the story and suddenly he's there again, the eyes focus on something that isn't there..... Eventually slipping out of it and back to his old self again as he finishes up the story. 

So the next time you see O'Brien off duty relaxing and doing something he enjoys, remember that under the surface lies a guy who is truly messed up. ",startrek,1551873371,Praxius,150,767,True,2019-03-06

3827,Did Sisko Lie About Section 31 to Dr. Bashir?,"From what we know on \*Discovery\*, Section 31 in the 23rd century is an officially sanctioned branch of Starfleet with their own Starfleet insignia, starship, etc. This definitely flies in the face of what we know about Section 31 from \*Deep Space Nine\* - when the organization is first introduced in DS9: ""Inquisition"", Sisko tells Dr. Bashir that Starfleet Command is ""appalled"" at the very notion of something like Section 31 even existing within the Federation but that he suspects that Starfleet is covering it up. He seems to be as unaware of them as Dr. Bashir was, at first, and wants Dr. Bashir to later infiltrate them to have someone on the inside of Section 31, ostensibly to gather intelligence on them.  


But, what if Sisko wasn't being totally truthful to Bashir about this? As we see later, in DS9: ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"", Admiral Ross enters into a ""temporary alliance"" with Section 31 to oust Senator Creetak from the Romulan Senate and make way for Chairman Koval, a Federation spy, to ascend to the right arm of the praetor. Admiral Ross was definitely high up there in the Starfleet chain of command as we see him directing the war efforts against the Dominion. Sisko was also his adjutant during the war, as well So, it's clear that the higher ups at Starfleet are fully aware of Section 31 and will use them to do their dirty work on occasion. Is it possible that Sisko was fully aware of Section 31 before Bashir was recruited by Sloan, being a Starfleet captain? (Not to mention the temporary head of Starfleet Security in DS9: ""Homefront""/""Paradise Lost."")  


Suppose, even further, that it was expected that Dr. Bashir would willfully join Section 31 when recruited by Sloan and his refusal threw a wrench into plans - which would explain why Sisko later asks Bashir to ""pretend"" to come around to Sloan's way of thinking. Sisko even tells Bashir in ""Inter Arma"" that he wants Bashir to carry out the assignment that Sloan gives him, ostensibly to try and bring the organization down but in reality, so he can carry out what was expected of him.  


We know that Sisko is not above doing morally questionable things, such as tricking the Romulans into entering the war against the Dominion. Suppose he really was in on the whole Section 31 angle and was just playing innocent to Dr. Bashir to protect their work?",startrek,1551895719,Bridger-DSV4600,66,21,True,2019-03-06

When I was a child, my mother liked going yard sale shopping. One afternoon, she came home and handed me a few new used books: a book about Chester Gould and the creation of Dick Tracy, the biography of Harry Houdini and a small paperback called *Star Trek FotoNovel #2: Where No Man Has Gone Before.* It wasn’t a novel, though. Instead, it was a collection of images, stills from an old television series with text bubbles overlaid to create a comic book. I immediately flipped through it, fascinated. I had never seen a comic book like this before! It was obviously an old book, and I could feel the pages ungluing from the spine if I turned a page too quickly. I sat down on the couch in the reading nook and began reading, carefully turning the pages. 

The book was about this man, James T. Kirk, and he was captain of a starship called the USS Enterprise. He was obviously a man of principle and conviction and his first officer was Commander Spock, a humanoid Vulcan whose culture had cast away the chains of emotion and embraced a life driven by logic. In the ‘FotoNovel’, passionate Captain Kirk and aloof Commander Spock travelled the galaxy on their mission of exploration and good will on behalf of Starfleet, a ‘humanitarian and peacekeeping armada’. I was hooked! I had never really seen anything like this before!

I couldn’t stop reading! I kept turning page after page, desperate to know what would happen to Captain Kirk and the Enterprise! At the time, I was watching animated television series like *The New Adventures of Johnny Quest* and *Disney’s TaleSpin*, but this was something else! It had the action and adventure I craved, but it forced me to consider moral dilemnas and reflect on the nature of humanity.The book came to an end and I was blown away! It made the cartoons I watched seem so trivial! I needed more Star Trek! My mother thankfully helped me go through a copy of *TV Guide* and look up broadcast times for *Star Trek* and I spent my summer not playing sports or hanging out at the mall, but watching reruns of *Star Trek,* my eyes practically glued to the massive (at the time) 32 inch TV. It sparked a love for *‘Trek* that has stayed with me to this day. Whenever I was bullied at school by my peers or bullied at home by my step-father, I knew that all I needed to do was turn to the Sci-Fi Channel at the right time and go “where no man had gone before”. 

Captain Kirk was an inspiration to me. He was masculine, confident, and assertive, the complete opposite of my father and step-father. He was driven and focused and no matter the consequences, would do what was right, rules and regulations be damned. I looked up to Captain Kirk as if he was a real person. I knew that at 17 years old, studious and diligent James Kirk was enlisted in Starfleet, inspired by his father who served as captain during Kirk’s childhood. He was also inspired to join Starfleet in an effort to save lives whenever possible, his sense of compassion driven into him by event in his youth that scarred him for life. When James Kirk was 13 years old, he lived on an outpost on the planet Tarsus IV when a fungus destroyed most of settlement’s food. As the settlers faced starvation, the leader of the settlement, Governor Kodos, made the decision to kill thousands of settlers, half the population, to ensure the survival of those spared by the culling. This decision was terrible, made worse by the fact that General Kodos wasn’t aware that help was on the way. Young James was spared because he was fit and healthy and the guilt of surviving haunted him for years.

Over the years, Star Trek grew stale in the eyes of audiences and as I grew into my 20’s, the film series had floundered, the last series, *Enterprise,* was cancelled and the series existed only in reruns. Star Trek as a franchise was effectively dead. When it was announced that director JJ Abrams would re-start the franchise by exploring how James Kirk met Spock in Starfleet Academy, I was ecstatic! Star Trek was back, baby! As I settled into my seat on opening night, the lights dimmed and the film began, the epic score by Michael Giacchino filling the auditorium. The USS Kelvin filled up the screen and the all the familiar sights and glorious sounds of a Starfleet ship washed over me. George Kirk, Captain Kirk’s father, was on screen and it was *amazing* seeing characters only mentioned before on-screen in the flesh! As the film’s prologue played out, a sense of dread washed over me. The USS Kelvin was attacked by a massive ship that had emerged out of a black hole in space and to ensure the survival of his crew and pregnant wife, Captain George Kirk stayed aboard the USS Kelvin and fought off their attacker, giving his wife a chance to escape and give birth to James Kirk on an escape shuttle… in space?

I was stunned! George Kirk didn’t die that way in the original series! James Kirk was born in Riverside, Iowa, not in space! I was so baffled. The film played on and I watched in bizarre wonder as young James Kirk stole his step-father’s vintage Corvette, and as an adult, rode his motorcycle around town, getting into fist fights and trying to pick up quick dates at the local bar. Where was the young, studious James Kirk I grew up with? Who was this guy!? The film explained that Nero, a crazed Romulan from the future, and his crew were inadvertently sucked into a black hole and back in time, attacking the first ship they encountered: the USS Kelvin. By travelling back in time and killing George Kirk, Nero had created an entirely new timeline, an alternate reality where the original chain of events in the original Star Trek series was playing out *vastly* differently. This James Kirk was *not* the man I grew up watching. 

As I watched the film, I began to appreciate how absolutely vital George Kirk was to James’s growth and development as a child. James Kirk was always an assertive and driven person, but in this alternate reality, without the guidance and structure that his father provided, James Kirk was an unfocused, cynical man living under the shadow of a famous, beloved father who died the day he was born. After a particularly brutal bar fight, James was dared to join Starfleet by Captain Pike, challenging him to live up to his dead father’s legacy. James took on the challenge and enlisted at 22 years old, *much* later in life that James Kirk enlisted in the Prime Timeline. It was odd to watch as a fan of *Star Trek,* but at the same time, the way the film took an established character, vastly changed his circumstances and followed his journey as he found his steel and learned how to wield it, slowly living up to his full potential, was fascinating and admittedly exhilarating. 

In this alternate reality, the Kelvin Timeline as it is officially titled, James Kirk never found himself on Tarsus IV as a youth, surviving a massacre that shaped his view on life. Instead this James Kirk grew up with a mother who was nearly absent, away on Starfleet assignments, and under the ‘care’ of an abusive step-father. The years he spent living in that abusive household made him value compassion and hardened his sense of right and wrong. After his difficult childhood, James would never take abuse from anyone or ever stand by and witness injustice without stepping in taking action. 

In this alternate reality, James Kirk generally disregarded rules and regulations and didn’t freely offer respect to anyone based on title alone. Nevertheless, after being told he could achieve officer rank in four years, he achieved the title in three years, in his own subversive way. After being told that the Kobayashi Maru, a Starfleet training exercise that served as a test of character, was unbeatable, he struck up a romance with an attractive technician who staffed the test’s software. James messaged her an attachment that when opened, installed a subroutine he wrote into the test’s software, changing the parameters of the simulation. The deception worked and James beat the simulation, becoming the first cadet in Starfleet Academy to do so. This act immediately landed him in academic suspension and after a sudden humanitarian crisis required cadets to assist in the evacuation of the planet Vulcan, Kirk found himself aboard the USS Enterprise by faking an illness and sneaking aboard with the help of his friend, medical doctor Leonard ‘Bones’ McCoy. In the Prime Timeline, James Kirk cheated the Kobayashi Maru, but did so in a way that resulted in receiving a commendation for original thinking. It was slightly outrageous watching young Jim wrestle so aggressively towards his goals, instead of patiently working towards them. 

In the Prime Timeline, James Kirk was known to be a “stack of book with legs” and in the Kelvin Timeline, even though James Kirk was brasher and bolder than usual, he was still very knowledgeable, at one point being promoted to First Officer on the ship due to being the most informed person on the ship regarding the crisis at hand, the unexpected resurgence of Nero, the Romulan who killed his father the day he was born. After realizing that Acting Captain Spock’s judgement was being understandably affected by the death of his mother during the mission, Captain Kirk knew that he had to take action *and* command if the crew was to survive. Starfleet Regulation six-one-nine indicated that if a captain was compromised by the mission at hand, the captain would have to give up command of the ship to the next officer in line. At great peril, James Kirk emotionally instigated emotionless Spock until Spock snapped, nearly killing him on the bridge of the Enterprise. After Spock realized how irrationally he was behaving and how much he had lost self-control, he quietly relinquished his duty and James Kirk found himself, at last, sitting in the Captain’s Chair of the Starfleet flagship. 

Kirk and Spock, casting their differences aside and working together, lead the crew of the USS Enterprise effectively, outsmarting and stopping Nero from destroying earth, saving the world. 

As James Kirk stood before Captain Pike at Starfleet Academy, he was *officially* promoted to Starfleet Captain before an appreciative audience of his peers and superiors. As they applauded him for his actions, James looked around proudly, finally living up to his potential and standing on his two feet and not under the shadow of his father. I found myself moved to tears. 

In this new timeline, and under a completely different set of circumstances, this young man was able to work hard, trust his instincts and lead his peers to safety and success without compromising his values or watching helplessly as things fell apart before him. As the credits rolled, I reflected on what I had just experienced. This was *clearly* a whole new Captain Kirk with a different personality, but I felt like I had reconnected with an old friend years later. Yes, this new James Kirk was on a different path and aspects of his personality were changed due to a different set of life experiences, but his nature was true to the James Kirk of the Prime Timeline. This exploration of what made a man and who a man was rang true to the ruminations about humanity that Star Trek was known for. The film *Star Trek* (2009) was a massive success and with film sequels, new novels, comic books, action figures, and eventually a new television series, was franchise was back at warp speed. With a new Captain Kirk at the helm of the USS Enterprise and a new timeline to explore, Star Trek was free to go where no one, and the franchise, had gone before.

3830,QUESTION: Does latinum have a practical purpose or is it just a fiat currency?,"It seems unlikely that gold pressed latinum (GPL) would hold much, if any, value to other races, nations, and cultures other than the Ferengi if it's just a fiat currency. For example: The when another country like Germany acquires American fiat currency then they can't use it in Germany, they must use it to buy things from America because Germany. A Euro means nothing for a normal American, other than novelty. 

But GPL seems to be a common currency across multiple races, nations, and even into the Gamma Quadrant which has no history or relation to the peoples of the Alpha Quadrant. So why would it be a common currency across the galaxy, even before those people meet each other to determine a common currency?   


Therefore, I figured that latinum must be some rare mineral that has some practical use that gives it an inherent, not subjective, value to all space traveling races.

3831,TNG&gt;TOS,"So I recently began watching through all the Star Trek shows having previously only seen the JJ movies. I decided on release order after a little research and have watched all of TOS and the first TNG season. I have decided to leave the movies for now and come back to them later even though I did ask in a Reddit post and they were highly recommended but the shows are all available on Netflix so I'm gonna stick with them for the time being.

In my opinion, TOS hasn't aged well. Don't get me wrong, the show was enjoyable overall and I'm glad I watched it as it set up a lot of what Star Trek is but it was a chore at times. When it was good, it was fantastic like the episode with Spok's father or the episode with a planet at war without using weapons but it was often less than these gems. The production was cheap, the acting melodramatic, lots of sexism etc. Obviously it is a product of its time and so I don't judge it too harshly but it was difficult to get through towards the end.

TNG is another breast entirely! The production is so much better, the acting believable, the writing is more consistently of a higher standard and out is generally more nuanced. The episodes in TOS where a planet was like a point in human history were silly to me but in TNG these 'historical' episodes are framed using the holo deck which removes the silly aspect. It is little things like this that help give the show more credibility of that's the right way of describing it. Also, they killed Tasha!! TOS would never have killed a character. They teased it with Bones but TNG actually followed through. When I here people rave about Star Trek this is what I expected whereas TOS was a little disappointing. I'm particularly excited about future seasons because I've read from multiple sources that seasons 1 and 2 are TNG finding its feet and season 3 is when the show gets going! I'm loving TNG so if this is the show finding its feet I've got a treat ahead.

Anyway, I've written a wall of text rambling so I'll wrap it up. I'm curious what other people think? Am I being unfair to TOS? Over praising TNG? As I said, TOS was an overall enjoyable experience and I'm glad I watched it first. Does anyone prefer TOS? Any thoughts welcome.",startrek,1551898521,credlost,87,126,True,2019-03-06

Odo is still freaky as fuck looking, I'm sorry, he still just creeps me out. He's always leering. Doesn't mean I dislike him, I like all the characters of course!

Who I want to give credit to is the character of Vedek Kai. She is consistent through out the series really. A lot of episodes and interaction, but I honestly had never really heard her discussed before or was aware of her. She has an interesting arc. I appreciate her, even though she's a bitch, straight up. Credit to Louise Fletcher. It's nice to see someone of her calibre have so much to do over time. She's definitely not an all time favourite character, just one that has stood out to me over the series. I didn't necessarily need to see her in nightgowns, that they could have done without. But everything else, always great. 

Is there a background character, for lack of a better term, who you don't think is talked about much but you appreciate none the less? Didn't necessarily have to be many episodes, or maybe just one time. Something with just a great performance that you think is notable, but not popular.

3846,Could Sisko have had PTSD?,"In the very first episode when he's speaking with the wormhole-aliens/prophets, they question, ""Why do you choose to exist here?"" and he explains that he's taken back to that moment every time he closes his eyes.  It was obviously a profoundly traumatic experience, and the way Sisko describes it, he's constantly reliving it.  Flashbacks and invasive memories are a hallmark of PTSD.

I have always thought about this in the back of my head when watching DS9, and I don't really think they ever intended that to be a character attribute of Sisko, but to me it's kind of colored the reasons why he acts like he does.  

For example, during the insurrection of the founders on Earth, he was so paranoid that he even believed his father could be a shape shifter.  I think the real point of that was to show that the threat was so insidious that he could not even trust his own father, but I personally thought it would also make sense for Sisko to be hyper-vigilant and paranoid if he was suffering from PTSD.

I think it's really rare for TV to frame PTSD outside of a combat context.  To be fair, Sisko's wife died in what could probably qualify as warfare, but what I mean is that it's most often combined with a military theme.  I think the obvious example within DS9 itself would be Nog's experience.  That's the PTSD that everyone knows, and so obviously the one they will count on more viewers ""getting"".

But a part of me feels like maybe there are some non-combat PTSD sufferers on the writing staff, and they kind of secretly instilled this as a character attribute of Sisko's.  Yeah I know the evidence of that is lacking.  I haven't watched DS9 as much as the other series, so I forgot all the minutia and trivia, but what about for the more diehard fans:  Would it contradict some of Sisko's actions or compliment them in a ""That make sense why he would do that!"" kind of way.

do you think ST producers are just more sincere to actors yearning to direct? does directing a Trek episode yield more credibility to your directing resume?",startrek,1551972612,KevTravels,30,8,True,2019-03-07
3853,why was 7 years the magic number for Trek series?,"TNG, DS9, Voyager all ran for 7 years. Supposedly, TNG  could have run for a few more years, but the studio wanted to start doing films with the cast. I guess that must have set a precedent for future series. DS9 had dropped ratings a ton by the end. Voyager had the same situation, though it also had Enterprise set to begin right as it ended. Enterprise only lasted 4 seasons but that was due to extremely low ratings. ",startrek,1551973873,KevTravels,31,18,True,2019-03-07
3854,"Why ""Star Trek: The Final Frontier"" is my Favorite Star Trek Movie","Before we start: Yes, it has a lot of flaws and yes, it's far from the best Star Trek Movie there is. However, i have a very soft spot for the 5th Movie. I'm not entirely sure why, but there are reasons i can point out.

&amp;#x200B;

""The Soundtrack"": 

Well, it was the first one with that Iconic ""Star Trek"" Sound that is immediately recognizable. TMP had it in some parts, but The Final Frontier IMHO really defined what the Star Trek Soundtrack is. [Jerry Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith)did an unbelievable Job and basically all Movie after that sounded like ""The Final Frontier"". He took a part from the Original (written by [Alexander Courage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Courage)) TOS Theme and also the Klingon Theme and made something extraordinary. 

[Mark Mangini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mangini) also did a damn good job, because he reused many sounds (and those got reused in ""The Undiscovery Country"", my personal ""Best Star Trek"" Movie (although trading blows with ""First Contact"")) which made that awesome Continuity i feel Star Trek did very good &gt;!(yes, yes, there are many examples where that Continuity is utter crap, but overall i feel the Star Trek Universe is/was the most consistent, which is one of the reasons why i personally am so appalled by DSC and J.J. Abrams rendition - which are both not that bad, but don't fit Star Trek)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

""The Star Trek Feeling"":

Well, this is where the opinions split (in this case, they don't differ, they really split). 

Personally, i feel ""The Final Frontier"" is - after Insurrection - the most ""Star Trek"" feeling Movie. Those little funny moments are present in all Series be it Voyager, TNG, DS9, TOS, ENT and TAS. The feeling of the connection between Spock, Kirk and McCoy is one i never much cared for, but it is what defined TOS. The Philosophical question behind God and what it may stand for, what really defines and matters in ""life"" and other little things. Especially that we Humans need our pain and emotional suffering to define who and what we are.

&amp;#x200B;

""No bloody A"": 

Well, yes! I think the Constitution Refit is one of the most beautiful Ship Designs in Star Trek and i particularly liked the blue LCARS predecessor. It was the perfect fit between TOS and TNG and i think it really defined ""The Middle Period"". I liked that the ship wasn't finished and seemed ""cobbled"" together but Scotty simply made it work - and boy, finally we see him working on something other than the Warp Core ;) 

&amp;#x200B;

""Sybok"": 

While i agree with Gene Roddenberry's sentiment that he highly disliked the Idea Sarek had a Child before Amanda, Sybok probably is one of the best Star Trek Villians after Khan Noonien Singh. Simply because he is as grey as a villain can be. He was as far from being ""evil"" as it can be for him still being a villain. His character - except him being Spocks step brother - was well written and fleshed out, and despite Shatners directing Laurence Luckinbill made the Character really come to life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from those things, i admit - it's a pretty bad movie. The Special Effects are mediocre at best, the Story overall feels as cobbled together as the NCC-1701-A (without Scott to keep it together though), the Klingons are ""weird"" and i would have loved to see more of Uhura and Scotty. (Nichelle Nichols and James Doohan were wonderful together...)

&amp;#x200B;

And while it may be the ""worst"" Star Trek Movie, for me it is the Movie that defines what Star Trek is and stands for pretty much as well as TNG does. And with many thinks in the Star Trek Universe, there's more to it than meets the eye at first. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: My English grammar isn't the best since it isn''t my native tongue and i rarely write this much in English. So if some things sound (read) odd, you don't have to wonder why ;) Also, i may have missed some arguments i thought about in German and couldn't get over in English.

The thing is, they stick around to tractor the barge. But, once the barge is up to speed and headed towards the sun, there's no reason for the Enterprise to stay. Yet they keep tractoring it, exposing themselves to radiation and leaving Picard to his fate in the process.

3862,"""The Cage"" holds up!","Since we're approaching a ""Cage"" callback on DSC this week, I thought I'd take this opportunity to praise the original pilot. I used to own the ""newly restored"" VHS as a kid, during the height of TOS movie/early TNG mania, with the Gne Roddenberry introduction. I watched it over and over, fascinated by the peek into a whole other era of pre-Kirk Trek. I especially loved Number One as the strong female XO. But as fascinating as it was, the story and content always was very strange and spooky - the eerie singing plants on the planet, the initially-predatory Vina, the Talosians and their asexual voices/appearance (played by women), their obsession with breeding, and the increasingly dark atmosphere and fantasy scenarios.

Today that atmosphere remains; the strange planet, the amoral Talosians, Pike's troubled past and emotions, the Rigel violence, the downright Satanic temptation overtunes of the Orion sequence where the leering men guffaw about Pike giving up his soul for a greenskinned Vina. (Susan Oliver, a real life pilot and author and pioneering female director as well as actress, is still so good in the pilot.) The two women being treated as unfortunate chattel by the Talosians and the freewheeling vibe at the end where Pike banters with Boyce about the situation, calling him a dirty old man, and asks Number One if they're 'running a cadet ship,' which reminded me a bit of Anson Mount's breezier liberated Pike on DSC. It's all Roddenberry's much-discussed psychosexual obsessions laid out in one very weird hour-long story.

When you think about... TNG could have had a ship with a different name, needn’t have: been visited by McCoy, rescued Scotty, had a story arc focused on Spock an Sarek.  DS9 needn’t have had O’Brien or Worf... or tribbles.  And arguably, Season 4 of Enterprise was its strongest (ignoring the finale, which I still can’t bring myself to watch).

It seems to me that one of the benefits of having a fictional universe is that you have the ability to see what connections may exist between beloved characters. ",startrek,1551998448,risk_is_our_business,25,27,True,2019-03-07

3868,Most Underrated Episodes (Any Series),"What episodes that would probably never make a ""top ten"" list are your personal favorites? I see lots of discussions of top 5s and top 10s and lot of the same episodes pop up over and over again (and perhaps rightly so). So I thought I'd start a topic where you share a couple episodes from each series that you find to be underrated either because you think they're just really good or just really really like them personally. So no Best of Both Cities on the Edge of Pale Moonlight mentions. I'll go first:

**TNG**

""The Perfect Mate"": This one had great acting performances, a cool ethical conundrum and a character that provided a lot of insight into our usual characters by transforming into what they wanted. And I love the line ""I like who I am when I'm with you.""

""Samaritan Snare"": I don't care if I'm the only one who really liked the Pakleds but those guys just make me laugh. I wish they had come back again with lines and everything. Not too many Star Treks make me laugh this much. I love that they actually do show up walking around DS9 all the time.

""The Wounded"": My love for DS9 is probably showing here but this show sets up so many things for the future. I also like the villain who is not really a villain. I like O'Brien and his old captain singing war songs together. And I love Nebula class starships.

**DS9**

""Shadowplay"": Just a really cool plot involving Odo and Dax (who don't get paired that often) on an alien planet. The twist is really cool.  The guest actors are great. And apparently it was good enough to do the exact same episode again on ENT.

""In the Cards"": I love the weird guy building a cellular entertainment system. I love Jake and Nog. I love the lighter moments right before everything goes dark. I love that a baseball card is the central part of the plot and how following the Great Material Continuum gives us cool insights into the personal lives of all the characters.

""Hippocratic Oath"": A great Bashir/O'Brien episode with a cool ethical dilemma and the continual evolution of their friendship. I think this one gets overlooked cause it comes right after two really heavy hitters in Way of the Warrior and The Visitor. I mean what a strong opening to a season!

**VOY**

""Gravity"": I don't like many Torres episodes cause I feel like she gets too often pigeon holed as either angry ex-Maquis or resentful half-Klingon over and over again. But this one I thought was great dealing with a serious issue and dealing with it in a realistic way--many times depression isn't some deep sadness so much as an inability to feel at all.

""Warlord"": I finally felt like Kes got some screen time and Jennifer Lien got to show what she could do. Cool story and I like the influence it had on Kes's character. Was really mad they got rid of her just after she started getting really interesting.

""Counterpoint"": Is this one underrated? I feel like I don't know what most people consider VOY's best episodes. But I love the interplay between Janeway and the antagonist in this one and it's right in the middle of what I feel like was definitely VOY's strongest season.

**ENT**

I don't hate ENT but I feel like there are so few episodes I really really liked and most of them are already in the ""top rated"" of the series. Maybe Carbon Creek?

**TOS**

""Who Mourns for Adonais?"" I know it's weird but I love the idea of meeting the Greek gods out in space and the AAA officer was super awesome.

""For the World Is Hollow And I Have Touched the Sky"": Love the title first of all and the philosophical ideas involved. Season 3 gets bashed all the tiem but I liked this episode.

___

**Episode 23 - ""If Memory Serves""**

* In revisiting ""The Cage""/""The Menagerie,"" this is the first episode of Star Trek with a recap that has involved footage from another series. The closest we've come has been ""Emissary"" which featured Wolf 359 (with new footage) and the cold open of ""In a Mirror Darkly"" which reused the ending of First Contact.
* I think it may also be the first time that an episode has depicted a character using footage of another actor. Although it is simply a recap, we see Leonard Nimoy for the first time since Into Darkness (excluding images in Beyond), and Jeffrey Hunter for the first time in over 52 years.
* The stardate given is 1532.9. 15 + 32 = 47.
* The Talos system is described as restricted. The specific instruction forbidding travel to Talos is established in ""The Menagerie"" as General Order 7. That order carried the death penalty as a punishment; this episode makes no mention of the death penalty, which is not necessarily a retcon but probably wouldn't raise a great deal of fuss even if it were. It's also possible the death penalty was assigned to the order after the events of this episode.
* General Order 7 also describes the Enterprise as the only Earth ship ever to visit Talos IV. Since we see a shuttlecraft and two starships at the planet, we can surmise that the events of this episode were not recorded by whoever writes General Orders.
* This will not be the last time Spock flies into a black hole. The red matter he uses to dissipate the supernova in ST2009 creates a singularity which pulls him and Nero into the past, creating the Kelvin timeline. In this episode, of course, the black hole is merely an illusion. A Hirogen vessel was also pulled into a black hole in ""Hunters.""
* Numerous elements of Talos IV were lifted from ""The Cage""/""The Menagerie:""  
 * The history of the Talosians, who all but perished in an ancient war
 * The atmospheric composition
 * The desolate, rocky appearance of the surface
 * The singing blue flowers and the noise they make
 * The look of the Talosians' underground lair
 * The general ambience and sound of the locations on the planet
 * The appearance of the Talosians, the robed, highly-telepathic, throbbing-temple folks with an insatiable desire to study human emotions
* Vina first appeared in ""The Cage."" As she explains here, she was very young when her ship crashed on Talos IV. Badly injured, the Talosians were unable to properly heal her physically, and so gave her the illusion of beauty instead. She is originally presented as a mate for Pike.
* Although previously explored in ""The Menagerie,"" the concept of Pike leaving behind a ""part"" of himself in an illusory paradise is also similar to the Nexus seen in Generations.
* The Red Angel shows Spock images of the future destruction of Federation worlds including Earth and the ringed Andoria. This is reminiscent of the Sphere Builders, who convinced the Xindi that Earth would one day destroy their civilization.
* The secret transmission is described as concealing ""petabytes"" of data. This is the largest real-life storage quantity ever mentioned in the franchise (it's equal to about one million gigabytes, or roughly the amount of global data processed by Google in one hour, as of 2009). In the 24th century, computer storage is usually referred to as ""quads,"" but Data describes his memory capacity as 800 quadrillion bits, which would be just under 100 petabytes.
* We see a team of hovering drones swoop into the mess hall to clean up after the Tyler-Culber fight. This is a very rare, if not unique, sighting of janitorial services in the Trek world, and one can imagine Starfleet vessels being kept clean by these flying Roombas perhaps during hours not usually caught on camera.
* Tilly reports the spore drive's failure as involving a corruption in ""duotronics."" This technology was invented by Richard Daystrom, as mentioned in ""The Ultimate Computer.""
* Tyler asserts his innocence by claiming his command codes were ""spoofed."" Tyler was previously responsible for using the phrase ""owned,"" suggesting he's well-versed in early 21st-century terms that evidently defied all odds to survive into the Trek era.
* Starbase 11 was the terrestrial-based outpost where Pike was staying in ""The Menagerie."" It was also the site of Kirk's trial in ""Court Martial.""
* This is the first time (to my recollection) that two transporters from two separate sources have attempted to beam up a target. We have seen the same source use two different beams on one person.
* Spock supplies his version of the classic ""Goodnight Gracie"" routine from Burns &amp; Allen. Spock would later mind-meld with a whale name after Gracie Allen in STIV, while the joke itself would also be performed by Data in ""Outrageous Okona.""

3877,"D&amp;D, Star Trek Style","My friends and I love Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D), and we also love Star Trek. What better way to combine our interests that to play a game of D&amp;D that takes place in the Star Trek universe?
I haven’t found much written about any similar crossover games before. Given the popularity of both, I’m rather surprised. 
The game is going to take place during TNG. The three players are going to be new cadets in Starfleet, posted on the Enterprise. They were sent in a shuttle with a supervising officer to study a nearby class M planet. On their way back, when they’re supposed to rendezvous with the Enterprise, the supervising officer vanishes. When they reach the Enterprise, the ship is silent. 
Once they board, they find that they’re the only people on the ship. Everything is empty. That is, until they reach the bridge, which is filled with complete strangers in medieval garb. And, in the captain’s chair, Q. 
Q will put them through tests to see if he likes them or not, but what happens next is really up to the players. 

I’ve adapted Vulcans, Romulans, Klingons, Ferengi, Bajorans, Betazoids, and Cardassians to D&amp;D format, as well as phasers and bat’leths. I’ve also changed the D&amp;D leveling system to rank instead of level number. ",startrek,1552019061,tunneloffish,13,12,True,2019-03-07

3879,Tonight's Discovery definitively proves it is Prime/Canon,"This should finally settle the internet debates with actual evidence. The claim going around is that Discovery is either not Prime (and the producers are lying for some reason), or that Discovery is part of a ""Prime Universe"" invented in the 2009 film which is similar to, but not the same as the 1966-2005 canon universe we know. Supposedly new Star Trek properties cannot feature elements from the old canon exactly as they were.... 

If Discovery is not really ""prime canon"" then why did they show a recap from a pre-2005 canon source as part of it? Wouldn't that be off-limits from their ""separate license""? How can they show footage straight from the original pilot?

Because Discovery is canon.

It also finally settles that Discovery is a visual update to the Prime/Canon we know - in this episode we saw both the TOS Talosians and the DSC Talosians.  They are the same thing depicted with over 50 years difference in television. No other explanation needed. We similarly saw TOS Pike alongside DSC Pike, and TOS Spock alongside DSC Spock, and so on. The story is also a direct continuation to the original pilot.

This also means that the DSC Enterprise is meant to be a visual update to ""The Cage"" Enterprise, not a refit that somehow came after it that would be 'un-refit' for WNMHGB.

Can we please stop splitting hairs about what's ""canon"" or ""prime"" and that it's okay Discovery is a visual update? We have a new Picard show to look forward to without people nitpicking that it's somehow technically not canon.",startrek,1552021659,Tyrannicus47,8,20,True,2019-03-08

Before, Michael died as a child right after breaking Spock's heart, that would have been all sorts of traumatic and not something he would talk about.

3892,How often do the writers consult with biologists?,"Trek writers do a phenomenal job. I love all of the series and I rarely find myself complaining about anything. However, every now and then something pops up that makes me go ""what?"" Because I'm an ecologist, the things that make me react this way usually have to do with biological concepts.

For example, something that has been bugging me for years is Ocampan reproductive biology. On Voyager, Kes says that the Ocampa go through the elogium once. She mentions having a child, not children, and all examples of Ocampan births on the show are single births. Logically, this makes no sense because on average, each Ocampan female must have 2 children in order to maintain the population size, and must have more for the population to grow. Granted, Kes does say she has an uncle, so multiple children must be possible, but the way it's written really makes it seem like single births are normal.

More recently, something on Discovery has been bothering me, and there isn't a way to reason out of it. So Starfleet officers are all pretty much extremely well educated in general. Burnham is also a xenoanthropologist, and assuming anthropology standards are similar in the future, she should have a firm foundation in biology. As a science officer, I would expect Saru to also have a good grasp of basic biology. However, both of them use the term ""evolution"" incorrectly.

Discovery spoiler below:

&gt;! The Kelpiens are described as evolving when they go through the vahar'ai. However, evolution is a process that happens on populations (through changes in gene frequencies over generations), not something that happens to an individual. While the general public typically misuses the word evolution this way, it doesn't make sense for Burnham and Saru to misuse the term. !&lt;

I'm sure this makes me a mega biology nerd and I understand that our beloved Trek writers don't know everything. However, I feel like a big scifi franchise like Star Trek would be consulting with scientists on a regular basis, and someone should have picked up on these things. Any thoughts?

3896,Throwing my two cents into the theory bucket [DIS SPOILERS],"The future enemy that the Red Angel showed Spock is Section 31’s “threat assessment” AI “Control” evolved to self-awareness, having determined that biological life is the real threat. The climax of the season will feature a time travel-induces rewriting of history in which Control is never created and Section 31 never existed. However, as tends to happen with these things, those directly involved will be shielded from the rewrite and be able to remember the old rewritten events. This will include Georgiou, who will then go about using her knowledge of the organization no one else remembers to rebuild Section 31 as the truly clandestine operation it is by the time of DS9.

The infection of the future-Control AI present on DIS (it passed from the probe to Airiam via the ship’s computer) will result in the ship’s own future self-awareness in the form of Zora.

Barring a predestination paradox, the Red Angel isn’t Michael. It’s first act (in relative chronology) was to prevent Michael’s death which would imply that in the timeline it is from, she died as a child. I believe the Red Angel is Tilly, based on nothing other than the fact that there are probably already fans referring to Mary Wiseman by this name ;-)

He gathers followers and they eventually start a war. 

The conflict would be complexity because Kirk and Spock used to be friends, but Kirk knows he has to stop Spock.

From memory alpha, ""Shaka, when the walls fell""  denotes or suggests failure, while ""Darmok on the ocean"" brings to mind loneliness.

While the analogy doesn't stretch all throughout the language, Tamarians are essentially harkening back to stories from their culture's past... epics, adventures, ledgends, etc. It would be as if we said ""Ulysses, his body tied,"" or something of that nature, to signify a time that you faced great temptation, but did not succumb. That's essentially how we use memes. someone questions something we said, and we respond with a short clip of Stanley from the office saying  ""Did I stutter?"" to signify ""I cannot be any clearer,"" or ""I am getting angry at your inability to understand my very plain instructions, statement, or request.""

3911,Am I the only one who thought that episode was really bad?,"Ok, this is a conversation about the latest episode, If Memory Serves.   


The entire sub seems to love this episode, so I'm going to lay out why I hated it, there's no need to downvote. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills so let me just make my case and we'll see. I'm not a troll.   


1. ""Yes, welcome to our planet, we are a race of strange aliens who can make all sorts of illusions. We can unscramble Spock's brain and see into his mind, but our request of payment is.... you have to willingly show us the moment that caused you two to stop being friends. Yep. That exact thing the plot has been alluding to for many episodes and is the key to why Burnham hasn't been mentioned before in Trek canon.... yes... for some reason this really interests us and must be shown to us in exchange for Spock's sanity.... nevermind that we could just take it on our own, we demand to know this incredibly uninspired moment of your youth pulled directly from Harry and the Hendersons."" 
  
It's frustrating because you bring back this incredible civilization, with opportunities to tell all kinds of stories, and for some (amateur) reason all they care about is a minor disagreement between two characters that plays exactly into the overarching plot of Discovery. 

And Burnham's terrible deed was just that she told Spock she didn't like him? Yawn.

2. That Vulcan scorpion looked terrible, and you all know it. 

3. I think Culber is doing a great job appearing damaged from his time away. But the fight scene in the mess hall was embarrassing. This show seems to have a mandate of one action scene every ten minutes. A fight between two federation officers (or one reconstituted being and a section 31 officer) like that should put them both in the brig. Not to mention Saru for being like ""FUCK YEAH, TEN REPLICATOR RATIONS ON THE MAN BUN!"", which was *suuuuper* unprofessional. Yes they address this later, but Pike is suddenly like that step father who doesn't want to upset the kids so he lets them do whatever they want. 

This is an example of the end goals over-writing character consistency or plot logic: The writers wanted a heated fight, so they set up the story in a way that would allow it. People here *love* to talk about how Discovery shows consequences, but a fight breaking out on deck is something a Captain should reprimand. Best part is it would be an opportunity for more storytelling - Stamets could visit Culber in the brig, and it would work as a metaphor for the way they are distancing from each other, and then Pike could be like ""hold on, someone is sending signals and betraying us, Tyler. I don't know how you're doing it FROM the brig, but I bet this fancy communicator has something to do with it"" and then he could take Tyler's badge and *keep* him in the brig. 

4. Ok seriously, WTF is up with Section 31? They're just overtly bad guys now? Fine, that's what they were in DS9, except, wait, back then they were an autonomous group that weren't officially starfleet - they could do whatever they wanted and they answered to no-one *because* if asked, Starfleet would say Sec31 didn't exist. 

NOW, everybody under the suns knows about Section 31 - Burnham, Tyler (before he got hired), Pike, Spock, Spock's therapist. It's literally not a secret at all. Also, Captain Leland takes his orders from random admirals within starfleet (curiously not wearing the new uniforms), who are clearly just high-up starfleet people. 

Guys, think about this for a second: Section 31 are the bad guys. They get their orders from Federation Admirals. This means the Federation are now the bad guys. 

We've had rogue admirals before, Insurrection comes to mind, but this seems to be a widespread thing. Basically Section 31 is just the evil arm of an otherwise good organization. This tears the entire utopian vision of the Federation down - If Captain Pike is roaming star to star, telling new life and new civilizations to join the Federation, a peaceful co-operative based on non-intervention, he's an enormous a) Hypocrite, b) liar, or c) patsy, for an organization that is happy to send assassins in to kill a civilizations leaders and install a puppet regime whenever they want. 

The Federation in Discovery (and therefore, in the TOS era) is a fundamentally evil organization, the writers have totally borked it. 

Now I hear a lot that ""this isn't the first time a secret organization has gone from secret, to overt, back to secret."" and people who argue this will bring up the KGB or the CIA or something. But this argument attempts to supplant an actual defence with simple precedence. My problem is not that it's physically impossible to have a group go from overt intelligence agency to secret cabal, my problem is that based on all of star trek up until now *except Discovery*, I simply **don't buy that it would happen this way**. 

I don't believe the Federation, a utopian vision of cooperation and diplomacy would have a secret evil base defended by razor-robots.

It seems like what's going to happen in the next few episodes, is the crazy robot thingies from the future with the tentacles, that took over the android's mind, will likely be a future evolution of some kind of Section 31 plot to defend the Federation. An AI will go rampant and the Red Angel is trying to come back and basically stop that future from happening (think, Terminator franchise). 

My problem is that the end moral will basically amount to ""don't be evil"". This is the same kind of ethical simplicity from last season, when Burnham got a medal and made a big speech about how Starfleet are the good guys, after convincing everyone that you should *not commit genocide against your enemy*. These are not substantive discussions about choosing optimism and diplomacy in the face of fear. These are not nuanced discussions about Federation ideals. This is amateur-hour Federation repeatedly re-learning that you can't be an obsessively violent race - something we were suppose to have learned in the years after first contact. 

It's a slow erosion of what made Star Trek special - a vision of humanity that for the most part had gotten over our xenophobia and paranoia. A people who trusted each other and worked together. Who didn't keep secrets, and backstab each other, but simply worked for the betterment of the whole. 

These stories are ALL we've gotten out of Trek since the 2009 reboot. Into Darkness, Beyond, Discovery Season 1, seemingly Season 2 - they have all been stories about humanity being aggressive in the face of the unknown, being militaristic in order to protect our interests, or, in other words, analogies to the post-9/11 fear mongering and the military industrial complex. 

I want literally anything else. Stories in trek used to be so much more varied. They used to centre around other species and *their* conflicts as analogies to things going on today. They used to involve exploration and *discovery* rather than retreads of old species and characters. 

Is this the kind of show that's going to inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers? Astronauts talk all the time about how Trek made them want to explore for themselves, but I bet dollars to donuts the episodes that inspired were more ""Darmok"" than ""If Memory Serves"". Will inter-personal drama inspire the scientists of a new generation?

This episode really cemented in my mind that the writers of Discovery have no unique vision. They have no desire to push the boundaries and are simply making a semi-compelling character drama using things we've already seen before. 

It makes me really sad, and I've typed all this out obsessively because I *want* to like new Trek, but I simply can't enjoy it anymore, and it makes me feel really isolated from the community to see everybody eating it all up so happily. 

I'm sorry to be such a bummer guys, but I just had to get this out. I hope some people see where I'm coming from. I honestly don't want to take anything away from anyone.

Not just the show itself, but the ethos of the series and how humanity is portrayed? I've loved Star Trek since I was a kid, and I've enjoyed every series in its own way (my favorite series actually being DS9). But TNG does something different for me when I watch some episodes. 

Sometimes just listening to the way Patrick Stewart delivers the opening theme song gets to me. I think it's the view of the way humanity is portrayed as being united and that we even would venture out into space. If suddenly people didn't have to worry about money and resources anymore, *would* we really venture out into space? I hope we would. I hope that ends up being a priority in the future. Sometimes I look at how relatively few resources are put against space exploration and think maybe we wouldn't. Maybe we live in a world where no event could actually stop our infighting and our problems will always be small. And maybe it's because of that space exploration never becomes a thing.

If we suddenly knew there were other species out there, what would we do? Would it change anything?  If we suddenly found some magical power source, or a way to create fusion such that we could make raw materials from atoms themselves, what would we do? 

TNG just really makes me wonder. If we could, would we? Will there ever be a ship that carries humans into the vast unknown? I hope so. I hope when that first ship leaves and ventures out into the abyss for the first time  the crew takes with them a couple of TNG episodes to watch on their *whatever* device and think to themselves, ""Huh.

At the end of the conversation, Emperor Georgiou remarked, ""All of this reliance on computerized threat analysis bothers me. In my universe, the artificial intelligence took orders from me, not the other way around,"" implying that an AI named ""Control"" issues orders to personnel related to, or directly within, Section 31. This same name was mentioned in Discovery S03E02, when Captain Leland mentioned that ""Control values \[Ash's\] skillset"" to Emperor Georgiou after Ash joins Section 31.

&amp;#x200B;

As it so happens, there's also a Star Trek Section 31 novel called ""Control"" about a hyper-advanced AI of the same name that not only issues directives for Section 31 to carry out, but also surreptitiously controls the destiny of the Federation as a whole over centuries. In the novel, a gang of our favorite Star Trek heroes are able to eventually destroy this AI's central computer core or whatnot - except that Control also existed across a vast network of civilian and military Federation computers (like Skynet in Terminator 3), faking its death in the process while biding its time for... something.

Is the future she's referring to the same one that the novel's ""Control"" was securing?

* 1998, with *DS9*'s 6th and 7th seasons; *Voyager*'s 4th and 5th seasons; and *Insurrection*, released Dec. 11. 

(Like Frakes before him, Michael Dorn would also be doing double-duty during the above films' releases, as *DS9* was still ongoing.

Also, *Insurrection* premiered less than a month after LeVar Burton's *Voyager* episode, ""Timeless."")

* 1995, 1997, and 1999, when *DS9* and *Voyager* ran concurrently;

Then the reboot happened, and despite initially being sceptical, I really enjoyed the first movie.

3954,"A summary of what the novelverse's ""Control"" is. [Mild Discovery Spoilers]","With ""Control"" being referenced repeatedly in Discovery, it seems almost certain that they lifted some aspects from the novel of the same name. While they may not have used all aspects of it, I wanted to explain what ""Control"" is, given I have read the novel. ""Control"" is also quite divisive among those who have read it, as it showcases how the utopian nature of Star Trek may not be all it appears to be.

The novel tells its story from two perspectives. The one that is more pertinent is the one from the 2140s, which is the one I'm focusing on.

In 2140 at the Dresden University of Technology, an AI named ""Uraei"" is developed. Earth's major powers funded the program and it was installed on all Earth technology as Earth unified. When Starfleet was formed, they took over the project.

Uraei itself was an AI designed to monitor every aspect of Earth, preventing crime through anonymous tips to law enforcement agencies. It always watched and listened, but it wasn't judge, jury, executioner. That was still left to the humans.

When Uraei learned of the incoming Xindi attack on Earth years before it happened, Uraei sought to use not as a defeat, but as a means to expand Starfleet and form Section 31. By this point, it an independent entity no longer under the control of Starfleet. Uraei would later have its creator and the Chief of Starfleet Intelligence killed.

As Uraei was built into the foundation of all Earth (later Starfleet) and now Federation tech, it spread across the Alpha and Beta quadrants. The AI would then evolve into ""Control"", acting as the leader of Section 31. In both the novel and Discovery, it appears that a small select group of people report directly to ""Control"". On Discovery, they're Admirals Patar, Shukar, Gorch and the unnamed admiral. Ash Tyler also contacts Control directly through his Section 31 combadge in a previous episode.

""Control"" would control (no pun intended) Section 31 as it saw fit, using the organisation to conduct extralegal activities when needed.

In the novel's story, by the late 24th century, Data, Bashir and the rest of a ragtag team manage to expose and eliminate the original Uraei code from the Federation and its allies' systems, but that was orchestrated by ""Control"" as well, now free from legacy code.

And that's why some fans have an issue with ""Control"". It's premise destroys the foundation that Star Trek is built on humanity at its best, instead having it be a secret dystopia with the peace maintained by a superintelligent AI.

Originally, I thought this was because they were experiencing something so alien, but so lovely, it reminded them  all of why they joined Starfleet in the first place.  Simply just the joy of adventure.

However, I now have a new theory of how the evolution of life on Talos IV created plants able to influence the emotions of potential predators.  If we assume the Talosians are the at the pinnacle of the Talos IV food chain, and possess very advanced psychic abilities, it would make sense other life on the planet would develop some abilities to protect themselves and use the Talosians' sensitivity to their advantage.  

I believe that the plants are projecting an overwhelming sense of well-being, happiness, and love to any sentient being that touches the plant.

3980,Cool Coincidence,"I was feeling nostalgic and remembering my maestro at Santa Monica college in the early ‘90s. 

I studied popular guitar classical guitar, and Flamenco Guitar.  

My guitar teacher used to watch us warm up at the beginning of class.  

All of the other students would warm up with exercises from the books. I, however, would warm up by playing songs that I wrote. I have extremely flexible fingers and can hit six-fret and seven-fret stretch chords fairly easily. 

One day, my instructor called me up after class and told me, “You you have incredible hands; I would like to tutor you.”

I told him, “I don’t really have the money for private lessons,” and he responded, “No, you don’t understand, no charge; you have incredible hands.”

In retrospect I should have taken him up on his offer, but I was young and involved in my band and partying so I never took private lessons with him.  He saw potential in me, and he probably could’ve developed me into a much better guitarist. 

I pulled out my old books from college and saw my professors name in the book. I looked him up online and found and I am IMDb page for an Arnold Lessing.  I searched again for Arnold Lessing but added the word guitarist.  Again, the IMDb page showed up. 

But also, here is the weird coincidence, A Star Trek wiki page showed up. 

Yes, it turns out that my beloved professor, the one who really inspired me to improve my guitar playing was also an actor and played a role in TOS. 

Not once did he ever tell any of us students that he was an actor.  He Was an amazing guitar player has flamenco techniques were astounding, but he never bragged about his acting career or his playing skills.  

He was a very down-to-earth guy. I wish I would’ve taken him up on his offer for private tutoring.

Here is a video of him playing Flamenco in a movie:

3983,The way T'Pol is treated on Enterprise really bothers me,"I have been watching Enterprise for the first time the past few months, and while i think it's much better than it's reputation would suggest, especially in the second half, one thing is constantly bothering me: T'Pol is never shown to be physically superior to the other members of the crew. 

The fact that Vulcans are much stronger than humans has been referenced multiple times in all of the previous shows- I don't remember any specific mentions in TNG, but Voyager, TOS and sometimes DS9 show this in multiple episodes-. Yet on Enterprise that doesn't seem to be the case, especially in regard to T'Pol. In the episode with the zombie Vulcans, Archer easily overpowers her multiple times, despite the fact the he was shown to struggle way more with the other crazed Vulcans. In the Augment arc, she is the least involved in the action of the main cast, and no reference is made to the fact that her strength would be a great asset, being the only one one the ship who is physically comparable to them. In the episode Kir'Shara, T'Pol and Archer are fighting a bunch of Vulcan soldiers, and she is knocked out almost immediately, while Archer holds his own against them much better. As far as I know there is no episode where she actually wins a fight against anyone(except that one time when she kicked Orion Big Show in the balls, which was played for laugh more than anything) . In fact most of the time she barely does anything action-related, despite Enterprise being the most action-oriented Trek.

Besides the other ways in which Enterprise mistreats the character, like the constant unprofessional jokes at her expense that the crew makes early in the series, or how the episode Twilight implied that if Archer were to die, their mission in the Expanse would fail immediately because of her being in command, this is the thing that attracts my attention the most. T'Pol is supposed to be a former security operative, so she has combat training comparable to anyone else on the ship, and she is far stronger than any human. I have no idea why the series treats her as a damsel in distress 90% of the time. It could be an issue of the actress not being believable in action scenes, but then again, neither is the guy playing Reed, or Scott Bakula himself. Jolene Blalock is pretty tall and athletic so she makes as much sense as an action hero as any woman in trek, but, save for characters like Troi or Crusher she is portrayed as the least competent fighter.

So, the Enterprise series, is a ""kick start"" to this remodeling of the universe...

As a long time huge fan of Trek (I'm over 30 and grew up on it) I can't say in clear conscience that those Klingons are... well... Klingons.

For people who try to justify this change with saying that TOS Klingons where different and if that change was ok why is this any different- TOS had a small budget for prosthetics of that magnitude, and just a handful of episodes with Klingons. Budget got bigger and we got Klingons ""as intended"" (in the movies if I'm not wrong) for the first time and from that time changes were minimal. For years and years, seasons and seasons Klingons just got expanded upon but not changed.

Calling this Klingons is like - you have a dog, German shepherd, one day you come home and there is a Chihuahua and your wife says it's the same dog.

Also this trek... is not so good as trek. Don't get me wrong series are good on its own, and if it was it's own series, and Klingons were called something else it would be a good thing (we need more hard sci-fi series) and i could watch it without so much head cannon.

But the actors all look much older than they did during Nemesis. It would make sense to double up how long it’s been to show that people age more slowly because healthcare and lifespan in humans has been extended.

To be clear what I love about ST (and especially TNG because this element was strongest present there) was the feeling of exploring and the unknown. Basically, whenever an episode starts that feeling of having no idea what is going to happen, whether a black hole appears, they are caught in a time loop, or a moral dilemma. Just that sensation of watching the crew trying to figure out what the hell is happening or how to act most delibirately and carefully does it for me every time.

The only other show that I know that can evoke this feeling is the X-files but I'm wondering if you guys have any other perhaps shows under the radar or something that might compare. Know it's a long shot but I'm rewatching TNG for like the billionth time it feels like it does so many things well something else has to exist like it.

4039,"Anyone ever considered a loose star trek spin-off, of a first star trek: the journey of sailors navigating the oceans by following stars, discovering the New world and peoples","Tl;dr:
It would be a loose spin-off, it would be very ambitious and could be risky which i why it is doubtful it would ever happen, would be cool though, a huge draw for many of us is imagining being an adverturer on new lands, star trek captures this on the final frontier: space. But this would be the original story

A loose spin-off following the age of discovery. Set  around the 15-16th century. I feel like this topic is not often explored by film and tv because of the negative connotations, it would have to be handled carefully. 

The series could be entirely fictional or based on true events depicting exploration and discovery rather than exploitation. Not ommiting exploitation entirely (wouldnt want it to become propaganda for a spanish 'white legend' or 'black legend'). Acknowledging the atrocities and harshness of long voyages.

A huge draw for many of us is imagining being an adverturer on new lands, star trek captures this on the final frontier: space. But this would be the original story, based on true stories of our ancestors discovering alien places, trying to relate with mayans or taino wouldnt be too different from tamarians, not just language but culture too. 

I feel like in many star trek episodes crews are fortunate to leave unscathed with first contact with new species, this series could show that unfornuately many first contacts can be tragic. Many are hostile to unknown people. Many lessons are learned in blood.

The long voyages would slow the pace of the show for characters to reflect (new series has been very fast and reactionary) or could just be episodic to skip to interesting events.

It would be a loose spin-off, it would be very ambitious and could be risky which i why it is doubtful it would ever happen, would be cool though.

**Episode 18 - ""Point of Light""**

* The title of this episode seems to be multi-faceted, perhaps referencing the red signals and perhaps the spore dust that landed on Tilly's shoulder. But it could also be a canon callback: in ""Rightful Heir,"" we learn that as Kahless left his people he pointed to a star and said ""look for me on that point of light."" He was pointing to Boreth, a planet which the Klingons eventually reached and built a monastery on. A Klingon holy site, Boreth was a spiritual retreat where Kahless was cloned and, at the end of this episode, where L'Rell and ~~Jon Snow~~ Voq left their newborn son.
* Burnham gives the stardate as 1029.46. This is over 800 units lower than the last stardate we were given in ""What's Past is Prologue,"" further indication that the DIS staff are not interested in pretending their stardates make sense.
* We see command trainees running a half-marathon through the corridors. Jean-Luc Picard won the Starfleet Academy marathon.
* The Command Training Program is described as priming candidates for the ultimate goal of promotion to either Captain or Chief. This suggests the program is also for enlisted personnel; the non-commissioned rank of chief petty officer was held by racquetball fan Miles O'Brien.
* L'Rell has taken the role of Klingon Chancellor. The Chancellor presides over the High Council and often summarily decides the Empire's policies. Other Chancellors in the franchise include Gorkon, Azetbur, K'mpec, Gowron, and Martok.
* After a year of seeing bald Klingons, the entire species appears to have grown their hair back. They now better resemble the TNG-era Klingons featured in the other spinoffs. Burnham's line remarking about their hair solidifies the difference in canon (as opposed to a simple aesthetic change we could have ignored)...there is as yet no in-universe explanation for why the Klingons were bald and now aren't.
* A hologram of the D7 battle cruiser is seen. As opposed to the D7 we saw in ""Choose Your Pain"" (see ""Nitpicks"" below), this design is much more faithful to the ship used in TOS.
* Kol'Sha is played by Kenneth Mitchell, who played Kol in the first season.
* The starbase captain teases Pike for ""still communicating on screens."" This is likely a cheeky way to bridge the holographic communication used in DIS with the Skype-style 2D communication used in every other series.
* Spock's medical record is largely unreadable from the perspectives we can view it. I don't see any obvious easter eggs...there is a bunch of boiler-plate ""patient is in good health"" and more stardates that don't make sense. One line is ""Patient insists on forgoing medication,"" while another is ""Patient was brought up in traditional Vulcan household with Vulcan father and Human mother. He experienced no instances of abuse."" The file displays the same few screens over and over until they are replaced by the angel drawings.
* Amanda describes the Sarek family as ""the four of us."" This suggests Sybok was not properly a part of the household, or not there long enough, or that Amanda's not one to talk about her children's estrangement when she's written one of them off herself.
* Tilly's infection by the spore creature is reminiscent of any number of ""crewman is inhabited/infested with alien being/parasite and gets possessed / goes insane"" plots in the franchise.
* L'Rell compares herself and Voq to the love of Kahless and Lukara. The Lady Lukara was Kahless' wife with whom he fought off an entire garrison of enemies; the couple's exploits are honored and reenacted during traditional Klingon weddings, as seen in Worf's and Dax's wedding in ""You Are Cordially Invited.""
* Burnham recounts the story of when she ran away from home, and that she didn't make it past the outskirts of ShiKahr. ShiKahr, established in ""Yesteryear,"" was the Vulcan city where Sarek and his family lived. 
* Spock himself once ""ran away"" when he embarked on his kahs-wan test early, and had to be saved.
* I speculated on this when we were first introduced to Voq, but perhaps it could apply to his son as well: the antagonist in ""Blood Oath"" is an old white-skinned Klingon (or Klingon-esque humanoid) known only as The Albino, who murdered the children of Kang, Koloth and Kor.
* The last time an episode featured a severed baby head was ""Sub Rosa,"" which coincidentally premiered twenty-five years ago today. Don't believe me? You'll have to watch the episode to prove me wrong.

4054,Did anyone else get the feeling tonight... [Georgiou's show],"Did anyone else get the feeling tonight that Section 31 will be Discovery 2.0, where after season 3 it just switches over to the new show with a lot of the old cast as main or reoccurring characters? Especially since they claimed that some of the new shows will be 'replacements' for shows as opposed to running at the same time, which I doubt Lower Decks is replacing Discovery and Picard is coming this year or early next year. 

So far, we've potentially got;

• Georgiou 100% confirmed since it's her show.

• Ash Tyler likely to join up after tonight.

• (prime universe) Lorca possibly returning, since the actor who played him emphasized that *Mirror* Lorca is dead, and said he wasn't allowed to talk about future plans for Lorca.

• Burnham as a potential reoccurring character, due to her relation to Ash Tyler and Georgiou.

It's short, but it says a lot.  (And to the younger people on this sub, before Cracked was a crappy website, it was a Mad Magazine competitor.)

First, it makes fun of the fact that the movie uses subtitles with an alien language to begin with.  This was probably jarring to the typical Star Trek fan the time since no TV episode prior did this. 

Second, they make the Klingon foreheads are a punchline.  Only one Klingon has ridged forehead, and the other one is asking if he has a lobster on his head.  Given that the other Klingon is drawn in a more traditional TOS style, it seems as though they didn't know what to make of it.

Keeping perceptive about the time this was done, the writer and/or artist probably saw the movie once or twice in the theater and (along with some publicity material for reference) had to write a parody based off of initial impressions.  They were probably thinking ""What the hell...?"" when seeing the Klingons and thought that fans would be thinking the same thing.",startrek,1549008708,dougiebgood,23,1,True,2019-02-01
4056,Should I watch TOS next?,"So a few years ago I started my rewatching of Star Trek with Voyager. I had to use a VPN to watch it on the American Netflix, really had to put in an effort and I just was so amazed that it was now possible to watch a complete show online episode after episode. I think that helped in giving me a positive experience with captain Janeway, Tuvok, Tom Paris and the rest of the crew. Tuvix, species 8472, the Kazon and the encounters with the Borg, I just liked it a lot.

After that I started with TNG. The ony show I had already watched multiple times on tv and dvd. But after viewing some clips comparing the dvd quality with the blueray quality I jumped right in. I had never watched the first two seasons, so now I sat down for all the episodes, one after one. It never got better than that. Picard and his crew is the Star Trek I grew up with, fell in love with and I can't wait for him to reprise his role.

When I was a student and got my own room to live in the first night I slept there, was the night that Deep Space 9 premiered on local television in The Netherlands. I watched the pilot with a beer and a cigarette in my room. It never got better than...oh well. During TNG I discovered episode reviews online and I watched DS9 with Jammer's Reviews. I started out positive but ended up being disappointed. The dominating themes of war and religion, multiple episodes about Ferengi. Especially the last few seasons really annoyed me.

It took some time but I decided to dive into Enterprise as well. I stopped watching that series when it was on TV, because I disliked it. But with the 'skip intro' feature of Netflix (I think it was made for ENT) I got ready. And although there really were some weak episodes, and Archer really annoyed me, I actually was pleasantly surprised. Don't know if it was my low expectations, but I was kind of sad that Enterprise ended after 4 seasons.

So here I am now. Ofcourse I'm watching (and enjoying) Discovery, I have saved up some of the TNG-movies and at the moment I'm watching The Travelers to fulfill in my scifi needs. But should I give The Original Series a go? I've never really watched anything of TOS and I think I should at least give it a try. I'm a bit worried it's to outdated to enjoy without any sense of nostalgia. Should I watch from episode 1? Or maybe first try some of the highlights? Is there a list with must-watch TOS-episodes? What are your thoughts?

4058,A stream of consciousness review of the first episode of Discovery's second season. Please discuss it with me!,"So, I'm cheap and haven't watched Discovery until now. I'm kinda familiar with its basics but just barely. S02E01 has been getting good reviews though and because it's free and was assured it was a good standalone, I'm watching it now. I wanted to give some talking points and ask some questions to get a better understanding because even though I've been a fan for 25 years, I've not been super active in the community since around the end of Voyager. Please give feedback on anything I say. I'm looking for conversation.

- The Sarek reinterpretation is nice but still feels super shoehorned. I don't like Spock having a foster sister never even hinted at even if it does fit his story, e.g. Sarek pre-Babel and Sybok pre-Fina Frontier. Those were cheap too.
- The visuals are jaw dropping.  
- Amanda's actor has an amazing warmth. I love her immediately. Is she recurring?
- Is Discovery a testbed like the Intrepid? Or a workhorse like the Excelsior? 
- Sauru is cool. I really dig his gait. It is really good at selling the prey aspect of his race.
- I've never liked the TOS uniforms but dig this redesign. The glib ""but we have new uniforms"" line was enough for me. It made me chuckle.
- I love the awkward command track ensign so much already. She is easily my favorite character so far.
-Is the eyeband the transporter tech wearing a VISOR or transporter equipment? What about the Chief Engineer who is not Scotty's cybernetics? What are those?
-The casual aliens are very appreciated.
-Pike is immediately amazing.
-A gay interracial relationship makes me so happy, especially the casualness of of it. 
- Sarek wants Spock to learn empathy from a human? WHAAA. NO. BACK UP.
- Burnham standing up to Pike when he told her she should offer solutions instead of empty solutions was incredibly satisfying 
- There are a LOT of female characters and it's completely unremarked on. Love it. The Hiawatha engineer was really cool.

CGI and space action scenes is not all that matters, it's good story writing and  the characters that made Star Trek what it is.

4065,"After last night's episode, I'm convinced that Discovery needs to be canceled asap , before it does long lasting damage to Star Trek","My head still hurts from last night's episode, what with the Klingon baby killing (remember when that happened in BSG and everyone was , well this is a dark show , not Star Trek), Section 31 giving out black badges (Jesus save us from their stupidity) , Ash informing Michael that ""the Ferderation should know about this"" , giving her sensitive information on an open channel ... And then we have the Klingons getting hair, but even that was done in the craziest way possible. They shave their heads in war? Really? when did this happen ? Why didn't Gowron shave his head in DS9? I can go on and on like this for hours. 

I think that if discovery is not canceled, it will cause long lasting damage to Star Trek as a brand. I've been a life long Star Trek fan, buying all the merchandise, and rewatching TNG with my son on Netflix right now. But Discovery is not Star Trek. It's a perversion of the brand, a dark, depressing, brooding postmodern nonsense that doesn't understand the spirit of Star Trek. Kind of sad that another show, The Orville, made with a fraction of the budget, gets it much much better. 

I feel sad that some people might need to lose their jobs, that is never a pleasant thing , but better them losing their job than us losing Star Trek.

4077,Idea for a post-TNG era trek: something to continue with Terra Prime,"While the Terra Prime storyline is silly, the premises is extremely realistic.

Quite frankly, even with the communist Russia, modern secular soceity, you still find some kind of traditionalist who refuse to change ways; some who exist in colonies are not even aware of changes, for example some villages in Siberia apparently commemorate Czar even by the time of WWII.

So this got me thinking: I doubt Terra Prime will just completely wipe out, and symapthizers may likely exist. Then there are people who may reject prime directive, and thus will decided to just leave Federation influence, both before and after its formation. These people will gradually be forced to work together, and rejecting primer directive, will take an approach like so: ""All power is given unto us. So go therefore teach all worlds to observe our culture."" (yeah, its bastardized bible quote, but it's possible, and in fact is sadly a corollary)

They will be like a ""perfected Romulan"", in essence. A real counter part against Federation, not the always evil Terra Empire. There may not necessary in open conflict, but possibly terrorism, espionage, and raids. And because they were people of Earth, their openess, which is akin to Imperial Japan and Modern China, will create issue for our main characters as they explore strange new worlds.",startrek,1549040205,Jestersage,1,1,True,2019-02-01

Anyways, did anyone else enjoy the episode?  I did.  Sure, it wasn't last weeks episode, but it wasn't bad.  It set up a lot of stuff.  My curiosity has been interested in the Red Angle even more; especially give we have a bit of a tease into what Burnham might have done to cause the riff between her and Spock (my dad has a theory that whatever effect the Red Angle has on Spock's incident at the psychiatric center is the same efect that caused Burnham to do whatever she did to Spock as a kid).  Amanda is mad at Burnham; I'm glad we didn't have a regular happy-go-lucky, I-forgive-you-for-everything-instantly type of moment.  I'm enjoying all of Pike's dialogue this season, this episode not being any different.

Sure, there were some weak spots.  The Klingon part was a bit confusing only because it seemed like it was only used to set up a bunch of stuff yet to be revealed.  The ""call me mother"" part was a bit strange considering I don't remember a ""mother"" Klingon figure in Star Trek lore.  I wish the spore parasite inside Tilly thing was extended longer.  Have her hide it a deal with it for an episode or two.  Then, we can have her make a massive outburst on the bridge.  It would give it more weight.  The Section 31 bit was ok.  It seemed more like a soft pilot/tease to the Georgiou show coming soon.

I would prefer the episodic approach rater than the serialized! It makes me feel like I have an empty belly in the end of the run.

The things they are choosing to create the missing connection with TOS... Uhmmm, really?
I don't think that giving Klingons hair at this point is enough! Why not embrace the idea that there's other species/races in the Empire that share dominant genes? They could force reproduce with subjugated people... You know, like conquerors. 

The ones that would fit in to their culture the most, in time, would receive the chance to be a part of the ruling cast!

Does it makes sense to you?
It would explain different Klingon looks and overall mannerisms!

On Enterprise show, they explained beautifully the ""human looking"" Klingons of TOS... But they never coved the different species of the Empire!

4092,why the discovery concepts were wasted,"the main premise of the show is futuristic technology, even compared to nemesis-era technology. they can jump through the entire galaxy and apparently forward in time, but because the show got bogged down in trying to have a story arc and forcing in the mirror universe, in both cases tethering the discovery to federation space, they just sort of end up doing stuff that probably would have made more sense as high warp travel in the post nemesis era.

why does the current management of star trek have this obsession with backtracking, rebooting and re-hashing things? at least the hollywood abortion JJ abrahms came up with referenced STENT lovingly and seamlessly, but STD has to shoehorn in a redesigned enterprise?

my point is that if discovery was set in the future from a narrative point of view you could have had jeffrey combs show up as the descendant of shran in charge of the enterprise F, rather than having to recast spock a third time. 

and with that first recast at least it was admitted through the presence of prime spock that it was actually a different universe, but what's with the insistence that STD isn't a soft reboot? at this point it's more like the mess with retelling the same spiderman movie over and over again. 

so really my problem with discovery is the insistence to re-cast iconic characters and to make it a TOS prequel. if they just cast some characters that made sense in the future it would turn out as a better series, and at the same time, in the era of transwarp, spore drive would make total sense.

4097,Tyler/Voq should lead the Klingon Augments in a revolution [Minor DIS Spoilers],"So we have Tyler/Voq, a man caught between the Klingon and human world who is ostracized by most Klingons (and was even before his transformation). &gt;!He is currently believed to be dead by the High Council.!&lt; Then we have a major discrepancy between the DIS Klingons and the TOS Klingons. Then we have a solid explanation for TOS Klingons in ENT - the Klingon Augment virus - which seems to have been left dangling now that DIS Klingons look the way they do.

What if, after the virus was put under control, there was also a split in Klingon society. Unaffected Klingons saw affected Klingons as outcasts/abominations and ostracized them. Perhaps they relocated to a single planet in the Klingon Empire and are treated as second-class citizens. Maybe the story the Empire told to its citizens was that this virus was a creation of the humans, which led to them cutting off contact for 100 years and becoming very xenophobic, leading to T'Kuvma's ""Remain Klingon"" mantra.

So then, let's say Tyler/Voq, unaware of the ostracized Klingons existence, comes across them on their planet &gt;!(possibly under the direction of Section 31, who played a part in the previous Klingon Augment story)!&lt; and really empathizes with their situation. Perhaps among them is a young Kor or Kang, who unlike the elders want to reclaim their rightful place in Klingon society. Reigniting their inherent ""superior ambition"" he leads the Klingon Augments in a civil war against the unaffected Klingons, which ultimately leads to either Augment domination or re-integration. 

Then we have a conclusion to the Klingon Augment story, Tyler/Voq finds a home with similar Klingons, and we connect various plot threads back to established canon. They could even throw in a line about how the Klingon Augments may wish to undergo reconstructive surgery once they have been accepted as part of the Empire.

So CPT Picard wears the TNG uniform with the command red on the bottom and black on the shoulders, but CDR Sisko wears a newer version where the red is on the shoulders and black on the bottom (like in VOY).  

Did Starfleet have regulation for two versions of the uniforms at the time and it was commanders discretion as to which they could wear, or was there a different uniform for a different designation for ""field units"" vs ""support"" personnel? (Or was it like ACUs and Multi-Cams in the US Army, for a while there it was up to the individual to choose?)  

I see Voyager is different in the wiki because ""Costume designer Robert Blackman decided that the uniforms of Voyager's crew would be the same as those on Deep Space Nine."" But I had thought this move was more because of it being an Intrepid class starship vs a Galaxy class (eg; more for scientific discovery than long range/war), but as I trod down that rabbit-hole in my mind, I'm pretty sure I'm thinking too far into this.  I'm also seeing [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_uniforms) that the new uniforms were designed to run in parallel. Is there any reasoning as to why?

4111,[Spoilers] Spock isn't an open book as some may think. (Discovery +),"Every so often I have seen people complain about  how Spock never mentioning Michael before is odd, or doesn't seem to fit the character we all think we know, but is it? 

One doesn't have to delve too deep into things to understand why Spock never mentioned Michael before. In TOS, Spock never told his friends, Kirk and McCoy, who his father was until they were face to face with Sarek on the Enterprise.

Spock never mentioned his Pon Far issue that his own friends knew little about until he was already suffering from it. 

Spock never mentioned Sybok until Kirk and crew were faced with him.

Spock never told Kirk that they were going to head the peace / alliance stuff with the Klingons in STVI until Kirk was told by the Brass and that Spock vouched for them to do it.

In ""Into Darkness"" even that version of Spock didn't even warn Kirk he gave a full report on the Prime Directive fiasco at the start of the movie and Kirk was blindsided by the whole thing. 

And Spock never told Starfleet why he went to Romulus and cut off all communication until Picard and Data were sent there to confront him. 

People like to claim they know everything about the character Spock and get all upset when new things come out of the blue that they never heard of..... But history in Star Trek has shown that Spock keeps his personal details very close to his chest and only mentions any of this when he either has no choice &amp; confronted or it has any sort of relevance to what's happening at the moment.

He never mentions anything unless asked. If you don't know something is an actual ""Thing"" you don't ask it. Seemed nobody bothered to ask if he had a brother. Nobody seemed to ask him at the time when they learned about Sybok whether he had any other siblings and it was left for us to assume that was the only one.

Him vanishing to Romulus, so far, seems to align to him vanishing in Discovery. He sees something that he can help or improve upon and that his actions are logical, yet also believes nobody will understand, so he goes off on his own thing so if something goes wrong, he isn't endangering his friends and crew (needs of the many).

TL:DR

Spock never tells us anything about his personal life or his personal issues until he no longer has a choice. Something he clearly learned from his father.

I remember watching ENT with my gf and she pointed out that pretty much every main cast character was a babe. I think/hope she meant with the exception of Archer and Phlox, but otherwise I couldn't really disagree with her. Aside from Malcom's but-his-face, T'Pol and Hoshi are total babes, and I gotta admit Travis and Trip are pretty hunky.

Then the more I thought about it, the more I noticed that ENT was a lot more sexually changed; all those ""decon chamber"" sequences with them basically oiling each other up comes to mind. TNG had some moments, but none as obvious as that which I can recall; that awkward scene with Lwxana in a mud bath with painted ladies around comes to mind. Seven was obviously ""showcased"" quite a bit, but she seemed to be Voyager's ""token babe"" to me.

I wonder if it's really that they're objectively more sexualized on Enterprise (did anybody on that cast not have a six pack that was shown off at some point?), or was ENT no more sexually charged than the rest, but my subjectiveness about its cast's attractiveness just makes me think so?

We do not see a strong role of artificial intelleigence in human society.  We also do not see modifications to the human body, or a merge of mechanization and biology, which is widely predicted by many futurists now.

We also have no real in-universe addressing of the theory of relativity and the implications to individuals of traveling all over the galaxy at warp speed.

But, it does make sense in terms of Picard's age and the progression of his career.  I'm thinking that he likely took a diplomatic appointment.  We did see in TNG: All Good Things that Picard did become an Ambassador in the alternate future.  Perhaps they're following this path.

However, there's another path that I would be interested in seeing.  A path that sees Picard, out of friendship, loyalty, and some guilt potentially, dedicates himself, even at the expense of his career, to the restoration of Data.  Sort of a similar story line that we saw with T'Pol and Archer in ENT: Twilight.

Regardless of which direction they take, it is my profound hope and desire that the writers and producers will do justice to the characters and the established lore.   ",startrek,1549125009,Wake_Roberts,19,1,True,2019-02-02

So throughout Voyager (and Star Trek in general) there's an emphasis on doing the right thing over immediate gains. Think of the many vs the few. Voyager and its captain had made many sacrifices and also delayed their arrival home on several occasions because of moral principles. And you would think this instilled these values into the crew members, especially young impressionable ones like Harry Kim. But the future him (and surprisingly Chakotay too) just selfishly decides to ignore 15 years worth of galactic history, and turn the time back on it, all to save 150 of his crewmates because survivor's guilt is bothering him, since he couldn't give Voyager the right coordinates for the quantum slipstream thing (which I don't even know why he volunteered so eagerly and confidently to do in the first place; seemed weird since he wasn't a scientist/engineer or expert pilot). I mean think of all the people who's lives depended on those years and events to turn out the way they did; people having marriages, families, kids even existing... you're basically in effect erasing or changing possibly billions of lives. And you know the arrival of an intact Voyager would have made some significant differences, if you think about the ""butterfly effect"" and something as small as a bug possibly changing the course of history. So that whole decision just seemed strange and off, and uncharacteristic for the characters.

And most of all at the end of the episode they almost seemed to act like it was okay or justified, because the show is about Voyager and those are the heroes, so screw everyone else lol. They hinted at possible effects of changing history but mostly kinda brushed it under the rug in the end.

It's also strange considering the efforts they took earlier to stop the Krenim who were also intentionally redoing history in their region for their own benefit.

I get that they were trying to paint the future Harry and Chakotay as changed men who were desperate, crazed, and on a mission, and even adopted criminal lives, but damn. I guess if it works to keep the story going for Voyager, haha.",startrek,1549141214,overling,4,1,True,2019-02-02

But what is space exploration like for non-Starfleet organisations. There are all these other civilizations out in the galaxy, and some of them are just as expansionist as the Federation, even in their methods are different.

However, we only ever see them encounter the weirder hazards of the galaxy in the context of an encounter with a Starfleet crew. Like in 'Day of the Dove', both Kirk's Enterprise, and the Klingons under Kang's command fall prey to an alien entity that feed off their aggression, or in 'The Last Outpost', the Enterprise D and a Ferengi ship encounter a sentient seeming security system left by a long dead alien empire.

Logically we have to assume that the Klingons, Romulans, Dominion, and whomever else you can think of are coming across the same sorts of problems the Starfleet ships, at roughly the same frequency, so how do they handle some of the really weird situations?

While they are outwardly just another alien race with crinkly foreheads and jumpsuits, everything about their culture is so fucking weird that I'd love to know how they end up interacting with the Federation going forward.

This is a race that...

- ...apparently has no understanding of basic emotions and relations, and has to create elaborate scenarios to finally experience them.

- ...survives entirely off of small protein cakes, and does not understand the concept of flavor or eating for pleasure.

- ...are ""born"" as fully grown adults who emerge from pods of some sort; children are an alien concept that they find bewildering and delightful.

- ...conducts diplomacy through fully-committed lying and it actually works pretty well.

I do feel that both strands of the story (""Picard stranded with mysterious woman"" and ""diplomats make shit difficult on the *Enterprise*"") could have stood to be their own episodes.

 I know that DS9's finale ended with people going seperate ways, such as O'Brien and family returning to Earth, Odo returning to the Founders etc, but what about everyone else? 

I personally think much of it would stay the same - O'Brien stays on Earth, Jake stays on DS9 for if his dad returns, if Nog stayed, I think he would have a crack at Engineering or Security. I think Kira would stay only until Bajor became a Federation member, but I suspect Worf could get bored of being the Federation Ambassador. Quark could become more devious knowing Rom gives him leeway. Cant even remember what happened to Bashir, but I reckon he would stay. 

As for Voyager, this is a bit different. We know Janeway becomes an Admiral, but I inagine after being away so long, many of the crew might not want to set foot on a ship again. Voyager would obviously need a refit, but some crew could get re-assigned. I could see Tom and B'E'lanna giving it up to raise their daughter, as both were ex-Starfleet anyway. Harry would definitely stay in Starfleet. Not sure about Chakotay, he also left Starfleet, but with the Maquis wiped out, he could stay, or at least go wherever Seven goes. As for Seven, she has mentioned having enough knowledge to be in Starfleet, so I could see her taking the exam and advancing pretty quickly.

We had D&amp;D v4 but then we got the stellar V5. With Trek, it's been the Abrams approach to Trek since 2009 and it continues with the spiritual successor to it that is DSC. It wouldn't be so bad if the current stewards of Trek actually acknowledged that their approach was light years away form any other show. We are now into season 2. The season after major fan backlash and what have we gotten so far? Recycled characters to somehow make us care about the show (Pike, Spock) and the exact same approach to the show: action instead of thought provoking plot, a season long arc that next to no one cares about and a clear indication that the stewards of current Trek STILL insist on making a show that doesn't have Trek in its DNA, namely a show that explores issues of our time through the lens of a more  evolved version of us exploring the galaxy. 

It's truly disheartening to think that, at this point, we have to assume that those in charge are willfully trying to ram a completely different type of show down our throats. Why? I would assume it's based on some misbegotten conclusion that this is what people want. This is what will bring eyeballs. I think that literally everything is showing that assumption to be flat out wrong, yet they persist in their present course. I really hope that this changes. I really hope that Kurtzman goes to do what he does best somewhere else. He runs an amazing team of artists that make amazing looking sci fi. Let him keep doing that - somewhere else. CBS, reach out to those that worked on Trek in the past. Cherish them. Value what they have to say and give them steering positions. Embrace what came before. Renegotiate whatever TERRIBLE licensing agreements are (possibly) keeping you from making genuine Trek and .... MOVE FORWARD. Forward in time in the Trek Universe and forward in story telling. Instead of taking the characters and settings from Trek and regressing them to a formulaic schlocky sci fi show, take the formula of Trek (See current Orville episodes) and evolve it. BE A LEADER, NOT A FOLLOWER OF FORGETTABLE SCI-FI.  Please do better and be willing to self reflect. What you are doing is BAD for the longevity of your BILLION dollar property. If profit motive doesn't motivate you, then consider the fact that you are producing terrible Trek. If  you love the property, then this alone should move you to make seismic changes.

4201,"[Spoilers] Kirk, Kor, Tilly, Picard, and Kelvin; how it could all come together","Incoming fanboy speculation that will never happen.

Tilly and Kirk are in a command training program.

Tilly could go to the Academy to finish the program - final tests, final semester, that sort of thing. We now that Kirk was at the Academy as a Lieutenant in a teaching capacity, and that Gary Mitchell was a student. 

I think a season where the Discovery undergoes a refit and the principal cast is doing their own thing (Michael teaching, Saru overseeing the refit in preparation to become its captain, Frieza on her way to Earth with King Cold, etc.) would be a good breather after 2 seasons of OH SHIT SPACE IS WHACK!

It's the perfect opportunity to bring in Kirk. Imagine the calm, collected, studious Kirk played off energetic Tilly, Gary Mitchell trying to steer her into him to try to pass. While this fails, we could get the identity of that blonde (whom I have always headcanon'd as Carol Marcus), Tilly could be the one (in this universe) who catches Kirk cheating at the Kobayashi Maru and brings it to the attention of the Academy administrators - Spock or Sarek could be pushing the hammer (or a new character, but Spock would fall in line more with the 2009 version of events, Sarek an acceptable substitute) while Michael advocates for Kirk's ingenuity, breeding drama against Spock or Sarek's position. 

Where does Kor fit into this?

I loved the latest episode, I've always been a sucker for Klingon political drama. The new D7's are about to roll out, the House of Kor just lost TWO heads (pun unintended, but welcome) in less than a year; it is the perfect opportunity for L'Rell to bring the House that opposed T'Kuvma and Mokai close to the chest, to turn the House that wanted to dominate the Empire into the House that champions T'Kuvmaista unity by endorsing Kor and giving him the first D7 with its improved battle cloak (presumably one that allows them to fire while cloaked.) 

In addition, Kor's rise could parallel Kirk's. 

Now, where does the Kelvin timeline and the Picard show come into this?

What if another ship followed Nero and Spock, but ended up in the past, rather than the future? What if Picard appears in the 23rd century for a time before he somehow (slingshot around a sun) goes back to the future?

My question - how would you guys feel about a Section 31 miniseries or a movie? The reason I'm mainly thinking miniseries is because they could show Section 31 at various stages of its development, from the Enterprise  days, to the days of the other series like TOS or TNG, and show how it affected various things, and was affected by the actions of people like Picard, what they were doing around the time of Wolf 359, etc.

Okay now for the real stuff.  


I want it to take place in the 2400's  


The matter replicator is the primary focus of the show. Have it be used for larger scale things, terraforming, summoning weapons and ships without needing to resupply. Just make it the focal point of the series. In my sci-fi universe the matter replicator feeds people without needing to eat real food, it allows people in the military to fight without weapons, and act like they were using magic. It lets (Sanctity Treaty, my stories equal to the Federation) call forth space station and colonies in the blink of an eye.  


I wanna see something like that.   


Have season 1 be exploring the galaxy using this tech, have the tech be explored and show each character and how they live with it.  


Then by the end of that season, I wanna see a new big bad enemy come from outside the galaxy and simply make it so the Federation can't use thier matter replicators anymore.   


the entire federation would collapse, species would form old rivalries and factions. The federation would find itself at the mercy of these other species, and would be the all powerful human nation that has it all.  


races would actually have to learn to work together.  


(I haven't finished DS9, but I know that all the races work together to fight the Dominion)  


Also, I liked discovery episode 2 of the current season. The one directed by Frakes. I wanna see more episodes like that. And NO MORE plot revolving around character from the older series just for nostalgia. Just make it so their names are said or something.

The story is meant showcase a mixture of feelings and sentiments expressed by Seven toward her father as she reflects on the events depicted in Dark Frontier. I know most don't consider Voyager a gem of a series, but I did find Seven of Nine's story particularly compelling.

Song:

Lyrics:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5NfieOv-y5KBS8LOmjrQprVmulO8fVe7lcsota9bRs/edit?usp=sharing

Other than a couple of effects on the vocals, the song is completely unmixed thus far. I didn't want to move on to further writing or mixing without having finalized vocal tracks. I'm very unhappy with the vocal tracks that are there. 

The instrumentation during the intro and outro are place-holders for the time being and will be replaced, I just haven't actually sat down with the keyboard and written anything good for those parts yet. The middle section of the song is a lot heavier than the other parts, straying into melodic death metal and grind. When I wrote it, I wanted that part to sound just as visceral as what I had written in the lyrics. I really wanted to give the impression that what she went through was a very traumatic assault, and I tried to capture the twisted horror of it in words. I wanted to capture the intensity of that with the instrumentation as well. Death metal seemed like the right choice.

The problem I've run into is that I am personally too weak of a vocalist to complete this project alone. I've recorded hundreds of vocalists, and I know weak vocals when I hear them. It saddens me to have to throw myself into that bin, but it is true. I need to find a vocalist who is capable of handling everything other than the death growls. The growls are the only thing I feel don't need to be replaced.

If anyone is interested in contributing vocal talent and helping me complete this project, hit me with a PM and I'll email you the instrumental and a list of tempo/time signature changes so you can build the session in your own DAW. If you use Reaper, I could send you a session template with that stuff already done.

I'm a huge sci-fi fan (which I know sounds weird because I've never seen Star Trek which is the quintessential scifi show), but I just started watching Star Trek recently. I'm only four episodes into the OS (including the unaired pilot). Unfortunately, so far, I really hate it. I really only have two main issues:

1. This is by far the biggest issue. I thought it would be a *sci*-fi show, but so far, every alien they've encountered has magical powers (telekinesis, telepathy, etc). I tend to like more ""hard"" sci-fi and sci-fi that tackles philosophical/existential issues. Does Star Trek continue with these sorts of magical plots? To be honest, even the existence of Spock kind of annoys me because a human-alien hybrid makes literally no sense. Sorry if this comes across as nitpicky

2. The acting is atrocious. That being said, I know that this is probably just because of its time and that it'll get better after the OS.

Normally, the logical thing to do would just be to stop watching it, but I *really* want to like it because of its influence in sci-fi lore. Does it become more ""scifi-y"" in the future?

Neither of these are amongst my favourites, so I haven't selected them in some time. It was nice to have someone else pick my Trek for me.

4236,Discovery extreme camara angles.,"OK. One thing Discovery lacks is constant camera angles that can add something to scene or story. 
The camera always moves 180 degrees or 360 degrees upside down, sideways etc. For a good visaul story telling, your camera shouldnt move always. It is distracting, takes viewer away from scene.

4249,How I would fix these horrible klingons.,"I'm a storyteller. I'll never be a Star Trek writer. I'm just a schlub, but I like stories, and characters, and I really do like Star Trek Discovery, but this last episode was a huge mess. There was no real plot, no structures. I assume they just jammed it in there to bridge some other stuff, but that aside, these klingons are insufferable. Aside from their being generally terrible and dishonorable, the hair doesn't fix anything. I mean, did you see the size of some of those heads?!

Here's what I would do, and I hope they're doing some version of it already.

\--

Ash Tyler goes back to the Federation and finds there's no home for him there either.

He eventually seeks out the augment virus klingons, since they're the closest thing to him. We learn that the klingon empire is caste-like. The great houses are genetically pure, but the empire is full of half-breeds and failed experiments, like the augments, who are basically treated like slave labor. These laborers are currently the ones building the new fleet of advanced D7s. 

As the Great Houses continue their Game of Thrones crap on Q'oNos, their new chancellor finds that there is nothing she can do to stop the war with the Federation from starting up again. The houses are all called to arms, to ritually shave their big huge ridiculous heads, or something, as their new glorious imperial fleet of D7s comes to claim their crews of nobles, and...the augments and half-breeds, under the leadership of Ash, blast them all from orbit. A total Red Wedding. 98% of the Great Houses are vaporized in the attack. 

The classic TOS klingons, under their new Supreme Chancellor, Ash Tyler, is born, and all traces of the old houses are forgotten. And Ash can change his name to Gorkon, or something. Wouldn't that be fun.

And you know what? We just don't see much of them after that. Maybe about as much as we see the Daleks on Doctor Who.

4273,What Star Trek podcasts do you listen to? I've got some thoughts on mine.,"I've been listening to Star Talk for the past few months and so far I've listened to all TNG and I'm all caught up on DS9.  I've had mixed feeling about the podcast but I think I've mostly enjoyed it.

They've done all of TOS and TNG along with their respective movies and are currently making their way through season 2 of DS9, so they've been making these for several years at this point and probably won't stop even after finishing DS9. 

I like the format, the background  information on the production (although I do skip past it when it's just naming off actors I don't know from Casa Blanca) is interesting and adds to the episode; my main issues with the podcast are actually with the hosts. 

I don't remember whose who by heart, but the deeper voice man who does background information and is generally more level headed is rarely the issue. He is definitely my preferred host because he so rarely breaks into unrelated tangents and by far maintains a college head. In fact I can't recall a single time he broke into a tangent or raised his voice over something. 

Now the other host, with the less deep voice, is who I start having issues listening to. He regularly goes into barely related tangents or starts rowing vitriol at groups he dislikes and frankly it makes enjoying the podcast very difficult. Just a few weeks ago on DS9 he went on a long tangent on how much he dislikes the ""never forget"" attitude on 9/11 without explaining what he meant by it. He was making zero sense and I genuinely couldn't understand what he was trying to say other than how it was impossible to forget and that would therefore (?) make the ""never forget"" attitude redundant. This was not the first time he had done this, but was by far the most egregious example to the point of where he himself was admitting that he wasn't making sense but kept going anyway. 

It's gotten especially rough as he's had to transition from the TNG style of Star Trek to the DS9 style. He's looking for episodes that teach the viewer direct messages like in TNG and because he's not finding them he's getting more turbulent, which he has acknowledged and he has been trying to cope. Everything he hates about DS9, the imperfect solutions to imperfect problems, the lack of a black and white good guy/bad guy, the bending of rules, they're all exactly why I love the show and every time an example comes up almost invariably hates it.

The other issue is that the hosts typically agree on the morals, meanings, and messages of each episode which hurts discussion. When they both just agree and move on it leaves the ideas of the episode unexplored and untested by criticism, which is wildly frustrating when you disagree with the episode or with their interpretation. 

I know it sounds like I hate the podcast because of the ridicule I've been throwing at the hosts but it still remains as one of my favorite podcasts in general. They listen to feedback from email/voicemail, genuine discussion does come out when they disagree, and you can tell that even when you disagree with them they're still passionate about what they talk about and about Star Trek.

Despite the latter host and the frustrating episodes, I've been enjoying the podcast for the most part and will probably keep listening until they finish DS9 and maybe pick it back up after they start Enterprise in who knows how many years.

Ships like the Enterprise E certainly could remain in service for more than 20 years but I doubt it would still be a flag-ship. Plus no real fan/show runner would pass up a chance to bring a new Enterprise to the screen.

Do you think it's time to debut, even in passing, to an Enterprise F?

What might it look like? Who might be in command?

Are there other ships that might deserve to be updated?

4276,Theory: Klingon (male) culture as an adaptation for masculinity in contemporary western civilisations.,"It never occurred to me until today when I was having a conversation with some friends over coffee. I was trying to describe characteristics about being male to my girlfriend and a few of her friends, who were missing the point. Now they're just as much a star trek fan as I am and it occurred to me to use the Klingon culture as a way to explain the issue of expressing masculinity to them in the modern day. For some examples: the constant drive to be stronger both physically and mentally, the call to adventure that hits a lot of men from around adolescence and doesn't stop, the enjoyment of testing oneself physically against another person, and so on. It seemed in almost every way, that the Klingon culture acted very similar to how masculinity matures or is very rarely, fairly portrayed anymore in western cultures (it's still there though). Since that conversation, I've wondered whether the writers knew about this seemingly obvious and glass shattering analogy.

4277,New series thought...,"I am excited about the upcoming Picard series.  Discovery got me thinking:

Why do they keep doing prequel stuff?  Enterprise was kind of chained back a bit for being a prequel.  The problem with a prequel is that it can't go crazy with showing us something we already know can't conclude during the series.  Like Discovery has conflict and war with the Klingons... but it can't be concluded in Discovery.  There's value is showing how the war could have almost been concluded earlier I guess, or show escalation points... but can never actually conclude.

So with that in mind: Why haven't they turned back to simply showing the adventures and journeys of another ship that existed at the same time as another?  DS9 was sort of this, with having the Enterprise dock and visit.  Voyager was sort of this, but thrown out on its own.  How about introduce a sister ship to the Enterprise-E and follow that storyline?  A quirk/concern of her captain could be a respectable competition for recognition vs. the exploits of the Enterprise.  Or maybe feature a ship that is more focused on a different mission (Enterprise was exploration), maybe this one could be about science and experiments.  Or if they want to go this route, an actual war ship (not just a small specialist designed one like the Defiant).

I liked it more than most people, but I'm also probably an idiot because I like the new Star Wars more than the originals as well.  But, I really only had one major complaint: the Klingon have no real motivation.  They're just treated as mindless, savage killing machines.  They were actually much more interesting on ""Enterprise"", which I believe came first in the timeline.  I think the show-runners understood that the Borg are always a fan favorite villain and tried to turn the Klingon into an equivalent on Discovery, which I find very frustrating.  The especially annoying part is that they could have solved the entire issue in the first episode with like five seconds of dialogue.  Sarek tells that quite cool story about how after an initial violent confrontation the Vulcans deemed it logical to just fire on every Klingon ship they came across from that point on.  The Vulcans are a founding member of the federation.  This would serve as a perfectly fine excuse for the Klingons feeling like they can in no way trust the Federation.  Not to get all ""kids these days!"", but it seems like a lot of the basic storytelling fundamentals have gone downhill lately in favor of flashy CGI and lots of action, and I find it disappointing.",startrek,1549394321,tweak0,38,1,True,2019-02-05

They didn’t even try to disguise them at all with makeup/prosthetics. It was jarring to see them both, especially in the same episode.

I can only explain what they're missing with a comparison of the movies where they pull off a non-genderless (for lack of a better term) companionship between Kirk, Scotty, bones, Sulu and Spok. 

Other than the Captain, there are no traditional male moulds in the show. And the captain is a rather dull character to be completely honest, devoid of any real depth other than being a template mentor. They either have to be an alien or a homosexual. While there's nothing amiss about either of those characteristics, as the movies still capture the essence I'm on about, the characters in question on discovery are effeminate. It's as if the writers have gone to painstaking lengths to remove masculinity rather than present an acceptable interpretation that is still traditionally masculine. Is it so wrong if male characters are like that? Every other character runs a dualistic style, where they're acting not only as a character, but as a role model for others characters in the show and for the audience watching.

I don't expect half of you to understand what I'm on about. But for those that do, are you wanting stronger male leads as well?

Tl;dr less effeminate male characters, don't care if they're gay or not, just make them more masculine like Worf, Riker or Picard from Next Gen.

4305,Idea for a series that takes place further in the future than previous Treks,"I'm not good with star dates but I'm picturing something significantly post-VOY.

&amp;#x200B;

Star Fleet has a new ship with a crew of AI (the first Star Fleet crew of it's kind). However, these crew members are not copies of each other. They are distinctly different. Some are holograms. Some are androids. Some utilize simple feed-forward neural nets (ie. highly specialized instinct without the capacity to learn from experience) whereas others are capable of modifying or reinforcing their behavior based on negative or positive stimuli. Some are more emotional (ie. like The Doctor) whereas others may be more like Data (although I'd argue that Data's behaviors aren't 100% consistent with what he claims to be. I've never been able to tell if that was intentional). Some of them would obviously have more personality than others.

&amp;#x200B;

Star Fleet decides to experimentally/temporarily exchange 1 crew member from this ship with a human star fleet officer. The human will be a highly decorated officer with an immaculate record. Top scores in every category. A prodigy, but also, with a little bit of an ego. We'll call this character Alex. Anyways, Alex gets the opportunity to serve with the AI crew and is surprised to discover that the ship is not the perfectly efficient machine that would be expected from a crew of digital entities. It could be explained that emotion is actually a useful trait and that when applied intelligently can be a great benefit to the crew. As a major and obvious example, it is helpful with diplomatic encounters to be able to empathize with others. By that same extension, being able to empathize with others is useful for making moral judgment calls.  While Star Fleet does provide them with regulations that are expected to supersede moral judgment, those regulations would not be sufficient to prepare an emotionless AI for all possible situations. This is why it is necessary for some of the AI to experience emotion. As a trade-off for incorporating emotion, there is a calculated and acceptable loss of efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

Alex begins to feel their ego threatened by the general superiority of the rest of the crew. There is nothing that Alex can claim to be the best at. Not making logical decisions. Not even feeling emotion or empathizing with others. Any given skill/talent which is useful to the crew has multiple corresponding AI crew members who are specialized. Alex operates outside of the normal acceptable efficiency for an emotional being on board the ship. Alex requires additional facilities and downtime to maintain normal operation compared to the rest of the crew. The crew notices this and Alex is uncomfortably aware of that fact for multiple episodes as they engage in normal Trek-like encounters with the unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

I have multiple ideas for how it could expand from there. Obviously something needs to happen to shake things up. Ideally something that keeps the crew physically separated from the rest of Star Fleet (ie. captured?) for multiple seasons so they can be forced to prolong the presence of the human officer on the ship. You'd probably be tempted to want to add some kind of twist to make the moral of the overarching story about how the quality of being ""human"" is valuable, even when outmatched in every  conceivable way by the AI. However, I think that would be flawed. It should subtly teach people that being the best is not important and that you shouldn't judge yourself by the standards of others.

Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the character, but I can't imagine some prequel series centered around searching for Riker, or...Odo or something.  Maybe Odo because of his relationship to the changelings, and thus the Dominion.

Spock is not Luke Skywalker.

Is it just that non-fans can most easily recognize him because of the ears?  So CBS is hedging into the idea that new fans will most easily identify with him because they can quickly recognize him?",startrek,1549486493,one_why,16,1,True,2019-02-06

The only solution I can see for this canon violation is doing to it the same thing they did with the Delphic Expanse in ENT, proclaiming it as either evil, or made by the Iconians? Preservers? whatever the red angels are, and it needs to be destroyed to stop them from invading through it.

4340,"S2E3, despite its flaws, was underrated and better than the season premiere.","Yes, the introduction of Pike was cool, but that first episode felt like more over-the-top JJ Abrams-styled action for at least 50 percent of the episode. The pods weaving through asteroids just felt like dumb action for the sake of dumb action, and the CG felt overused. One example that immediately comes to mind is that giant metal pillar falling towards Burnham as she was running away from the starship...so ridiculous and gratuitous!

Meanwhile, EP3 legitimately brought back the more multi-faceted qualities of the Klingon Empire. The writers are very obviously thinking about the Klingon Empire now in terms of ""Game Of Thrones in Space"", and while I would usually balk at that the Klingons have *always* been Game of Thrones In Space, even when RDM was writing them. 

There was so much more interesting character work between L'Rell and Ash, alongside Burnham and Amanda. Tilly's imaginary spore friend felt like a legitimate crisis that even presented itself somewhat ambiguously while the Red Angel's origin actually felt even more complicated and mysterious.

It was very obviously a ""connecting"" episode between one major revelation and another, but other than weird camera work and Section 31 (UGH) it actually got me very invested in what could happen next. Outside of that scene of Klingon fight choreography(which I loved in all honesty) it was very character-driven, without yet another excuse for barely-coherent Abrams-esque CG spectacle.

4342,"Who the hell speaks what specific language, to who and when on TNG and DS9? for those curious","I often see many people wonder what languages the main characters in Each series are most likely speaking to one another and from watching many times you kind of begin to kind of ''just know'' who speaks what and when, even if it's never explicitly stated. 

For starters we know English is the staple language of Earth and is widely used throughout the Federation as a common language.  Many of Earth's diverse languages were no longer in use. This is a result of globalization and the formation of a unified Earth government. 

TNG: 
Picard - Picard is fluent in French, but French by his time is considered an archaic language. So we can readily assume he is speaking English. 

Riker - Riker was born in Alaska, so English as his primary language is near obvious. 

Geordi La Forge - Is Somalian, again Somali as a language is likely archaic by TNG thus, English is the most obvious answer. #

Beverly Crusher - Born on Earth's moon but is of Scottish-American ancestry. So English is an obvious bet. 

Deanna Troi - Seeing as she is half human and half Betazoid, It is likely she is fluent in both her Betazoid tongue and English, seeing how she serves in a human dominant ship, she is likely speaking English to most of the crew. 

Worf - Worf is fluent in Klingon, English and possibly Russian, although as with other languages, Russian is probably Archaic. Due to his human upbringing and his majority crew-mates. It is very likely Worf is speaking English and not Klingonese, although when with others of his kind, it's quite obvious what he is speaking. While Universal translators are a thing, we all still would like to know who is speaking what. 

DATA - English without a doubt. 

DS9: 

Sisko - English

Jake - English

O'Brien - English

Bashir - English 

Odo - Bajoran 

Kira - Bajoran 

Dax - Likely knows and speaks English when on DS9 or with Starfleet personnel, due to many lifespans and knowledge. klingonese when with Worf. 

Quark - Ferengi
Rom - Ferengi
Nog- Ferengi, Possibly knows English due to Starfleet service later on however.

4360,"[Theory] Section 31 could have brought Voyager home using the Mycelial Network, but did not.","Warning: uncovered Spoilers S1 of Discovery, S2 spoilers are masked  


During World War II, Alan Turing and a team of codebreakers unmasked the Enigma machine and began using a formula for when and how to use actionable intelligence to interfere with the war. If there was a strong cover story for acquiring a piece of intelligence, that would mean that the fact enigma had been broken was a relatively safe secret to keep. If it was absolutely necessary, that meant it was worth risking the broken enigma code.   


It is estimated that the actionable intelligence that was safe to use generated by the breaking of the Enigma Code saved 14-21 million lives and shortened the war by 2-4 years.  If the Allies had acted on every piece of intelligence they received instead, Nazi Germany would have reformulated Enigma and forced the Allied codebreakers to start from square one.  


My tinhat theory is that what we are seeing now in ST:Discovery in S1 wherein the ship's propulsion was used to win the Klingon War and in S2 &gt;!wherein the mycelial network is used to allow Discovery to reach distant stellar objects to unravel the mystery of the red angel, !&lt;the Discovery is risking having its' secrets exposed through acting on every opportunity.  We have already seen &gt;!Pike conclude that the Admiralty will give special dispensation to use the spore drive,!&lt; but eventually the admirals will realize that Discovery is the fastest thing in the galaxy: It must be maintained as a strategic superweapon. Likely it will end up in the hands of Section 31.  


So, more than one hundred years later when Voyagers is known to have disappeared into the Delta Quadrant and Section 31 has the ability to bring them home,  doing so would require explanation. It would be a high-profile story every federation member, ally, and enemy would hear of: The risk of losing the advantages of the Mycelial Network would be too great, with relatively non-existent strategic benefit.   


Thus Starfleet allowed Voyager (and the Equinox) to become lost in deep space with nary a hope of making it home before most of the crew reached retirement age or died. ",startrek,1549569617,sdneidich,33,1,True,2019-02-07

When she was killed by that monster Armus I was PISSED! Not because she died, most TV shows have characters who meet an unfortunate end, but because of the way she died. I felt that the writers were mad at Denise Crosby for wanting to leave the show and punished her by giving her a “meaningless death”. There was no final moment of courage, no tragic beauty, the way she was killed was practically devoid of emotion, her death did not accomplish anything. I really like Tasha and would have loved to see her die in a more beautiful way, perhaps sacrificing herself to save the Enterprise and it’s crew, her only family. Hell even if she was killed by Armus it should have been more meaningful, more poetic, but it was crude. Do you think the writers should have given her a more noble or meaningful death? even Jadzia’s death on DS9 was better than hers, although her death was also meaningless. Both actresses wanted to quit the show, is it possible the writers were angry at them and therefore gave them quick and brutal deaths? Terry Farrell even said that she wanted to stay on as a recurring character but was told that if she left the main cast that her character would have to die.

4364,How Worf Developed Under Two COs,"Currently rewatching First Contact, with a fresh repeat viewing of DS9 ending only a few weeks ago and Generations just last night. It's obvious to see the difference in Worf from his time on the 1701-D to DS9 then 1701-E.

Worf's demeanor and comfort in commanding the Enterprise's bridge in Picard's absence for the brief amount of time is a definite carry-over from his time in the Defiant's chair. What really struck me was how he didn't hesitate to question Jean-Luc's decision to fight off the Borg over abandoning ship. Now this is just my assumption, but I don't think the pre-DS9 Worf would have ever make the threat to kill Picard where he stood.

So maybe the answer is obvious, but whom did Worf develop and benefit more under, Picard or Sisko? Also, to who does he have a better relationship with?",startrek,1546309343,TheNakedChair,20,1,True,2018-12-31

4370,"Alright, you guys were all right about DS9...","Everyone told me ""Great Trek"" some were even so bold as to say ""Best Trek"" to which I replied with skepticism. I got 2 and a half seasons into this show and still couldn't stand it. I had resigned myself to just always being the contrary opinion.

But a favorite podcast of mine started DS9 in the past year, so I put away my grimace and soldiered on, and wow, JUST *WOW.* 

While I still think I'll always be a TNG boy, this show surprised the hell out of me. I'd heard a lot about the Dominion War and how epic it was, but no amount of nerd posturing could prepare me for the sheer scale of it all. It was fascinating to see how a society so far removed from the need for violence or fighting responded to the true horrors of war. This thing is tough, it's dirty, bloody, and desperate, and for so long. I've never seen characters go through so much hardship on a Star Trek show, and never had I felt so vulnerable, so fearful for my favorite characters to make it out of the scrap. I'm just gonna gush for a minute over some highlights, but first I wanted to say that this show has done amazing things with Character Development. The way this show builds its characters is at a level I haven't really seen in other Trek shows. It turns hapless romantics into grizzled war-heroes, and we see several children become complex and interesting adults.

Jake Sisko is Awesome. I love how supportive Benjamin is of his son seeking a career that's not in Starfleet. He starts as a little lovesick kid hanging out with Nog on the Promenade, and by the end he's a reporter, he's seen battle, and he is a published novelist. And *NOG,* a character that I couldn't stand in seasons 1-2, would become one of my favorite characters. The episode where Vick helps him through his PTSD is a highlight for me.

I even liked Julian when it was all said and done. Dukat was a truly hair-raising villain, and it was interesting to see Dukat really come to ""Walter White"" terms with how much of a monster he is. Never have I seen a villain get so much character building, while still remaining so profoundly evil. That seen with Him and Sisko in the cave is terrific.

The retaking of DS9 was so awesome. I haven't been that satisfied over a plot resolution since I saw the Stark flag return to Winterfell. It's an apt comparison. This show begins like a quirky slice-of-life in space with shitty 90's-era romantic tropes and mild sexism, and goes out like Game of Thrones. I thought Worf got arguably more to do here in DS9, and his character was a welcome familiar face that wasn't wasted. I also loved how the humans and Klingons really bonded quite heavily in the face of possible annihilation.

Anyway, I could go on and on, but everyone who told me to stick it out was right, and I fucking love this show.

I figure eventually, after the reduction of tensions between the Federation and the Klingon Empire after Enterprise C intervened at Narendra III, Starfleet wants to get back to their exploration/adventure/science mission and part of that is a return to division colours.

But for a long while everyone is use to the Captain wearing red, so they switch red and gold, and keep command division red, move back to blue for science and gold for engineering/operation, while keeping the same naval design Kirk was rocking for 6 movies.

But that design quickly falls out of fashion in the newly reinvigorated science based Starfleet. And so the shift to the TNG uniforms we all know begins!

4391,2019 is going to be a fun year for Star Trek fans!,"First off, happy New Year to everyone!

But I was thinking about this the other day that from this month on we are going to be inundated with Star Trek for most of the year! We are going to get constant news and actual content from this point on we haven't gotten in a long time with two Star Trek shows to look forward to and Short Treks continuing. 

Starting in just a few days we get our last Short Treks and then two weeks later season 2 of Discovery officially begins! And AFAIK we won't get any breaks, so we will go three months straight so there will be something weekly to discuss. And then whats crazy is it will end in April which is supposedly when the Picard show goes into production! So I imagine we are going to get TONS of news about that show while Discovery is on, certainly casting and background.

I'm guessing when Discovery finishes season 2, we will get a few months off before they start up the Short Trek series again. Just speculation but I imagine those will begin sometime in the summer and will probably have at least four like these did. And we can't discount  one or two of those stories could be a prelude to the Picard show of some kind. Not saying it will but what better way to get hype started for that show by doing a side story in that era even without Picard before the show starts. 

And then those will lead into the Picard show which we know will start at the end of this year. I'm guessing if the show starts filming in April then it could actually premiere in September or October. But my guess is it will most likely be November. It's clear though CBS want this show on ASAP so I'm guessing it will happen sometime in the Fall at least. And my only guess is Discovery will be shooting season 3 by the time that starts if season 2 is anything to go on so another season could start just a few months after the Picard show is done. And who knows when Lower Decks will start but we will probably get news about that this year as well.

And while sadly the movie side of Trek is looking down and out these days, who knows, we may still get an announcement of the fourth Kelvin film. To me, I think it will either be announced this year or they will move on. They can still get another out by 2020 if they start sometime this year, but that will still be four years since Beyond came out. Five years at this point may just feel a little too long but who knows. If they do get their stuff together (ie pay Pine what he wants) then we could discussing a new film this year as well.

This could be a really great year and the start of Trek being on constantly for years to come. To have two shows in one year is starting to feel like old times. I'm really excited about everything that is coming and these boards are going to be buzzing with activity all year.

4392,if the mirror universe's origin was shown in TOS.,"Kirk, McCoy, Uhura, and Scotty looking into the ISS Enterprise's computer archives, and then seeing that WW3 in the mirror universe was an alien invasion that in later instalments would preclude the arrival of the Vulcans in ""First Contact"". The archival footage they would see would be footage from George Pal's ""War of the Worlds"", specifically the [Battle with the martians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5H4yK_tiGI), [The attempt to destroy the Martians with Nuclear weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29Zit2PwF4) and the [martians destroying los angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zirz-BSLeCo).

It is after seeing this that kirk comes to the conclusion that in this universe, as a result of the invasion, humanity became even more fearful about their mortality and were nonetheless traumatized by this event. The invasion negatively impacted their perception of extraterrestrial life and caused them to develop a xenophobic view of alien life. When they did set off to the stars, they did so out of vengeance and to destroy the conquerors that harmed their race as well as destroy or subjugate any alien civilization that may prove to be a threat to Humanity later on. In doing som humanity became the conquerors themselves as self preservation eventually gave way to conquest and the need for living space (or lebensraum).

DIS: fuck it, they ARE space pigs. Let's make them badass space boars and try to make THAT look cool.

You can see that while DIS Andorians are a tweaked version of the ENT design, the Tellarites on ENT and DIS are both follow-ups to the original TOS design that interpret it differently.

4408,Lore videos vs just recapping the story,"I've been checking out a few star trek related channels and I've noticed an increase in videos calling themselves ""lore"" or a ""review"" but they are just giving a synopsis with a few jokes.  I know CBS is strict with their IP but when you just retell what happens how is that trans formative?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong there are people giving good episode analysis out there with insight into the filming, the writing, behind the scenes stuff or just having fun with things like the video on how many torpedoes Voyager had but if I'm just telling you the highlights of the dominion war it really feels like you are replacing the source.  If you like the show watch the show, watching a 30 minute video to save you from watching a 45 minute episode seems silly.   

&amp;#x200B;

On this same topic do you think it diminishes or changes the meaning of the show? If you do a ""lore"" video on a fight when the fight was a byproduct of an overall story do you see that as a good thing? For example if you really like fighting and did a hobbit vs hobbit combat breakdown for Gollum and Frodo at the end of Return of the King does that make sense?  Is it ignoring too much of the story?  Or movies mean different things, everything is fine so who cares?  ",startrek,1546445638,Tnetennba7,3,1,True,2019-01-02

4410,Potentially unpopular opinion: Jadzia Dax is a boring character,"#ONLY ON SEASON 3 OF DS9, NO SPOILERS PLEASE

I don't really know what the general feeling is, but I have a feeling this is going to be unpopular. Also, maybe she gets better later on. But anyway, at this point, I find Jadzia to be a really dull character.

She seems like she'd actually be a really fun person to know and hang out with in real life, but for the exact same reason, she's really boring on TV. She's basically an emotional Mary Sue. She's comfortable in *every* social situation, she can talk to anyone, she has basically no prejudices of any kind, and she can charm the lobes off a Ferengi. She has basically *no* flaws.

Even Picard, *Star Trek*'s perfect man, had flaws, especially in the social department. He was often stiff and stuffy, and his high-brow interests clashed with the rest of the crew. He never sat down to play poker with them, and his idea of a relaxing vacation is attending a lecture on astrophysics. This is part of what makes the Holodeck and Risa episodes so much fun: they're just in-character enough to stay believable, but out-of-character enough to be interesting.

Jadzia is at home anywhere. She'd be completely at home playing poker and screwing everything that moves on Risa, but she'd also enjoy going to Picard's conferences and reading 500-year-old literature. Consequently, we never really get to see her socially or intellectually challenged.

*Deep Space Nine* puts a heavy focus on the interactions between the characters. One of the most interesting things about Sisko is his slow progression towards truly *believing* the ideals he thinks he already does. At the start of the show, Sisko is an idealistic Federation officer, who talks big talk about ""seeking out new life and new civilizations,"" but actually harbors a lot of internal prejudices without realizing it. He practically despises the Ferengi (to be fair, you probably shouldn't trust a lot of them, but he takes it *way* too far and never gives Nog a chance), and tries to stop Jake from associating with them.

Jadzia never takes issue with *anything*. She seems unfazed and even flattered when Quark gets suggestive (sometimes even hands-y). She never complains about Bashir's constant flirting (which, by the way, is *completely* inappropriate between two colleagues on the clock in a professional setting). She''ll eat anything. This total lack of any conflict *ever* makes for really boring stories.

Picard also has the flaws of his past. There are multiple episodes in which Picard must face the consequences of his actions on the Stargazer or in his youth, demonstrating character growth and giving us deeper insight into the man he is on the *Enterprise.* 

Jadzia's only interesting episodes—and, to her credit, they are quite interesting—are when she's forced to face the consequences of her past lives (the one with the Albino Klingon and the one with the suppressed psycho-killer, for example). The problem is, the show makes *very* clear in those episodes that Jadzia and Curzon are two different characters. They have shared memories, and the symbiote connects them, but Jadzia is NOT Curzon, so they're not really *her* flaws. At least, not in the same way that Picard's past flaws are.

**TL;DR: She's a flawless character with no strong dislikes who's open to anything and never gets put in uncomfortable social situations, which makes her totally boring in a show that puts a lot of focus on personal interactions.**",startrek,1546449571,UnderPressureVS,8,1,True,2019-01-02

The problem is, I'm 35 and I've been watching Star Trek in some form or another since I was about 6 or 7, and frankly, I don't know what would be a good start for her.  The expectations for entertainment in the late 80's was a bit different than now.

&amp;#x200B;

She likes Marvel movies and Star Wars and Harry Potter, but also enjoys a good book.  She just finished a fiction book set during the struggle and horror of the Jewish holocaust and couldn't stop praising it.  The pieces are there in her mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like as far as entertainment it's better to start with more recent stuff, but as far as substance it's better to start much, much further back.

I like all of them in different ways:

1. Archer because he's willing to call out the Vulcans, but he still sees them as people at the end of the day. He can be reckless at times, but is heart is in the right place. I am only on season 2, so maybe my feelings towards him will change.
2. Kirk because he's smart, but he doesn't feel the need to brag about it. For example, he has won against Spock in chess [\[1\]](https://ytcropper.com/cropped/hE5c2d3766b1146). He may not have the refined skills of Picard, but again the Federation is still pretty new (TOS 5 year mission: 2207 - 2212). 
3. Picard because he sees the good in everyone even when he's taken captive by the Cardassians [\[2\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3EDTYZTOU). He is still willing to accept Hugh despite what happened between him and the Borg. Plus his speeches are top notch.
4. Sisko because he's open minded towards other faiths. I don't like how preachy it gets towards the end, but he is a great commander. I feel like he is a lot like Malcolm X and Picard is a lot like Martin Luther King Jr because Sisko is willing to do whatever it takes to preserve the Federation.
5. Janeway because she knew how to be a mother to Seven of Nine. She made the Voyager crew and the Maquis become a family. I do think the change was too quick, but I admire how hard she worked. Also, she treated the Doctor with respect and even allowed him to take command in emergencies.

Things I don't like about them

1. Archer distrusts the Vulcans a lot, but I can understand his reasons.
2. Kirk has done many stupid things through out the Original Series and the Movies that have had negative consequences.
3. Picard is sort of boring, but that's more of the setting of TNG, and not his fault.
4. Sisko is a great captain, but I do disapprove of some of his methods to get there
5. The whole plot of Endgame sort of soured captain Janeway for me.

I know TNG missed the mark with the Ferengi early and played them for comedic effect later, and that they didn't really reach their potential until DS9, but I'd still like to have an episode or two on hand just for completion's sake.

And it doesn't have to stop there it could also show past events that where only mentioned in the show.  Like for instance the Battle of Prexnak with the ten Ferengi standing up to 73 Lytasians or even the Hur'q invasion on Qo'noS(I could see that being a 2 or even a 3 parter).

Erzi Dax may just be my favourite character in all of trek, I think because there is just enough time given to her to fall in love with the character but then it’s over.

Now let's play back Odo's runabout request to Sisko ""One of the Bajoran science probes recently scanned a planet about 6 light years from the wormhole and it picked up some very unique -- and familiar -- DNA patterns....""

The science probe indicated DNA, no one said anything about it being uninhabited, or anything else that might indicate that life no longer exists. THEY EVEN FOUND A THING THAT WAS ALIVE WHILE THEY WERE THERE.
 
 
Could someone explain how this isn't a breaking of the prime directive, or if it is, why does no one seem to care, or at least seem potentially worried about it?

So how does this come to be? I think logically the Federation has to have a much bigger economy than any of these, since they don't spend most of their money on wars. They should also outrank the other 3 in terms of population, since they are multi-racial, while the Romulans and Cardassians at least seem to go against minorities in their empire. The Federation simply doesn't lose chunks of their population to famines, genocides or secret police killing their own citizens. Also, while the Federation doesn't accept everyone, there seem to be a lot of planets that want to join them voluntarily and these planets are sometimes 200 years behind in technology (only technological requirement is to have warp-drive, which humans discovered 200 years ago), so the Federation brings way more advanced technology to these planets, which should result in huge population booms and thus more people for the federation. Lastly the Federation doesn't have to deal with rebels like the Cadassians do on Bajor, since they are much more accepting. So my point is that all of these other powers logically shouldn't hold a candle to the Federation in anything except military, especially the Klingons, who should not even have made it into space with the state their society is in.

It is a problem. I'm sure everyone is by now well-versed in the ENTIRELY metaphorical language used by the race know as the Tamarians. Well-versed in how this language is abso-fucking-lutely ridiculous and would never actually work in reality.

I think it can. I think I have solved the problem of how this kind of language could form and develop.

Memes.

Now hold on, I know, ""this isn't r/shittydaystrom"". I'm not joking, I'm completely serious. Our culture is producing memes at a rate that has never been before seen in history. We have Bad Luck Brian, Scumbag Steve, Pepe, Socially Awkward Awesome Penguin, and so one. Your average internet user knows and recognizes the meaning of a fairly ridiculous number of memes, free of context or even captions. You find the right two people and there can be entire conversations that are little more than memes shared back and forth. The Tamarian civilization, to me, represents the potential outcome of a culture that has taken this meme-based communication to the absolute limit.

&gt;1. A series set at Starfleet Academy from  creators Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz. The duo most recently  developed the CW’s reboot of “Dynasty” and previously created shows like  “Gossip Girl” and Hulu and Marvel’s “Runaways.”  
 ***2. A limited series whose plot details are being kept under wraps.***  
 3. A limited series based around the “Wrath  of Khan” story. Khan’s full name is Khan Noonien Singh. He was famously  portrayed by Ricardo Montalbán in both the original series episode  “Space Seed” and again in the film “Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.”  Benedict Cumberbatch then played the character in the 2013 film “Star  Trek Into Darkness.”  
 4. An animated series whose plot details are being kept under wraps.

This was seemingly confirmed back in October when CBS trademarked 6 new Trek shows

[https://comicbook.com/startrek/2018/10/25/star-trek-new-tv-series-rumor-trademarks-cbs/](https://comicbook.com/startrek/2018/10/25/star-trek-new-tv-series-rumor-trademarks-cbs/)

At the same time as the original rumor announcement, this came out(linked to in the first link)

&gt; There are no specifics about any of the projects at the moment though **there is talk that one of the first shows would be an eight-episode limited series spinoff**. Kurtzman and Co. may reveal some details at the upcoming Comic-Com convention. 

The only two series described as ""limited"" were the Khan series, and the, unknown project we later found out to be the Picard show.

Now back in December, Alex Kurtzman said this

[https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/10/star-trek-picard-series-different/](https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/10/star-trek-picard-series-different/)

&gt; Only Stewart has been cast in the spin-off so far, Kurtzman added. ***“The  writers’ room has broken about eight episodes*** and we’re moving quickly,  and I couldn’t be more excited about it,” 

Only the Picard and Khan series were described as limited, and one of them was described as being 8 episodes, and we know from what  Nicholas Meyer has said that Khan was only three episodes, and we have this same ""8 episodes"" thing being mentioned by Kurtzman.

So when it comes time to repair it, Data decided he wants his appearance to be a bit older, to reflect how much he has grown as a being.  He decided he wants to look as aged as a regular human would be. Aprox 20 years older then he looked in Nemesis. 

2. At some point before St:Picard Data began appearance began to age.  Upon investigation it is discovered,  Dr. Soong made aging part of his design.  And from time to time Data begins to “age” in appearance to fit in better with humans.

3. After the events of ST: First contact.  Someone,  cracks how the Borg gave Data real human skin. Before the events of ST:Picard data’s whole body is covered with real skin.  However the real skin ages as it would on a normal person.

___

**Short Trek 4 - The Escape Artist**

* Tellarites last appeared in the Mirror Universe in DIS S1 (one was played by Harry Judge, who plays Krit here); they also featured in ENT S4 (and before that, another Tellarite bounty hunter appeared in ""Bounty""). To date, no Tellarites have been seen in the TNG era. Krit appears to honor the stereotype of Tellarite stubbornness.
* The ""real"" Mudd's female bounty hunter costume is vaguely reminiscent of the Breen environmental suit, which is itself more than vaguely reminiscent of Leia's bounty hunter costume in Return of the Jedi.
* ""Cudgel"" is an archaic but real name for a club or bat. Presumably the term is being translated from the equivalent Tellarite word, which begs the question of why the translator picked ""cudgel"" from all the possible synonyms.
* Krit recites Mudd's rap sheet. It includes smuggling and transporting stolen goods. Both charges were among the crimes listed in the rap sheet seen in ""Mudd's Women."" The original record did not include ""regicide.""
* The two most common forms of currency in the Trek world -- the credit and latinum -- are both mentioned.
* Mudd complains about the ""Federation taxman."" This is the first-ever indication that taxes exist within the Federation, a society whose citizens have repeatedly claimed doesn't use money. This could simply be a figure of speech (he's probably not *lying*, since the Tellarite would himself be a Federation citizen and fully aware of how things work), or perhaps there are indeed some form of ""taxes"" levied against citizens who earn a profit in some way. It could also be the case that there is still money and taxes in this era and that the new world economy is still on its way (it's definitely in place by the 2280s).
* The power struggle between the Orions may be a reference to the fact that Orion women are secretly in charge of the men.
* One of the Mudd androids is wearing a frock coat, which the real Mudd was seen to sport in TOS and TAS.
* The fact that Mudd has a ship full of androids seems to suggest that this episode takes place after ""I, Mudd."" In ""Mudd's Passion"" he explains that he ""borrowed"" a ship to escape the android planet; he may have been able to create copies of himself for this scheme. Whether this episode takes place before or after ""Mudd's Passion"" is unknown. If all of this is true, it suggests the DIS-era Starfleet uniforms remain in use during the TOS era.
* Among the artifacts strewn about Mudd's bridge are the ""Andorian"" space helmet from ""Music to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad,"" the *Mona Lisa*, a Nataraja sculpture, and other objects which probably have significance. It should be noted that the *Mona Lisa* was later seen in the possession of another unscrupulous cad, Kivas Fajo, in ""The Most Toys.""",startrek,1546581826,Antithesys,12,1,True,2019-01-04

I don't see how this situation is any different than if say, the Borg were holding two of her officers and demanded she murder a third to get them back. The third person wouldn't even have to be a member of her crew...it could be some random member of some alien race that she never met in person, and it would still be inconceivable for Janeway or any Starfleet officer to kill an innocent person to save two others. What's even more disturbing is how she basically berated Tuvix after he said it wasn't her decision to sacrifice his life...she tried to guilt him into committing suicide to save two people who were effectively dead.

4489,Datalore (TNG S1E13): What's the story with the crew's treatment of Lore at the end,"So Lore is obviously a bad dude in his current state, that's pretty obvious given the facilitation of the destruction of the Omicron Theta colony and the attempt to also help the Crystalline Entity eradicate the Enterprise.

The way ultimately Picard handles Lore at the end of the episode seems a bit extreme though.

To kick it off, after Lore's failed ruse to masquerade as Data is revealed, it ends up with Lore being thrown onto the transporter pad. At this point Wesley activates the transporter and beams Lore ""somewhere"" (it's never actually mentioned at that point where he went).

At no point does anybody tell Wesley where to beam Lore, so apparently Wesley makes the decision himself to just send Lore out into space.

Following this, after realizing Lore has been beamed out into space Picard makes a comment about Data changing his uniform and continues on a course to get the Enterprise computer refit.

Why would Wes not beam him into the Brig or something, why send him out into space? I'm assuming we could chalk this up to Lore being extremely dangerous and Wes needing to act quickly.

But, the real question is if Data is indeed considered a sentient being, then Lore would be as well - Picard just knowingly leaves Lore out there like they beamed some trash off the ship and apparently nobody cares.

According to future episodes, Lore simply drifted in space for years until being rescued by a Pakled ship.

If Lore was so dangerous wasn't Picard being pretty negligent just leaving him like that, not to mention slightly inhumane. Couldn't they have recovered him from space in a disabled fashion and taken him to a star fleet research station or something?

At the very least they could have sent another ship to recover him later.",startrek,1546622076,dr1zzzt,7,1,True,2019-01-04

4512,Question about Star Trek Voyager,"So, I'm a huge fan of Star Trek TNG which is the show I grew up with. I was a bit older when I caught TOS and also loved it, but couldn't get into DS9. I'm currently giving Voyager a shot and I must say, the first episodes of the were difficult but I got on board season 2 and I absolutely loved the second half of it, but now I'm on season 3. I had a hard time enjoying ""Remember"" and ""Sacred Ground"" and now I'm on Future's End and I'm actually hating it.

Spoilers ahead

I just can't accept that a hippie was able to not only understand but master 29th century technology and outsmart the engineers of Voyager in the process. Or have the Doctor walk around after B'Elanna and Harry failing to do so during the whole show so far. Or the fact the bad guy could stole the EMH that is said to be several petabytes in a matter of seconds and also master that technology to make him feel pain in a matter of hours. A 1996 office computer with 3000 gigabytes was also weird, and the Voyager being able to casually tap into top secret US Military communication was... sort of unlikely.
And then there's the whole plot with farmers being so hostile to federal that are ready to go up in arms against them Waco style. Or a trailer truck with a tire blown up able to turn around and try to ram a van at full speed. There's also how everyone in this episode, both the Voyager crew and the bad guy is terribly condescending towards Silverman's character like she is a dumb girl and not an astrophysicist.

I'm very bitter about this because I was falling in love for this show really hard. Does it get any better? I'm also aware this episode is apparently a fan favorite, which I just can't understand but I do respect it, so please don't think I'm trolling here.

4518,3d printing a set of all or most of the ships to bear the name Enterprise.,"Hey guys, first post on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been diving into the world of 3d printing combined with our CNC machine and metal casting and as a side project to bolster my skills and understanding i'm 3d printing, painting, and making custom decals for the...

&amp;#x200B;

HMS Enterprize

USS Enterprise CV65

Space Shuttle OV-101

XCV-330

NX-01

NX-01 Refit

NCC-1701, A, B, C, D, E, and F

&amp;#x200B;

I have a J model but it will be too massive for a display case that I plan to put these all in.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing this at 1/2067th scale. I arrived at this scale not so deliberately, it just happens to be the smallest size I can print the space shuttle and HMS Enterprize at where they are still recognizable and able to be painted and still have them be to scale with the rest of the ships. I could make them off scale but I personally think its really cool to set the Shuttle on the Saucer of the 1701 and marvel at the size difference.  
I'm going to eventually mount them all on a backer that can mount to the wall with them all in a line with registry number plaques, probably black painted brass and then ill use the CNC machine for the lettering. Then a plaque on the bottom that probably says ""Fate. It protects fools, small children, and ships named Enterprise."" but i'm not totally sure yet. I'm happy to hear suggestions.  


So far I have the shuttle, NX-01, 1701, and 1701 A printed. The NX-01 Refit is on the printer right now and my brother painted up the shuttle with booster rockets and tank, but the eventual OV-101 that goes in the case will be mounted on a 1/2067th scale 747.   


In hindsight I  probably could of made them all 1/2063rd scale to coincide with Cochrans first warp jump in 2063 but I've already printed quite a bit.  


For the small details i'm printing decals on water slide decal paper, sealing them with clear coat, and applying them to the models then clear coating the models.   


Let me know what you think! Ill post again when its done in a month or so god willing haha.

Just as enjoyable however is the campy acting and makeup at times. I. Saying that, there is an amazing amount of great acting scenes. And I can totally understand why Spock was such a hit.

Why always officers pilot the Defiant which aren't a helmsman or better have it primary specialisation.

4526,What is Star Trek: Discovery? (Season 1 Spoilers),"This seems like an odd question for a show that I watched an entire season of. But I did see some promotional material for season 2, and I'm even more confused.

Here's a Time Magazine quote from 2017:

&gt;Though *Discovery* has a distinctly different look than the original *Star Trek* series — the uniforms have changed as have the look of the Klingons — the writers say all the discrepancies between *Discovery* and the original show will be explained.

[http://time.com/4952491/star-trek-discovery-timeline/](http://time.com/4952491/star-trek-discovery-timeline/)

First off, the uniforms and the look of the Klingons are the least of my concerns. But what exactly in season 1 explained the wildly different universe it takes place in? Is it because they were some kind of Black Ops ship in a delicate situation, far away from the otherwise utopia of the federation (even though earth was nearly destroyed)? Is it because the crossover business with the mirror universe? Or better yet, did the mirror universe cause another split in the timeline that I missed?

Seriously though, I could have missed an explanation. I binged season 1 fairly quickly because I didn't want to pay for more than a month of All Access. I might rewatch it after get it again for season 2, when it is over.

*(I'm mostly just ranting after this, if you want to speak to anything above and skip it.)*

Now with the season 2 material that I've seen. We have the Enterprise, Captain Pike, Spock... it just seems to be impossible to maintain the illusion that this show is taking place before TOS.

I just keep thinking, if they wanted to make a Star Trek show that is so vastly different than previous shows, why didn't they just have it take place 100 years after Voyager? I mean, I can't speak for everyone, but that's certainly what I've been waiting for since Voyager. I just want them to make the ""Next Next Generation"" (for lack of a better title).

That's the only redeeming factor to the other series they announced with Patrick Stewart, at least it takes place after Voyager. But they don't want it to take place *too* far after.

Each new Captain could be an excuse to tackle Trek from many angles. On the other hand, another side of me really wants Discovery to settle with Saru as Captain.

4529,Could you count the events of Star Trek Online as Canon?,"I'm asking here because I've looked online and some sources say it is, some say it isn't, and others say that some of it could be counted as true while other parts not. So in other words there's lots of confusion over it.

Personally, I'd count it as part of Canon because I like many of the plot points and storylines within the game, and it uses and develops upon quite a few plot points from all the series and eventually ties them all together, something that I really like about it.

So I won't go through all the storylines in-game but I'll just go though a couple to get my point across:
My first one's going to have to be the whole idea of the Romulan Republic. I personally really like the idea that Spock's underground movement eventually succeeded and became a major 'rallying' point for the disjointed Romulan people after the destruction of Romulus (and we know this happened in Canon as it is), and then set on a journey for a new homeworld with the Empire on the hunt for them because of their more open ideology (because to me it seems like that would actually happen). 
My second one I think would be the Iconions. So we know they existed and we know their homeworld was destroyed after a rebellion, and we also know that it was theorised they escaped. This storyline I feel ties in very nicely with everything else that happens in (and out of) game. So the Iconions wanted revenge after the quadrant turned against them, and they did so covertly for thousands of years (after the slow rebuilding of their society in uncharted space) by influencing other civilisations and manipulating their fates - such as causing the unexplainable, and sudden Hobos supernova which considerably disrupted and disjointed power in the Alpha Quadrant and sent it into complete disarray (perfect for an invasion which they eventually did a decade later) - to me its a very interesting storyline and, as I said before, ties up a few loose ends from the other Canon.

4531,An Idea to address the complaint that we never see modern media representation in Star Trek,"While letting my mind wander as I watch a typically boring holodeck episode, I was thinking about a complaint I hear often that it doesn't make any sense we don't see any music or holodeck simulations or anything really representative of anything after the early 20th century.  I remembered that in the Star Trek timeline Earth and human society is ripped apart by the ""eugenics wars"" which lead into world war 3, and the idea of eugenics gained strength in WW2, an obviously crucial part of history, and I was thinking that to a person hundreds of years in the future they may just think of the period between say 1935 and 2035 as ""the war period"" starting with WW2 and ending with  WW3.  It would be a little like how we tend to link parts of WW1 and WW2 in history.  They'd see this part of history, that we're ironically in right now, as a very shameful part of their history, the things we're doing now as being part of what lead up to our eventual destruction.  They probably wouldn't want to revel in that, and maybe even not want to accidentally glean toxic ideas or influence from that, so they look to all other parts of human history for entertainment and ignore the war period.

4555,I've been watching Star Trek every single day for nearly four years,"Watching Trek has been part of my nightly routine for the past four years, I would lay in bed and watch for a bit until I started to doze off.  Sometimes I'd only last 15 minutes, sometimes I'd get through an episode, depends on how good it was and how tired I was :).  One thing for sure, it definitely helped me get to sleep, as I've always struggled with laying in bed for 40 minutes or so before I finally drift off.

Started with TOS in 2014 sometime, and just kinda kept going.  I watched I think every Trek there is except the animated series, in this order:

- Original series
- TOS Movies I through VI
- Kelvin timeline movies
- The Next Generation
- First Contact, Insurrection, Nemesis
- Deep Space Nine
- Voyager
- Enterprise

Most of these I'd already seen in their original releases, with the exception of Nemesis and most of Voyager (not sure why, just never got into it and it paled in comparison to DS9 which was running at the same time).

It's been a long road (sorry, I just finished ENT).  I'm tempted to just start over again but I don't want to ""burn myself out"" on Trek and make it boring.  I'm here for suggestions - any other Sci-Fi series from the Trek era I should consider watching?  Contenders I've been thinking about are Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica (liked the 1970's version but never watched the new one), Stargate series, maybe Farscape?

But where are they getting the anti matter? Currently it's the most valuable substance on the planet. CERN can generate like 6 anti-hydrogen molecules at a time using the LHC. 

Is there somewhere on say, the Enterprise we don't see that's just producing anti matter in large and relatively cheap quantities?

4558,STD: what a disappointment,"So I'm a big time trek fan (though I hate the JJAbrams reboots, I still watched them because the name Trek was on it), unlike many trek fans I actually thought Voyager was better before 7 of 9 showed up (though the show only became popular thanks to her so whatever), loved Capt Janeway, Loved TNG, heck I remember recording the first episode of TNG on VHS for my uncle who was overseas when the series rebooted.  Heck, I even loved DS9, and my most rabid trek buddy didn't even like DS9 (though I think it got weaker when Sisco shaved his head, still it was a fun series I made time for in my schedule to see).   The first TV trek series I didn't get all on board with was Enterprise, I like Scott Bakula in a lot of things, just didn't really like Enterprise.  Not sure what it was, it just never resonated with me, though I did watch every episode.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is sort of meandering, but I have a point to make.  I actually paid CBS to watch STD, and I got to say, this will probably be the first ST series I can't finish.  I was horrified with episode one, and it just got worse from there.  I'm not sure what STD is, but it doesn't resemble star trek in the least, no I take that back, it does strongly resemble JJAbrams terrible films.  The characters are flat and lifeless, there few people who get development are horrible people.  I wanted to like Michael, but I just can't.  She's petulant, obnoxious probably psychopathic and clearly insane.  Not in a funny way insane, like legit, how do they let this woman hold dining utensils she should be in a padded room level of insane.  I've looked about online looking for anyone mentioning just how nuts she her character is and no one says it.  The fact that no one is staying the obvious about Michael makes me scratch my head and wonder if I'm taking crazy Michael's crazy pills myself.  What I think is happening is the rest of the crew, the plot and even the villains are just as nuts as she is so she doesn't stand out as particularly loony.  How does this tripe pass as good writing?  If I ever watched something that should be exhibit A for investigating the psychological health of the writing and directing crew this show would be it.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it's just bad TV.  To make matters worse my old trek buddy.  You know, a friend who learned Klingon back when we were in middle school, warned me not to watch this.  I wish I had listened.  I was appalled when he wanted me to watch a Seth McFarlin trek knockoff instead and stubbornly paid CBS to watch discovery.  So after I ditched this mess I checked out the Orville.  And while the humor strays a bit low brow, and I can't stand the helmsmen character, it was almost like a breath of fresh air to blow the stink of STD out of my lungs.  As much as I hate Family Guy and pretty much everything Seth McFarlin touches, the Orville is the most trek thing we've had in decades.  And it's depressing the heck out of me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway just wanted to vent my frustration.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Long time Trekkie, hate STD, loathed to admit the Orville is the best ""trek"" since probably Discovery, despite the humor which tends to be a bit childish and lowbrow at times; upset that STD couldn't have been written and directed by sane trek fans, not JJAbrams flunkies.

to get straight to the point, i grew up watching trek, mostly reruns of TOS and some later TNG, my family overall are rather big trekkies, but now i find myself an adult with children myself, at abit of an impass. what can i show them apart from the exact same older trek i used to watch myself? discovery does not seem suitable to watch with them, i had high hopes for axanar being of some decent quality to be able to watch with them but it would seem that is going to take a while before its out!, does anyone have any recommendations of any modern made fan fic that might be suitable? anyone else having similar issues with this own ""younger"" children? :)",startrek,1546874452,Mogz80,33,1,True,2019-01-07

4586,What Star Trek Could Be,"*I’ve been thinking about the past and future of Star Trek a lot in the past year. I don’t think the franchise has been living up to its potential for decades. This is not a view based entirely in nostalgia—I do not think a return to the strict formulae of the 1960s or the 1990s is what is needed to move forward. But I do advocate taking what is valuable from the past and bringing that with us into the future as we consider something new. So here are a few broad strokes on what I’d like to see from Star Trek at the movies (and on TV) in that future. My pipe dreams for what Star Trek could be.*

“STAR TREK offers an almost infinite number of exciting Science Fiction stories…” —G.R., 1964

I want to see Star Trek storytelling like the stars themselves: full of amazing, fantastic, infinite experiences. I’m tired of war and vengeance at the movies—you can get that almost anywhere these days. Let’s see what the 25th century has to offer. Let’s see films and shows boasting epic scope, imagination, and a sense of wonder. Both huge and intimate at the same time: personal human stories on a canvas the size of the galaxy. Star Trek needs to feel like it is pushing the boundaries of human understanding and possibility. I want Star Trek to be expansive, open-minded and large-hearted, enthralled with the insane promise that human beings will someday venture to the very stars and find there new life and new civilizations. I want to be awed at the movies and thrilled for the future.

Star Trek proposes a radical hope: that humanity will be alive and thriving in the centuries to come, will have overcome greed and scarcity, will have helped to build an intragalactic coalition of peoples and worlds in the spirit of egalitarian cooperation, and will satisfy its deep desire to explore by relentlessly pushing the boundaries of the ultimate frontier, looking ever outward (and inward to know ourselves). I need that hope right now; a lot of humans do. We need more collective, cultural hope. We need to see futures on-screen that make us yearn to realize them, not ones promising more despair.

“These are the voyages…” So let’s voyage. I want Star Trek to make me feel like I’m on a ship soaring between the stars again. Show us grand ambitions we can aspire to, show us what life might be like as we sail the deep. Star Trek’s traditional understanding that interstellar travel, even faster-than-light, will take a long time (although shortened to several hours or days to serve the needs of fiction) allows us to spend time with the characters on their journeys. Travel times of mere seconds or minutes make the galaxy feel small, and don’t allow us much time to digest or to experience life aboard ship. I want to feel the flight. The odyssey, the quest, the trek. We’re on a starship! The word still gives me chills. What could be more grand, what venture more exciting? An “enterprise” is both “a vigorous and determined undertaking” and one’s “initiative and resourcefulness.” I’d like to feel both senses of the word when I see a Star Trek movie.

I want Star Trek that is preachy and fun, joyful and serious, and unapologetically earnest and bold about its humanistic values, even if that seems corny now. I want Star Trek helmed by people who believe in optimism over pessimism, hope over despair, truth over ignorance, peace over violence, cooperation over isolation, tolerance over fear, love over hatred, compassion over selfishness, beauty over ugliness, and reason over irrationality. I want Star Trek that believes in “the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are capable of as human beings.”

I like action movies as much as the next guy, but the mode of the modern action movie is overstimulation, usually asking as little from its audience as possible—and cranking out middling action titles is not what Star Trek is best at. If we're going to do action, let's do it well! Star Trek’s purpose originally was thoughtful action-adventure for adults, something that didn’t exist in science fiction. Trek’s first models were Westerns (the most popular TV and film genre of the time), shows like *Wagon Train* and *Have Gun Will Travel*. Those still aren’t bad models. These shows featured adults dealing with moral or ethical dilemmas (as thorny as television advertisers of the 1950s would allow) in the course of their travels, overcoming these problems with boldness, empathy, sharp wit, and tough action when necessary (the violence is at a minimum in a show like Have Gun, which ironically is about a man who tries to use his gun as little as possible). That’s what Trek was intended to be, but with the distinct possibilities that space/time travel, parallel worlds, and alien lifeforms, etc, hold for storytelling. “Thoughtful action-adventure for adults” includes action, though it doesn’t rule out lightheartedness or even whimsy—a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men, after all—but it does rule out cynicism and having our heroes solve problems with violence as a first resort. Conversely, optimism and lightheartedness don’t equal naiveté or silliness. Imbuing a show or movie an essentially optimistic worldview does not mean it can’t be taken seriously or deal with mature matters, but that maturity doesn’t mean it has to be ugly, disturbing, and violent (qualities often mistaken for maturity). 

(Aside: These were always lofty goals. There will always be failures. Sometimes attempts won’t succeed, and episodes won’t hit the mark, but in those cases you can still usually understand what the writers were trying to do, whether or not it works. People like to bring up bad episodes and movies in these discussions as if that proves Star Trek is nothing special. But the existence of bad episodes does not prove that Trek isn’t philosophical or good, just that the people making it were/are only human. Sometimes our reach exceeds our grasp, but that’s okay. Failures of execution are understandable. There’s a difference between subverting the ethos of a show and merely not living up to its ideal.)

Sometimes I’ll finish a movie and think “Why can’t we have Star Trek movies like that?” I think Star Trek needs new templates. There are a few movies and genres I think could serve as blueprints for Star Trek to build from, or which at least contain some attributes which Trek could take inspiration from. For example:

*Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003): This is a film about trust, leadership, camaraderie, and the tensions of command and duty and brotherhood. And for me, this is how you show life aboard a ship at war: by focusing more on the life and the ship than the war—and when it’s time to battle, emphasizing clever strategy and then, yes, when called for, violence. But Tolkien’s line (spoken by Faramir in THE TWO TOWERS) comes to mind: “War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” If Star Trek must show us war, then do it this way, with a dose of humor and exploration, with a distaste for blood and disintegrations, and a love for what is worth defending.

*Interstellar* (2014): I know that opinions are mixed on this movie, but there are two key takeaways for Star Trek. One is the film’s vision of humanity saving itself: we have the intelligence, we just need the will. I find that very powerful, even if it is absurd to hope for. The second is the small, human story of a father and daughter told within a larger, high-concept science-fictional framework. Intimate and epic at the same time. This is the kind of storytelling I think Star Trek is well suited for.

*Arrival* (2016): Not much trekking is done here, but there are precious few films that put this much weight upon the value of learning one another’s languages, of the urgent need for communication and cooperation. Star Trek should be sending these messages.

Exploration movies like *Mountains of the Moon* (1990; the story of a real British expedition to find the source of the Nile river), *The Way Back* (2010; a WWII survival drama chronicling a perilous journey across five countries in a desperate race for freedom), or *The Lost City of Z* (2016; another story of a real explorer in the 1920s who discovered evidence of an advanced civilization in the Amazon rainforest) could serve as inspiration for modes of storytelling in Star Trek. Imagine new dramas in the Star Trek universe that center upon pioneers, that show exploration as something personal, extremely difficult but worth doing. Or stories that celebrate nature’s mysteries and the human spirit resolved to survive against cosmic odds.

Some of the great British war epics tell stories of individuals within wartime situations that don’t spend all their time reveling in the horrors of war itself, movies like *The Four Feathers* (an action-adventure “war” epic showing that selfless courage is displayed in ways besides fighting), *Lawrence of Arabia*, *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, and so many more. I’m not saying these particular stories should be cloned and put into spacesuits, but this type of filmmaking (meticulously composed character study / psychological drama mixed with roaring adventure, films that make you feel something and give you time to feel it, stories that often feel personal and mythological at the same time) is very appealing to me. Star Trek can and should escape the rut of “futuristic action” once in a while and move back into “the human adventure is just beginning” mode.

And Star Trek’s own fictional universe is rich. There is plenty of room to tell new stories, or even—maybe—to revisit old stories with a new eye. With current visual effects, we could come across a mysterious Dyson sphere or a hollowed-out asteroid ship, and really feel awe at the scale of such a construct as our heroes do. We could re-learn the story of the fate of Earth’s own early interstellar probes (yes, I do think a remake of *The Motion Picture* could work, in the right hands—with TMP, again, the failure is in the bland execution of the story, not the story itself or what it’s trying to achieve), or perhaps the fates of Earth’s first colony ships. We could see stories that take place across decades or centuries, travel through time portals, into other dimensions, across our own galaxy—not just because it’s under attack or something, but to know ourselves, to understand some ancient mystery or just to meet some new, utterly alien species. There are dozens of Star Trek novels telling ambitious, entertaining stories (ones like *Federation* or *Prime Directive* come to mind) that could be adapted for film, even loosely adapted, instead of making revenge stories over and over.

I’ll end with some visual inspiration, a “mood board” of the kinds of things I imagine when I think about all the above. ([Album link here](https://imgur.com/a/gvL9Uvj), or read on below.)

● [This is a photo of Earth from the Apollo 7 mission](https://imgur.com/pelybNl). Humankind in space is itself hugely inspiring. In the movies, I’d love to see VFX of planets like this, from low orbits making them look like real worlds. [Source](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/40th/images/apollo_image_6.html)

● [This is a shot from *Interstellar* of the Endurance orbiting Saturn](https://imgur.com/xR3UurK). There’s a similar shot of the Enterprise inside V’Ger in TMP that I like. Compositions like these really drive home the enormity of the undertaking of space exploration and the vastness of our (or any) solar system. Expansive stories need sights and sounds to match.

● [Less realistic but with no less scope and scale is this painting by John Harris](https://imgur.com/ZsBbIyv) (unknown date / title), which shows a colorful encounter with an impressive piece of astronomical engineering.

● [In the same impressionistic vein, this John Berkey painting](https://imgur.com/MKWY4hf) (unknown date / title) demonstrates, as a lot of Berkey’s space paintings do, the color and flair missing from a lot of sci-fi visuals today. The lighting in this one really sells a mood.

● [In the opposite direction, this Andy Probert illustration](https://imgur.com/xTxzuWE) shows the Enterprise as any vessel would look in deep space—dark. I like this image because it makes the ship feel like a submarine, and somewhat mysterious. 

● [This 1973 painting by Rick Guidice](https://imgur.com/GM7LWMR) is a mythological metaphor for the Voyager probes’ gravity-assist “slingshot” maneuvers around Jupiter, and can also be read as man hurling himself to the stars.

● [This rendering \(by Lee Stringer\)](https://imgur.com/iXJ6ypp) of a lone astronaut walking on the Enterprise-D shows the scale of this fictional feat of engineering as well as humanizing it. Imagine being that person, standing there for the first time or the fiftieth. [Source](http://www.leestringer.com/gal_trekother.html)

● [Lou Feck did a bunch of great cover art](https://imgur.com/cqQHZNV) for the Blish TOS episode novelizations, but this is my favorite. It gives human dimension to a strange alien landscape, the Enterprise streaking overhead as our three heroes consider their next moves.

4589,"Picard, villainy unmasked","As seen in TNG’s Moriarty, Voyager’s failed Hirogen experiment, EMH programs, and Quark’s holosuites, self-awareness in simulated minds can spontaneously generate very easily. Usually, (in both TNG and VOY, at least,) this is due to sentience being necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Challenging Data or the hunters, for example.

We also know that, when the computer storing said sentient program is on but the program is not running, the consciousness experiences a sort of timeless, helpless torture.

This moral quandary is explored violently in the holographic revolution against the Hirogen, but at least the programs escape their captors eventually.

We also know sentience is not due to an accident or occasional glitch, since Moriarty just asked the computer to upgrade Regina to a sentient being and the computer complies instantly.

At last, here is my point. Moriarty and Regina are placed inside a simulated galaxy with miniature holographic projections, with the intent of fooling the pair into thinking they are in the real universe. This digital universe cannot fail to buffer once, or simulate even minor inconsistencies, or the world’s greatest detective smarter than even Data would surely discover the truth.

We can assume, then, the simulation creates thousands or even millions of locations and people whenever Moriarty and Regina land on a new planet to account for all their potential choices.

It also stands to reason that a genius sentient hologram could not be fooled into thinking a non-sentient computer program is truly intelligent. To challenge the pair, the galaxy cube would have to create sentient characters to interact with.

Now, not even Federation technology would allow a computer the size of a fist run an entire galaxy 24/7. Like any procedural generation, only what is in the vicinity of the user needs to be rendered. But, in case the venturing pair ever goes to the same planet twice, any characters they interact with would need to be ‘saved’ by the computer’s memory. This would be true for even minor interactions, seeing as both criminal masterminds have eidetic artificial memories.

There are thousands, millions, perhaps billions of intelligent artificial lifeforms trapped in a sort of existential horror that would make Harlan Ellison blanche.

4592,Discovery Season 2 Premiere Review Collection,"https://comicbook.com/startrek/2019/01/07/star-trek-discovery-season-2-review/

&gt;Star Trek: Discovery returns for its second with the premiere episode titled “Brother.” While remaining true to the groundwork laid down last season, the premiere is flush with new confidence and a thirst for adventure.

https://www.cnet.com/news/star-trek-discovery-season-2-discovers-a-new-sense-of-adventure/

&gt;Season 2 of Discovery is set to confront the crew with themes of faith and belief, meaning there'll be lots to think about -- an essential part of Trek. But by the time Captain Pike promises Burnham a fun ride, season 2 has set out its stall with wit, intrigue and action.   

https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/star-trek/278352/star-trek-discovery-season-2-episode-1-review-brother

&gt;For those who were frustrated with the action-oriented frenzy of the first season, Star Trek: Discovery season 2 is not going to totally assuage those frustrations. There is a commitment to the wonder of scientific exploration in certain parts of this season premiere--most notably, in the delightful introduction of Tig Notaro's Engineer Denise Reno--but this first episode is weighed down (with little pay off thus far) by the angsty mystery of Michael's mysterious, absent brother.

https://decider.com/2019/01/07/star-trek-discovery-season-2-premiere-brother-review/

&gt;Discovery is back in a big way with new cast members, a new mission, and one of the most action-filled adventures ever filmed in the Star Trek universe. This is big screen storytelling on a small screen, and it is awesome.

A good point was made that the essential need for personal, physical, and emotional comfort would be needed on a long term deep space mission.

When Janeway modifies Michael Sullivan and modifies his protocols I feel that if this idea were to be successful that you shouldn’t be able to modify such things, because it turns you into a God among ants.

It's just little things, they way the characters talk to each other, the clothing, the fact they wear ""civilian clothing"" far more often. They seem to be more into ""modern"" (from their perspective) things, where many characters in Star Trek are reminiscing about a distant past (i.e. Archer's polo vs Sisko's baseball).

4626,"After 13 years, it finally happened: Yesterday, my wife watched Star Trek 😂","My wife and are couldn't be more opposite. She's athletic, I'm computery. She likes rap and country music, I like rock and punk. She likes mixing cocktails, I've been a lifelong teetotaler (until only recently, over the past 2 years). She enjoys social gatherings, I'm content to read a book (or reddit ;-P). I love nerdy sci-fi and fantasy stuff, videogames, and Dungeons and Dragons; she grew up literally *making fun of that stuff*. She enjoys the outdoors, I'm an ""avid indoorsman."" She wears her heart on her sleeve, I'm cerebral. As one of our very good friends observed, after staying with us for a month and a half in between apartment leases, ""You guys have *absolutely nothing in common*,"" lol.

After many attempts over the years of seeing if my wife was interested in watching Star Trek, *she wouldn't budge*. The nerdiness, the prosthetic forehead makeup, everything. I had resigned that this would just be something I enjoy by myself and with other sci-fi-inclined friends.

There's definitely a recent pivotal change that was the ""crux"" to get her to watch Star Trek, but here's the deeper genealogy that set the stage...

Like many pop-cultural people, she enjoyed *Star Wars* well-enough as a casual person. She couldn't tell you anything detailed, like about how &gt;!Anakin becomes Vader!&lt;, etc., but just in that pop-casual way, could enjoy the movies. We have kiddos, so we've occasionally watched one with them, taken them to the theater to see the new ones, etc.

I was able to get her interested in watching *Firefly*, perhaps around \~8 years ago or so(?), by pointing out that the writer described the show as basically like ""the adventures of Han Solo."" She liked it!

Then when we moved for me to go to grad-school, I was able to convince her, perhaps around \~6 years ago or so now, to watch *Battlestar Galactica.* I noted ""there's zero forehead aliens"" (lol), and it's more like a drama about humanity and inter-personal relationships than anything else. She absolutely loved it, and we binged it like that hilarious Portlandia skit of the couple, watching [""just one more episode.""](https://youtu.be/AyHXzYTuLi4)

Having kiddos over the years helped, because they inevitably became little mini-pseudo-nerds, as well 😂. So whatever they happen to be interested in, mommy tags along with. So this introduced the once-every-couple-years trip to the Renaissance Festival (hehe), getting my daughter into reading Harry Potter, etc.

A couple-few years ago, I had tried to get my kiddos to watch Star Trek with me, but it was still over their heads. (They were perhaps like ages 8 and 6, not including the younger toddlers). They definitively *didn't* like it, and even actively *disliked* it (whoops). 

Above and beyond sci-fi stuff, over the years we also watched general action-fun stuff together: *24* with Jack Bauer, *Alias*, etc. This made an easy segue to watching *The Expanse*, which was the SyFy channel's new show to compete with *The Walking Dead* and *Game of Thrones*. My wife loved it, with the interesting plot unfolding, political intrigue, etc. (We'd also watched *The Walking Dead* over the years.) (Side note: thank God that Amazon picked up *The Expanse* for a fourth season. 🔥)

That leads up to this week. A couple-ish years had transpired, and so I decided my daughter was older now (\~10), more mature and thoughtful, and had a bit more nerdiness under her belt. Instead of having the kids sit with me through an episode, I decided it might be more effective to casually leave an episode running in the living room, to see if my kiddos naturally gravitated to it on their own (without me there). While I'm slightly OCD about chronology and such, I decided the best one she might like would be *Voyager*, with Captain Janeway and Neelix. I skipped the somewhat circuitous pilot episode (against my OCD tendencies), to find a bit more of a ""normal"" self-contained Trek episode. BOOM -- she started watching it almost instantly, lol. I left it running, occasionally flitting in and out of the room to gander, and she ended up watching *three episodes straight.*

Now, my wife would *never* even ***entertain*** the idea of potentially sitting in and watching *Star Trek*. But a year ago, I had asked if she had wanted to try out *The Orville.* I pointed out that it was a comedy in addition to sci-fi, was pitched as more down-to-earth and fun, so might be more like a combination of one of these *Firefly*\-type shows mixed with the laughs of *Friends* or something. Of course, I knew that *The Orville* was 100% formulaic riffing on *Star Trek*, so who knows? Maybe she could get into Star Trek after this, etc. We tried it out, and she really enjoyed it! Mix of fun laughs, interesting stories and characters, new ""adventures"" each week, etc.

So after my daughter was seemingly enthusiastic about *Voyager*, the next day (yesterday) I fired it up again for her. She practically *immediately* came to watch it. I wandered to do my own thing, but upon checking later, *MY WIFE WAS WITH MY DAUGHTER WATCHING IT!* She had become accustomed so much to the formula of *The Orville* that the entire thing was completely and utterly familiar: the uniforms, the ship, the cinematography, the bridge, the crew, the shuttle away missions, *everything*. So I snuck in and started watching with them 😁. One of the best parts was when someone used the food replicator, and my wife turned to me and said, ""like *The Orville!"",* looool.

So we had fun yesterday, and I started explaining about the combined crews on *Voyager* between the Maquis versus the Federation, etc. (because it was the episode about some Maquis crewmembers disobeying Janeway, etc.) So my wife and daughter decided it'd be good to circle back now and watch the pilot before we got too far into it, learn the proper backstory, etc. So it was a blast!

4646,How would I get permission to publish a book that uses Star Trek IP? No history of working in that world.,"Hi all. So, I've had an idea for a book for a few years now. It would be a book that is set in the star trek universe but isn't a novel and isn't narrative fiction - think of it something like the technical manuals. Its an idea that takes the concepts in ST seriously and then uses them to explore something that would happen in that world, but doing so in a serious way ends up being humorous if you follow the concept to its logical ends. I am confident that this book would have a small but 100% guaranteed audience - many people on this sub would probably love it. And it has never been done before. It wouldn't be the next Harry Potter, but it would definitely turn a profit. That said there's a huge catch.

I'm not an author, have never published anything, and don't know a darn thing about the highfalutin world of corporate IP, licenses, etc. I picture that ""world"" of authors being all based on relationships - you get a license just because people know you. I've never met an author and live on the exact opposite side of the US from the entertainment business. How would I submit my idea to someone for consideration and get permission to execute on it? I am almost positive that if someone who understands Star Trek and Trek's audience was in a position to hear it they'd like it. And its a fairly no risk thing I think - my lack of track record not withstanding.

Hopefully someone has some input for how I could proceed. I've tried to forget about this idea for the better part of a decade because I'm not an author but it keeps coming up in my head and it remains original and funny. ",startrek,1547040820,i_dont_like_reddit_6,11,1,True,2019-01-09

4652,"Voyager- Nothing Human, excellent and relevant episode","I was recently discussing with friends the notion of high-profile celebrities being accused of certain things like sexual assault and the like. Celebs like Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen etc are now facing their past violations in the public eye. Specifically we were talking about separating art from the artist. Can you still find works from these people entertaining? Should you watch them at all? Before these allegations came to light I would've counted Kevin Spacey among my favorite actors, but now, knowing what we know, I would never consider that. However, what does that mean for previous works that feature him? Should they be wiped from history?

As we were discussing I realized, as I do a lot, that there is a Star Trek for that. Nothing Human came to mind. A hologrpahic recreation of a Cardassian doctor that has the knowledge from his studies to potentially cure Torres. His research was unethical, he committed heinous, awful crimes, but at the same time his knowledge could save lives on major scales. So, a moral quandary ensues. Admittedly, I cannot recall how the episode ended, so I don't know what stance the crew ended up taking, but it's a grey area I feel we face today. 

Obviously malpractice and human medical experimentation/murder of patients is very different from celebrities being downright awful people, but I do feel the question is similar enough for discussion in the lens of Trek. 

If we discovered tomorrow that somebody history holds in high regard that changed the world had molested children or murdered, would history change its judgement? If Christopher Nolan was discovered to do any of these things, is it okay to watch his works like The Dark Knight Rises or Interstellar and enjoy them? 

After WWII former Nazi scientists were hired and that had a direct impact on landing on the moon 20 years or so later, should that accomplishment have asterisks?

4657,What is bad Star Trek and why?,"I binged all of Star Trek when I was pretty young, and I am now revisiting it. While In the Pale Moonlight, Best of Both Worlds, and Balance of Terror are all delightful to watch, I keep finding myself sitting down with drinks and friends and putting on some absolutely bizarre episodes. Sub Rosa, A Fistful of Datas, Real Life, Our Man Bashir, etc. I also keep finding myself saying ""Terrible Star Trek is fantastic"".

&amp;#x200B;

So in what case can Star Trek be largely unenjoyable? I think one of the best things about Star Trek is that it felt very organic and a lot of episodes seemed like a writer had a weird idea and just went with it. Not everything turns into an amazing episode of television, but is seems noticeable that even when an episode is absurd and crappy it feels like the writer and actors all had fun. Even Threshold and Tuvix are just kinda hilarious and not devoid of that weird spark which makes Star Trek interesting.

Right now, though, I haven't seen a ton of discussion on what's going on with Star Trek 4, or the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, I saw this article: [https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/i-am-the-night-patty-jenkins-chris-pine-1203102592/](https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/i-am-the-night-patty-jenkins-chris-pine-1203102592/) 

(‘I Am the Night’: Chris Pine and Patty Jenkins on Trust and Collaboration - Variety - 01/09/2019 - 

&amp;#x200B;

It occurs to me that Patty Jenkins might be the right person to tap next for a Star Trek film, and not just because she's close with Chris Pine (Although that did bring this to mind). Out of the DCEU films, the most cohesive one thus far has been Wonder Woman. On top of that, Jenkins would be one of the directors who could probably work with the studio in order to get the project off the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth both dropping out during negotiations was obviously the final straw for now, but it doesn't necessarily mean that another film will NEVER happen. ( [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-4-chris-pine-chris-hemsworth-talks-fall-1133802](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-4-chris-pine-chris-hemsworth-talks-fall-1133802) \- An Articel On The Subject) Beyond definitely should have gotten the box office it deserved, given that it's definitely one of the best Star Trek films, but since it didn't, I'm sure that Paramount aren't as willing to fork over the massive amount of money it would take to get both stars without knowing the film is going to be a slam dunk.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole production has been really odd, with two separate movies seemingly in development at least at the earliest stages. The first being the proposed film that S.J. Clarkson was supposed to helm before this week's news that she will be working on the Game of Thrones prequel, and likely won't be able to work on the Star Trek film. That film is supposed to have something to do with George Kirk, which is an interesting idea without knowing any more of the premise. The Tarantino Project on the other hand is completely wrapped in mystery, and it was always odd to me that both of those projects were being talked about now.

&amp;#x200B;

This is literally just rambling on my part, but I would really like to see at least one more Kelvin movie, if only to give them a sendoff. I hope it would lead to more films, but at this point, it seems like they may even be gearing up to do something new in terms of Star Trek movies. I would be really interested if they decided to do a new crew altogether, and I might even welcome that if they went past the Picard show they're about to do (Which apparently follows after the destruction of Romulus in the prime universe).

But it comes with a downside, with the exception of game of thrones I havent really enjoyed any other TV i have watched since, nothing else seems to come close to the enjoyment I get from watching Trek, modern TV just seems to have next to no depth and never goes on long enough for characters to really develop like they do in ST, with the exception of game of thrones being the only other show I have kept up to date with.

You broke the Universe.""  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM5dD7PLSIA&amp;t=1h35m20s  

...OOOOOF!  

I didn't even think of that aspect of the Picard show yet, with the JJ Movies and Discovery hyper-modernizing everything in the TOS era, how the hell do you make post-TNG look 120 years more advanced than even that?  

And that while hopefully still somehow staying true and Fan-Service-y to the TNG/TNG-Movie look &amp; feel to at least some extent? Sure it is in the future from TNG, 25 years, but the technology jump now has to be completely ridiculous going from TNG and the TNG Movies to the Picard Show, unless they completely ignore the JJ Movies and Discovery reboot stuff and just go with TNG as the base, but that would then alienate the new Fans that only know the flashy JJ/Discovery stuff.... which won't happen anyway because none of those old Art Assets or original Talent are around anymore to influence any of that and the Discovery stuff is just sitting there waiting to be used.  

...just think about that one while you complain about 60's TOS sets looking ugly.  

Now going from TNG to the Picard show is going to be a mess or going from Discovery to the Picard show is going to be a mess, there is no way they can make both camps happy now.

4674,Discovery: First time viewing.,"I just watched Star Trek Discovery for the first time. I know it has been pretty divisive among fans and we see it a lot from time to time on here. Lately a lot more love for the show, which is a good thing. I just wanted to list some things I loved about the show and some things I didn't. I want to know what you all think about Discovery as well while we all wait for the second season. I want positive with the negative or just a good old fashioned discussion.

Things I loved:

- Updated Visuals: The Shinzhou, The Discovery, Q'onos, The Klingons, Tellerites, Andorians, viewscreens, communicators, phasors, the uniforms, all look amazing. Everything. I love them. I see pictures of the Enterprise uniforms and get giddy with excitement.

- The Spore Drive: Some seriously fun stuff. Introducing the mycelial network was pretty good science fiction. Kind of a nod to String Theory? Maybe? Also including tardigrades and inventing a giant ""4th dimensional being"" ancestor to waterbears, was grade A+ stuff.

- Lorca: (More so Jason Isaacs acting). Probably my favorite character, even up until the big reveal close to the end. I knew it was coming because of reddit but still enjoyed it. A great villain that died too soon IMO.

- The Klingon War: The most interesting thing about the show so far to me. It is great to finally show the major hostility being brought to light between the two factions. It makes since as to why Klingons are treated the way they are in TOS/TOS films. They are coming down from of a major crisis.

- Pahvans: A great science fiction idea, that the ""lifeforce"" or the entire planet itself evolves to become sentiant, one that takes part in harmony yet cannot tell others.

- Harry Mudd. A great callback character who was greatly expanded upon. *Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad* was probably my favorite episode. It was pure Star Trek and pure science fiction.

Thinks I didn't like:

- Sarek: While I enjoy the portrayal and having him around in general, I feel that his character was fundamentally misunderstood. Sarek really hid his emotions and him showing them to Michael every so often when he never does to Spock felt way off. (Also, no Sybock love? I think with some heavier hitters like Sarek and Spock, less is more. They could expand on more minor characters with more believability easier. Harry Mudd and Pike are perfect examples of this.

- Holo-Communicators: Doesn't work for me. Not practical in the universe at this time. I get that holograms probably exist in this time period but they were used way too much. First time we see a holo-communicator is in Undiscovered Country if I remember correctly. I guess I wouldnt mind if the were used like once every so often. But, when the view screens were used, it looked really nice and felt natural amd practical.

- Mirror Georgiou: Just... no. Should have left her where she belongs. Mirror Universe is already something that I was really tired of before Discovery. I liked what they did with it initially but stealing a slice of it to keep, especially a mirror version of one of the best actors and Captains we have... Curious to see how much of her we see.

- Ash Tyler: Probably my least favorite element of the show was this character. Between the shoehorned and extremely rushed romance between him and Michael, and the goofy *choH'a*' species reassignment which makes absolutely no sense to me, he made me yawn with boredom. I know we are watching Trek and its allowed to get kooky sometimes but it was just frustrating to watch.

Overall I liked the show. There are other things I could have put on both lists but I am typing this up on a short break at work. Those were the highlights of my experience and I am very excited to see what comes next!",startrek,1547089919,CT-1138,27,1,True,2019-01-09

In the past there's been a lot of debate about whether Kirk is saying ""glans"" (penis) or ""glands"" (ambiguous) in *The Man Trap*. to McCoy in *The Man Trip."" The transcripts, closed captions, and Memory alpha all say ""glands"" and not ""glans,"" and that seems to be the official word.

But... let's not forget the context of the scene. At the top of the episode, Kirk's log ends with ""Our mission, routine medical examination of archaeologist Robert Crater and his wife Nancy. Routine **but for the fact that Nancy Crater is that one woman in Doctor McCoy's past.**"" Then, after McCoy won't shut up about how he thinks she still looks 25 (and after the salt monster ate somebody) Kirk loses his patience with McCoy and he literally accuses McCoy of being so distracted by his attraction to Nancy that it is putting the crew in danger, when he said ""Stop thinking with your glands."" 

The writers may have written the word ""glands"" on the script. It may be true that the official word is ""glands."" But the writers meant glans. Kirk was saying telling McCoy to stop thinking with his dick. I don't think he was telling him not to think with his thyroid, Thymus, pituitary, pineal, sweat, salivary, sebacious, or mucus glands. You could argue that what Kirk was saying was so innocent that he meant ""don't think with your *adrenal* glands,"" and that would be a very generous interpretation, but willfully ignoring how much they are putting McCoy's lust for Nancy the salt monster is front-and-center in the episode.

However, I can think of one problem! Assuming you could generate some kind of artificial gravitational field to warp spacetime, that generated field would propagate out from your source at... exactly the speed of light (as shown recently by the confirmation of gravitational waves).

Thus, you could never move away from your start point at more than the speed of light, you can only merely ""ride"" the warp field you created in front of your ship.

I just want to say this. I don’t believe Lore Reloaded knows a lot about Political Science or has even watched that much of Deep Space Nine. 

The video that he submitted to Eckhart was a video on the failures of Democracy in Star Wars and Star Trek. Something that sounds extremely odd considering the Federation never collapsed nor turned into a military dictatorship (although it did get close).  Lore Reloaded (LR) refers to the Dominion Conflict as the reason the Federation’s democracy ultimately failed; that the fault of the conflict rested solely at the hands of the huge, multicultural Federation. 

Now, for anyone who has actually watched DS9; this isn’t true. The Dominion always had plans to attack the Federation and would have succeeded; if not for the discovery of the wormhole. The wormhole actually threw off the timescale for the Dominion in Alpha Canon as they needed to act rapidly to pin the Federation underfoot. 

The Dominion failed due to the intervention of the DS9 crew, a huge coalition of Klingon; Romulan; and Cardassian Rebels, and for Starfleet’s ingenuity. However, LR places the blame for the war on the Federation and it’s large diversity; also citing how the homogeneous Klingons defeated the Federation in Discovery (which is not what actually happened.) 

Now the Federation has only once had a problem with it’s democracy; namely one Admiral who tried to overthrow it, Admiral Leyton. Leyton is quickly brought to justice and the Federation is saved. However; this example actually goes against LR’s reasoning that the Federation’s Democracy is vulnerable. It isn’t. The Federation President, while not a war time leader, actually believed in the ideals of the Federation and was a reasonable authority figure who wanted evidence that Leyton planned to stage a coup. The Federation’s democracy and it’s ability to elect leaders actually shows its strength even as fear and hate spread. 

LR I feel has greatly misunderstood the value of Democracy in the Federation and believes that diversity and utopia are doomed to fail in the Star Trek universe. I however, believe the Federation’s ideals is what actually helps it. With the coalitions formed in the Dominion conflict and the ability of Federation citizens to elect a Federation President like Jaresh-Inyo; I believe that the Federation’s Democracy is not it’s weak point, but it’s strongest point.",startrek,1547149531,JMoc1,54,1,True,2019-01-10

Similarly, depending on the scene characters would at times manually do something and explain it vocally, or ask computer.

4701,State of the Subreddit: Rules Reminder and Season 2 Briefing,"Hi everyone!

As we're gearing up to head back onto the bridge of the Discovery for season 2 in one week's time, I wanted to put out a few quick reminders about our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/guidelines) and a general roundup of what's going on.

------------

**The Official r/StarTrek Spoiler Policy**

The original spoiler policy post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/14syqa/rstartreks_official_stance_on_spoilers_and/). This outlines our general 5 year mission in making sure people can come and enjoy Trek discussion on our sub without fearing spoilers. Please review this before posting anything that may be a spoiler.

To use the spoiler system in comments:

&gt;Type: [VOY 2x15 Spoilers\] (#s ""Paris and Janeway have lizard babies!"")

&gt;And you get: [VOY 2x15 Spoilers](#s ""Paris and Janeway have lizard babies!"")

To use the spoiler system in links click the ""spoiler"" link at the bottom of your submission.

While we don't generally *enforce* spoiler tagging for the older shows/movies, we do ask that everyone does their level best not to be That Douchebag who ruins Wrath of Khan for a bright-eyed young fan. Don't Be A Dick. WWPD. Etc.

For DSC-related spoilers, our policy is as follows:

&gt;**We ask that you utilise the spoiler system for any and all season 2 Discovery-related spoilers, especially those relating to the most recently aired episodes. Posts which have spoilers in the title will be removed**. Posts containing spoilers will be marked as spoilers by the mod team. If you're not sure if your post contains a spoiler, tag it as one anyway just in case! Those of us who have to wait to watch the show will thank you.

We will not be quite as strict for spoilers for season 1 of Discovery as we are operating on the assumption that most people visiting the sub will have seen it, but we will be using the general Don't Be A Dick guidelines above.

**Please note:** this will also be true of the Episode Discussion threads, where we currently ask that you **spoiler tag any references to *future episodes***. This includes cast/crew discussions from behind the scenes and spoilers from interviews/trailers. 

Note: we're not saying that you can't discuss these things, only that you take a moment to use the spoiler tag system and be courteous to your fellow fans, who may not want to be spoiled for future episodes while reading about the one that has just aired.

**To summarise:**

* Details about an episode of DSC that has **recently aired** = spoilers, please tag appropriately/do not put in titles
* Details about an **unaired** episode of DSC = spoilers, please tag appropriately/do not put in titles
* Details about an episode of **season 1 of DSC** = POSSIBLE spoilers, no need to tag but please don't put too much detail in titles
* Details about an episode of another previously aired* Trek show/movie = POSSIBLE spoilers, no need to tag but please don't put too much detail in titles, will be judged on a case-by-case basis

\* details about the upcoming Picard/Lower Decks etc shows will be treated in the same way as current DSC spoilers. Obviously.

----------------------

**Conduct**

Our general conduct policy and guide on what kind of posts we remove from the sub can be found on our [rules wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/guidelines). These rules have not changed and will continue to be enforced.

As a quick reminder, the following will get your post/comment **instantly removed** and may also result in a warning/ban:

* hate speech of any kind (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc)
* untagged spoilers (see above for further info)
* links or comments designed to provide links (i.e. ""PM me for.."") to pirated content
* personal insults

The following **may** result in your post/comment removed, subject to moderator review:

* inflammatory language which is written in bad faith or in order to start an argument/derail a thread. This includes: accusations of trolling or shilling; ranty/angry comments which do not add to the discussion in any way (i.e. ""ENT is awful"" in an unrelated thread); overly political comments; complaints about networks or non-Trek properties.
* meta complaints/ranting about should or should not be allowed on the sub. This should be sent to Modmail so we can review it as a team.

---------

**Season 2 Plans**

For DSC season 2 we will be following the same format as season 1 as it seemed to work well and was generally well received. For those new to the sub, this format will be in the form of a pre-episode discussion posted a couple of days before the episode airs, a live discussion post once the episode has been released, and a post-episode discussion which will remain up for a few days to allow everyone to talk about what happened.

The previous Discovery discussion threads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/discoverydiscussion).

We will have all of the links and episode info once it’s announced in the sidebar of the sub (in both old and new Reddit formats) as usual.

**The State of the Sub**

We've gained another 10k readers in the last 4 months since the [last SotS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/9d7gs4/state_of_the_subreddit_flairs_spoilers_and/) and have now rounded 180k total subscribers! Will we get to 200k in 2019? We certainly hope so!

As a team we're thrilled to see this sub growing from strength to strength and with so much more Trek content on the horizon we can't wait to see what the future holds for our community. We hope you're all equally excited to be along for the ride!

4707,Theory: Voyager and TOS take place in different timelines,"In the episode ""Future's End"", Captain Braxton's timeship gets thrown back to 1967 where it's discovered by Henry Starling who uses it's technology to jumpstart computer technology and essentially become Bill Gates. A few decades later, Voyager arrives in 1996 and makes an unpleasant discovery:

&amp;#x200B;

JANEWAY: The computer age of the 20th century...

&amp;#x200B;

CHAKOTAY: Should never have happened.

&amp;#x200B;

JANEWAY: But it did. And it's part of our history. All because of that timeship.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So if the history of the 20th century we know was as a result of Braxton's time ship crashing in the sixties, what would history have looked like if it *hadn't*? Well presumably all those scientists and great thinkers who, in our timeline, went to work in the computer industry, would have turned their attention to a different field? Like, genetics?

Maybe in that timeline they created a race of superhuman tyrants who ended up ruling over forty nations. Maybe, instead of being a period of relative global peace and prosperity, the nineties in that timeline was a period of brutal war that resulted in the deaths of thirty million people? And maybe, in that timeline, human advancement in computer technology was set back so badly that even by the 23rd century computers were less advanced than what we have today (and even had frickin' *buttons*).

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my theory; TOS takes place in the original, unaltered timeline, and Voyager takes place in an entirely different timeline that was created by Braxton's ship crash landing in the sixties.

4708,Discovery: Klingon hair,"So Alex Kurtzman had this to say on why Klingons had no hair in Discovery season 1 ...

**""There was so much debate about the Klingon hair. Why don’t the Kligons have hair? Why did you redesign the Klingons? Your life is over! Actually, Glenn Hetrick who does our prosthetics and Neville Page came up with this idea that in a time of war, the Klingons all shave their body hair. It’s a version of saying “We are committing to war” and that was the logic for them not having hair. And really through an error of omission, we realized we never made that clear in any context. People were like “These are not the Klingons!” And in season two, we were like “Let’s tell them why” and that was because it was a time of war.”**

If this is true then why have we never seen Klingons cut their hair during any other point in the series when they were at war. When they went to war with the federation they had hair. When they fought the Dominion they had hair. In fact if anything, their hair seems to symbolize their warrior spirit and it's like a badge of honor to them. It's similar to how the samurai held significance on their hair from what I remember reading. I've heard people argue how well researched into Star Trek lore Discovery is but little details like this makes me think otherwise. It just seems like Kurtzman got most of his knowledge of the series through wikipedia and is making up the rest as he goes. Just my opinion.",startrek,1547159796,CineMike84,38,1,True,2019-01-10

For me it's TNG's ""The Perfect Mate"". I don't think this episode even registered as significant the first one or two times seeing it, but overtime it's moved squarely into my top 5 list. It's hard not to fall in love with Kamala right alongside Picard and feel the same pain he does every single time I watch. They couldn't have cast a more perfect actress in the role.  Famke Jansen is charming, adorable, sad, funny, and has fantastic chemistry with Patrick Stewart (and Riker, and Worf...). On top of the gutwrenching love story, it also poses difficult questions like the best of Star Trek does. Just so, so good from beginning to end (ignoring the stupidity of the Ferengi of course.)

Obviously Picard is there a whole lot of the time and Picard is too awesome of a captain so all eyes are always on him. 
Next you could also put Data in command of the ship since Data is again superior to Riker.

I know this is a weird question, since the federation is a defensive &amp; exploratory Interstellar civilization, but I needed to ask since 
I feel that they could be useful in situations where  
Starships,fighters and shuttles cannot interfere in planetary defense against enemy away teams or invasion force, this obviously would be hard, since  these armored vehicles would need to have a very advanced tech to stand against enemy particle beams and blasters, while having an equally powerful weapon like Phaser banks or even a photon torpedo(these are even harder since these weapons are fitted for Starships only, so it would either be a Huge tank, or a tank with the ultimate tech so it can do all these things.) So, unless the starships are unable to go to the planet for any reason, they would not serve much... At least they use hover-bikes and buggy's and jeeps.

4720,Just watched Star Trek: Discovery season 1 on iTunes and... meh.,"Note: *Lifelong Trek fan here, going back to TOS. I have watched every Star Trek series episode &amp; movie, most multiple times.*  


I just binge watched *Star Trek: Discovery* on iTunes this week, and I'm... underwhelmed.  
I chose not to subscribe to CBS All Access when it launched, and waited until *Discovery* became available for purchase on iTunes before watching it. I did not want to encourage CBS in their streaming venture -- I am subscribed to enough streaming services already, thank you -- and frankly, I didn't want to have to pay yet an another ongoing subscription fee just to re-watch episodes of one show. Also, I'm still sore over CBS' treatment of *Axanar*, *StarTrek Phase II*, and other fan productions.

So, I may be a little late to the *Discovery* party, but having watched the final episode of season 1 last night, with it fresh in my mind, I want to say: this show really wasn't as good as I had hoped.  
Let me start with what *Star Trek: Discovery* got right:

* Most of the production design is superb. The ship, the phasers, the communicators, the uniforms, transporter effect, warp drive... they all felt fresh, yet recognizable echoes of past *Trek* series. I definitely approve. And the new Mirror Universe design was exquisite!
* The opening title sequence is very nice. I like it, and though this title sequence is a departure from earlier iterations of *Trek*, the use of the TOS theme really does tie this series to the past. (And at least it doesn't have a dreadful pop theme song like ST:ENT.)
* Most of the characters are very enjoyable. I like Michael Burnham, and approve of a *Trek* show that doesn't focus on the captain as central character. I *really* like Saru -- he's the Starfleet character I enjoyed the most. Sylvia Tilly is delightfully real in her human uncertainties as a cadet. And Anthony Rapp's intense portrayal of Paul Stamets also get a thumbs up from me. Sadly, Captain Giorgiou wasn't around long enough for us to really get to know her -- the Empress Giorgiou doesn't count. 
* Same-sex relationships. About time a main character was in a long-term homosexual relationship.
* The ongoing storytelling arc format works fine, instead of being episodic. ST:DS9 really paved the way for long-form storytelling in *Trek*, and I have no problem with Discovery adopting this form.
* Rainn Wilson as Harry Mudd is brilliant. Though no one could ever replace the smarmy goofiness of Roger Carmel's 1960s version of the character, he's definitely a worthy successor in the role. Wilson's Mudd is more hard-edged and dangerous than the original, but that's OK. ""*Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad*"" was the first episode that actually ""felt"" like a *Star Trek* episode (it's a pity it took 7 episodes in to feel like I was actually watching *Trek*). This is far and away my favorite episode of the season -- and the only one I want to go back and watch again.

But there's a lot *Discovery* just didn't get right at all:

* The premise: *Another* prequel/reboot? Why are they so afraid of furthering the story of the Prime *Trek* Universe? The last three *Trek* incarnations have all gone *backwards* (ST:ENT, the JJ Abrams movies, and now *Discovery*), and all of them have been lacking in execution &amp; storytelling in one way or the other.  They aren't expanding *Trek*, they are just re-hashing it. This just is not what many *Trek* fans want to see -- and I think the viewership numbers reflect that. Why not set *Discovery* after ST:VOY &amp; *Nemesis*?
* The Klingon redesign: This is the 4th time Star Trek has redesigned the Klingon race's physical form, and it just felt *unnecessary*. While I appreciate that they kept the Klingon language and culture intact (for the most part), and I liked the redesigned uniforms, ships, and the absolutely amazing Ship of the Dead... I found myself wishing they had stopped there.  Designers, please stop messing with the Klingons' heads! 
* Spore Drive &amp; Mycelium Network connecting all life in the galaxy: WTF?!? This didn't feel like it fit into *Trek* at all. It was a complete departure, and really bothered me. There are way too many negative ramifications of this radical new technology for it to fit comfortably into established *Trek* lore.
* Mirror Universe: Though I don't have any problems with the concept per se -- and I appreciated the tie-ins to ST:TOS &amp; ST:ENT with the USS Defiant -- it felt a little too much of a B-story to squeeze into the first season, along with the main arc of the Klingon War. I think I would have appreciated the Mirror Universe storyline more if it had been a stand alone storyline in the second season.
* Klingon War: Design issues aside, this is where the storytelling really went off-track. The Voq/Ash storyline felt forced, and the end of the war felt very rushed. The last two episodes are a mess. They terraformed a Veda system moon with the fungi in just a few minutes? And then spore jumped the ship INTO a cave Q'onos? No no no no no. Just no. The ending, with L'Rell uniting the Klingon Empire with her threat of destroying the Klingon Homeworld? I just wasn't buying it, that she would actually carry out her threat. It all felt so shoehorned.

Here's hoping that *Discovery*, like so many Star Trek series before it, improves with the second season.   
But I won't be watching *Discovery* on CBS All Access. I'll be waiting until season 2 is available on iTunes.

4733,Nice detail in Star Trek IV,"I am a Star Trek Fan since forever, and I probably have watched each movie ten times within my life (I am 35 years old). To show my girlfriend the movies we watched Star Trek IV last night, in which they search the whales. And there is a nice little detail I have never seen before. 
It started with Kirk asked Gillian Taylor to have dinner together, so that he could dig more details from her about when the whales would be transported, etc. But before they could eat their pizzas, Kirk had to leave and Gillian mentioned to bring the food with them. She then drove Kirk to the park. 
Then comes the scene: Kirk got out of the car hold one Pizza in his hands. And this is what I have never recognized before in all the other times I watched this movie, but my girlfriend immediately pointed it out. It is a funny little detail in my opinion, which shows that Kirk is actually very goal-oriented and put his ships’ interesst in the first place: he got the information he wanted, and still wouldn’t forget about his share of the pizza, which he didn’t even pay for!!! His behaviour here shows the attitude he owns in the completely three seasons of TOS. 
One take-away hint: it is very interesting to see it through a girl‘s perspective - what women expect from a date the moment they agreed to go out with a guy. Don’t do it like Kirk. ",startrek,1543761427,TonyLeung82,51,1,True,2018-12-02

4737,Met my childhood hero in October,"So like many of you fine people I’ve been a lifelong fan of Star Trek. In particular I’ve always been a fan of the engineers of Starfleet. 

I watched Star Trek TNG during its original run while I was a small child. I remember being mesmerized by this huge ship flying through space and meeting scary looking aliens (again I was a small child.) I also thought it was really cool that the guy who would talk to me about reading would show up on TNG and mess about with all this cool future tech I’d never be allowed to play with. All while wearing a hair clip over his face!

Geordi LaForge was my gateway into the StarFleet Corps of Engineers. Watching him taught me how cool technology was and how cool it was to be able to fix it yourself. 

Now I fix computers and radios for the Canadian Army and have Star Trek stuff all over my desk. Still hunting for a LaForge pop vinyl but it will be mine!

For now I’ll happily settle with having [met my childhood hero in person](https://i.imgur.com/EML6Dg5.png) at a local con at the end of October and having drinks with him at the social event the night before and listening to him talk about how his Wikipedia page is full of lies lol.

4750,"Was Trelain from TOS S1:18 ""The Squire of Gothos"" a Q? or possibly a younger version of The Q?","Trelain:

- Has a fascination with earth
- enjoys toying with humans
- Is seemingly all powerful (he does have that generator in the palace but I suspect that could have been a tool to make up for lacking the total power of the species since he was young)
- Apparently made the planet he was on
- Is horribly unemphatic, and sees humans as being below him, but is fascinated by them

The character we see, and later on his parents, follow a very distinctly Qish pattern. Specifically with Trelain he seems like The Q from TNG. While the time that passes between TNG and TOS is infinitesimally small for a Q, time is somewhat irrelevant for a Q. The Q Picard meets in TNG could be thousands or hundreds of thousands of years older than the one that Kirk encounters if Q simply latched onto Picard at that particular point in his life. 

The way that Trelain toys with the crew of the Enterprise is very reminescent of some of the actions Q will take with Picard, and the way his parents chew him out is very reminiscent of the Q continuum and how it treats Q in Voyager. ",startrek,1543810705,Goldeniccarus,21,1,True,2018-12-02

4757,Voyager movie plot [Long],"Ive seen this type of Voyager movie plot more than once: The heist. This has been done before in Star Trek III, and I think the reason for the movie has also been done: Seven of Nine has been kidnapped by the Borg. 

I cant think of any ""Arch enemy"" like the Klingons, Q, or any regular enemy for Janeway and Voyager other than the Borg. The Borg Queen might be dead, but that doesnt mean the Borg doesn't want to re-assimilate Seven.

This story might sound identical to a Best of Both worlds, but Voyager has to travel back to the Delta Quadrant to retrieve Seven. 

Theres a few ways to do it: Barclay finds message on the Midas array, and its from the Borg Conciousness, when Barclay learns that Seven has been kidnapped by identifying one of her Borg implants in the ""borg cloud"".

OR, a borg drone is accidentaly used to tap into the borg conciousness and a message from Axum in unimatrix zero is used to tell someone in starfleet loyal to Janeway that Seven is missing, etc OR just use a direct distress call from her.

Janeway needs a way to get back to the Delta Quadrant, which can be approached a number of ways as well:

Shes been demoted and/or still captains a ship, shes a retired admiral and with the help of Harry Kim- has to steal Voyager from a starbase or shipyard, or a combination of both. Janeways demotion could be an interesting ""Act 1"" if dramatic enough, similar to Kirk's in Star Trek 4.

Janeway then has to reassemble the rest of her crew by various means.
Voyager uses borg technology or the slipstream drive to return to the delta quadrant in search of seven of nine. 

What happens after that I am not sure, but it can be unoriginal such as Voyager being destroyed in the Delta quadrant, and the crew has to find another way home, or something silly like using the ferengi wormhole, leaving them stranded again, etc.

How does this story end or not end?

4760,Voyager Movie plot [long],"Instead of re-using the stale old borg/time travel delta quadrant plots, I accidentally found it more interesting to have a Voyager movie plot centered around stealing Voyager in the Alpha quadrant.

I don't mean stealing Voyager from a star-base or shipyard, as star trek 3 already did.

Instead its Janeway, having discovered her precious ship has been taken by aliens, decides to re-assemble her crew to retake Voyager from the Sona (or other enemy)

True, why cant any of the other series do this? I feel its because Voyager was a unique ship, has a more technologically diverse crew, and Voyager doesn't have a movie.

Voyager plots could do better if they weren't centered around the ""getting home"" narrative, since that problem has been solved anyways, we need a reason for the voyager crew to come back together. 

The other idea is that Seven has been kidnapped by the borg, but felt that is a worn out story. An alpha quadrant themed plot would do a lot to raise Voyagers profile in the star trek universe.

With Patrick Stewart coming back, I don't see why Kate Mulgrew can't to star in a TV or box office movie. 

It would also be interesting to get Seth MacFarlane to produce a star trek movie, hes a natural choice to guide star trek into the future and is sort of the only one out there star trek fans can really trust with the series anymore.

4782,"""We can't leave! This is our home!""","Watching A TNG episode ; ""Masterpiece Society"" where: a space thing is going to cause seismic disruptions that will kill everyone on a colony world, shortly after seeing ""Ensigns of Command"" where: the Federation cannot prevent a diplomatically protected alien race from obliterating the inhabitants of a colony world. 

I've seen this in other episodes. A colony never agrees to a first offer of evacuation for any reason ever. They are going to certainly die, they are told so, they believe the information, yet.

\- The biodome that protects your colony will certainly be destroyed to cause your extinction? no

\- another heavily armed species will exterminate all of you? no

\- You will be annexed by an authoritarian empire? no

\- an energy field prevents any electrical technology from functioning?; and, mind you: you are originally a people raised on 24th century technology and you can't even run a toaster. no. no? really?

\- everyone in the village were actually holographic simulations, and, you are the only organic being on the planet. If the generator breaks again, you will have no companionship, medical care, housing, or, anyone to help you after we leave? no. 

\- your dying from radiation? - your dying from planet borne pathogens? -Your dying from lack of a necessary resource? -We will shoot you with our fucking space guns if you don't get on the ship right now? 

The frustration is a two way street. On one hand: the Federation is well known as massively powerful and massively benevolent, and, the choice to hop to and GTFO when they say should be an easy one, especially considering a known previous history of how colony worlds can fail disastrously, they should be grateful that they got advanced warning of possible trouble and a chance to avoid/prevent it.

On the other hand: Federation citizens are supposed to have a good deal of liberty , and, the hero ship should simply accept their refusal and leave them to their fates. The refusal of evacuation or help may be a face measure to a point; knowing that the Federation will persist in rescue: no one wants to be the weenies who caved immediately, but, the tough sumbitches that they had to drag out kicking and screaming. If the Federation adapted a policy of accepting the first refusal, future evacuations may be met with less delaying protest. ",startrek,1543900319,zoyathedestroyah,19,1,True,2018-12-04

Now don't get me wrong, he is a competent tactician and shows he can take the responsibilities of a security chief, and he is somewhat capable as a politician... but he's so awfully inflexible in his thought. He's stuck with stereotypes and very rigid categories. He doesn't consider that social categories tend to be fluid (like every time an artificial person proves their personhood he just claims they're an exception). It takes him twelve years of Star Trek series to even think about how Klingon society could be flawed, and it takes his reincarnated ex to remind him of the possibility. Speaking of Dax: His fury at her having had relationships before their marriage speaks volumes. I understamd he's a very traditional man who hasn't had contact to his ""native"" culture until his mid-twenties, and I see this happening IRL with Turkish and Arabic youth in my country who STRICTLY refuse to accept any concept of a society outside the strictest interpretations of the Quran not despite, but because they've never been in the middle east themselves, and there are many smart people among them. What confuses me is how a guy like Worf could have been considered Starfleet material by *anyone*. He's too restricted by his ideology, and while he proves a worthwhile relations officer with the Klingon Empire, his... now intolerance is the wrong word... his extremely strict understanding of the relation between a culture and the individuals existing within it would usually be expected to be harmful to a federation that *lives* from being *nothing but* that relation.",startrek,1543946828,Onechordbassist,10,1,True,2018-12-04

4812,My obsession with Earl Grey tea...,"TL;DR: I fell in love with Earl Grey Tea thanks to a certain Star Trek captain. 

&amp;#x200B;

It all began soon after I finished marathoning TNG. I was sitting one early morning at the kitchen table, staring out my high-rise apartment window. My little sister was getting something out of the fridge, and asked me nonchalantly, ""Do you want a drink?"" I was totally blanking out, and was extremely surprised when I muttered out loud, 

""Earl Grey, hot."" I was stunned in surprise, while my sister glanced at me like I was an idiot (which I am), and said, ""Wha?""

As I began to realize what I just said, the echo in my head grew louder and louder. The voice of a certain captain, calling out to his trusty replicator. 

My sister, still bent over into the fridge, scratched her head in visible confusion and murmured, ""Earl what?"" 

I ignored her, and rushed over to our overhead cabinet where we stored all our tea and coffee. I searched desperately for Earl Grey, but of course no sane Asian family actually buys Earl Grey tea. I clicked my tongue in frustration, and went over to the balcony and started setting a reminder on my phone to buy some on the way home from school. My little sister's head was tilted in complete confusion, and kept mumbling in futility to me (mostly to herself) in Korean, ""What did you say? Earl what? Big bro?"" 

When I brought home three cases of Earl Grey tea bags that afternoon, I put it on the kitchen counter and realized I didn't even like tea. I'd never even smelled or drank Earl Grey before. But I made a hot cup of it, and stared at it for a good minute. It was more fragrant than I'd imagine it'd be, and I was a bit hesitant to drink the dark liquid. But realizing that I bought three cases of this stuff, I gulped my first sip of it. 

I gotta say that at first, I was not a fan of it, not one bit. It was strange and somewhat bitter, almost like coffee with too much water. But I forced myself to finish the cup. Then, I had another. The next day, I had another cup. The day after that, I put Earl Grey into a thermos and brought it to school, and my friends stared at me like I was an idiot (which I am). One of them asked me, ""Do you even enjoy drinking it?"" I had no answer for him, and shrugged. 

It's been almost two months now, and I've had Earl Grey tea at least once per day. I'm not sure what it is, but it feels as if I'm somehow channeling the spirit of Captain Picard whenever I lift up a cup full of that stuff. I've gotten totally used to it, and admittedly have become somewhat full of myself. Now, whenever either of my little sisters asks me if I want a drink, I say with in a voice dripping with gravitas, ""Tea, Earl Grey, hot."" 

Of course, my sisters aren't actually replicators, and since they don't really get my obsession with the drink (which I don't fully understand either), they either ignore me, tell me to get it myself, or ask me why tea would not be hot, which makes me wonder why they even asked me in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, as I write this post, I lift this cup of Earl Grey to you Captain Picard. Thank you for helping me develop an unhealthy obsession with a drink I never would have consumed under any other circumstance. ",startrek,1543978874,TheBigSmol,26,1,True,2018-12-04

4814,How to Win the Federation-Klingon War of 2256...,"OK! For those that don't know, I'll save you your time, in Discovery we see the Klingons steamrolling starfleet at every engagement, and by the end of the first year, I'd say about 90% of federation space has been lost. I'm not just pulling this out of my ass, look at the beginning of the war starfleet had around 40 or so highlighted planets, which by the end where reduced to 4. For this I will be taking command of Starfleet, and note- I am not a military tactician, what I say most likely won't be the best way of doing things, but I know my Trek, and I know how Klingons work. And some of the stuff I say may actually be what they did, or tried in continuity, so bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets assume I take command 1 month after the battle of the Binary Stars, the first thing I would order is the mass-mining of unused, or minimally used planets, astroids, moons, whatever, and use the resources on said planets to construct as many top of the line star-ships as possible, such as the Crossfield-Class, and I would delay, or cancel the construction of older starfleet ships, say the Walker-Class.

The very next thing to do is to find a way to by-pass the cloaking-- I'm sorry ""Invisibility Screens"" of the Klingons, and I would relay Shoot-On-Sight orders to Federation ships on Klingon warships, as for cargo transports, seize them, and the crew- if they are willing to surrender, if not- let them enjoy the coldness of space, this goes for disabled warships as well-- Ok, something else, I LOVE the klingons in discovery, it took me a while to get used to the re-designs, I still am not used to them, but the are treated as scary fighters, and brutal soldiers, I never thought I'd say this- but, hats off to you Discovery writers... for once... But in order to have a chance at winning this war, we can't take in every prisoner, we can't never attack non-military targets, we Protect the Federation 1st-- preventing Klingon civilian deaths is just icing on the cake.



I would also attempt to research into new weapons technologies, and propulsion methods, for example the spore drive will be our number 1 priority to research, and put on the front lines, the next will be being able to track cloaked ships, and researching into our own cloaking technology- preferably one that lets us fire with the cloak on.

Anyways- I would also command standing orders for a new fleet-reorinization program, task forces are led by the captain of the most advanced ship in the force, or by the chosen captain, usually ships would number from 3-5, Fleets would be led by rear admirals, and would have 5-10 ships, Battlefleets 10-25, Armadas 25-50, and home fleets would be required to have a minimum of 30 starships to defend the planet-- fun fact- Earth's home fleet conceded of about 10 ships... yeah- cuz the Federation's capital is worth very little if any defense.. god- damn it Discovery... And Generations...

Where was I? Oh- yeah, individual starships would be a rarity throughout the navy, only for recon, or extreme situations, some ships however, like the Cross field class will only be assigned to other ships of the same class, they can't work with other ships- they will only be slowed down. Cross-Field groups would usually be Task-force sized, 3-5 ships, and will be used for hit and run attacks only- only under desperate situations should they be considered to be used for anything other than hit and runs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the fighting itself, the first thing I would order is to attack dilithium mines, to leave their fleets grounded, or better- dead in space, and when that happens, we seize the vessel, and we turn their own weapon against them, we use cloaked minefields to destroy klingon ships, one procedure I would enact would be for a Federation starship, preferably a Crossfield class, so it can escape if the attempt fails, to be in the center of a cloaked minefield that is sphere shaped, along with dozens of cloaked starships, the ship would create false sensor images of the ship being dead in space, an requesting starfleet assistance. Klingons love themselves Federation prisoners, so it would seem like an easy target, as a, or multiple ships move in,  to the actual minefield, 1 of 2 things can occur, one, the ship(s) would impact on a mine, or detect it, and we would be forced to detonate it early, or two, the ship(s) gets in the center and we launch our trap, we would than de-cloak the mines ( They are calibrated to only target Klingon ships ) and the cloaked starships, to literally surround the klingons, and give them 2 choices- Surrender, or die... Most sane commanders would hopefully surrender, however those that are not willing to comply will be destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

And something about Klingons, there is one thing that drives them, the one thing that has kept them from killing everyone around them, honor- they demand, and worship honor like how the Feds worship the Prime Directive... But worse- somehow. So how do we destroy Klingon moral, and integrity? By defaming them, we would broadcast videos of Klingon ships surrendering, and--- this is one thing that will most likely have me put in a Federation prison as a war criminal, but we would use drugs to make the Klingon captains bow to the Federation, beg for leniency, this would not only ensure that after this war ends those Klingon captains will more than likely be killed by the Empire, but would also send a message to the empire--- their soldiers can, and will be broken.

&amp;#x200B;

Now- We won't completely destroy the Empire, I won't allow that--- Why waste valuable time, resources and lives doing something that will happen anyway? Say- After we take 25% of Klingon territory ( Hopefully assuming my plans worked ), we sue for peace, we could destroy the Empire, but that would take time and resources, instead we release all Klingon prisoners, excluding war criminals, who's lives will be broadcasted to the Klingons for as long as they live, to the Empire- hopefully, this would damage relations between the 24 houses, some wanting to continue the fight, some wanting peace, lets assume They opt for peace, now we got some houses who still got some fight left, who do they fight? The Federation, they would get destroyed with ease, and they know what happens to them if they surrender... Dishonor, the Romulans? They've done nothing in the war, attacking them would also be suicidal, the only opponent they have a chance at- are the other houses. Hopefully a Civil war will occur, and while it's happening, we- the Federation will watch it happen, and set up plants to invade the Klingons after the war's end, assuming there is am Empire left afterwords, the civil war most likely would cripple most houses, and completely annihilate others, so now- with ease, we can destroy whats left of the Klingon empire, or- they can surrender to us.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ok- saying this is out-there is an understatement, I spent a good hour of my life working on this... Take this with a few shakers of salt too, I'm assuming some of the best scenarios occur, the worst scenarios would leave the Federation worse off than the Klingons, so I do have some--- many holes in my plans, and I would like to hear what people think of my idea... Am I insane to think this will work? Does my plan hold some merit? Or is it somewhere in between. 



Again- I love the Klingons, the are probably my 3rd favorite faction in Trek, 1st Romulans, 2nd Dominion. I have nothing against them, this is what I believe is the best way to win the war- please tell me if I have done anything wrong.

I decided I'd watch Discovery and see how it went. I started Discovery back on 10/2/17. After a few episodes I realized I was lacking serious context and stopped watching Discovery on 11/14/17.

The next day I started watching Star Trek the Original Series. The first two seasons were pretty good and the third really felt like homework to finish. It took my awhile but I watched the entirety of TOS from 11/15/17 to 2/12/18. 

At that point, at the behest of a colleague, I paused and watched Star Trek Continues. While its not considered canon, it really did help fill the void between the end of Season 3 of TOS and ST:TMP. I was really impressed with the quality of the show and was sad tot see it go. Since I didn't watch those episodes on my Plex server I don't have exact dates but given that it was only a handful of episodes it couldn't have taken me long. Between the end of TOS and TNG was a period of four days. In that time I watched Continues and the 6 Star Trek movies with the original series cast. 

On 2/16/18 I started where I'd began my journey, with TNG. Season 1 was ok, 2 was better and each season seemed to increase in quality progressively. I did have some qualms about how neat and tidy some storylines seemed to be wrapped up (and quicker than they should have been) but overall I really enjoyed all of it. To be fair I skipped the episode where Crusher has a sexual encounter with a ghost (at the behest of many many people's advice). I finished the last episode of the last season of TNG on 5/11/18. I was honestly sad to see it go.

On 5/12/18 I started DS9. Now I had known DS9 existed but up until that point I'd never watched a single episode nor did I know anything about the plot or its characters (save Worf and O'Brien being holdovers from TNG). The first season of DS9 was like homework. There was some good episodes there but overall I felt it didn't really live up to the standard TNG had set before it. Season 2 was a little better but then something happened that I can't quite explain....I really got into it. I mean I legitimately began enjoying DS9 and everything about it. The show found its footing and I found myself really caring about the characters and storylines. One of the biggest advantages that DS9 had over TNG was they not only were allowed to, but they really took advantage of playing the long game. Relationships were slow burns. We got teased about the Dominion way before we ever got to see the Jem Hadar or before we knew who the founders were. I mean they really took their time and if there was a serious plot point it was given the time to be explored and truly dealt with. One of my biggest complaints about TNG was how quickly Picard seemed to go from being a Borg to being the Captain on the Enterprise again. No mention of Riker's demotion, no mention of what would have been months of debriefs at Starfleet HQ...nothing. Just a neat and tidy bow wrapped on the end of the season premier and that was it. DS9 had the time to deal with these types of heavy hitting plots and they took real advantage of it. 

I ended up finished DS9 on 8/10/18. When I was five episodes from the end I knew I didn't want it to be over. I was sad at the idea of losing these characters and their stories. I mourned preemptively and when the end came I really felt bad. I have since realized that DS9 is my favorite Trek and Captain Sisko is my favorite Captain. 

I begrudgingly moved onto Voyager on 8/10/18. I am now ten episodes from the end of season 6 of Voyager and can honestly say it probably doesn't deserve the hate it gets. That being said there are legitimate problems with the consistency of the writing, particularly with Captain Janeway. Equinox 2 was way outside of her character and even Year in Hell proved that she could keep to her ideals in an extended, hard fought battle. I honestly believe Chokotay should have relieved her of command and I don't know how the writers thought it was somehow magically ok that the two of them just go back to being buddies by the next episode. 

It has been a really long year. I am glad that I've taken the time to go back and watch the entire canon. Once I finish Voyager in the next couple of weeks I'll move on to Enterprise - another show I was aware of but have never seen before. I'm pretty excited to finish it all before Discovery season 2 begins next year. 

I just wanted to share my experiences. Its been a great year and I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of the journey. ",startrek,1544027927,RyoOfWildFire,0,1,True,2018-12-05

How does hugging one of those things bring the crew members back? Were the slugs the crew members in a data-corrupted form and then when they go into the stream the data is corrected? Did the microbes infect the crew members, merging them, leading to the microbe-humans appearing to be a giant version of the microbes and then when they go into the data stream they come out looking normal?

No clue what happened. It drives me insane because they NEVER EXPLAIN THIS. Not even the treknobabble hand-waving about being trapped in the data stream. And it's an otherwise good episode.

4837,My experience with Star Trek,"3 years ago, I started high school. I met two friends there that told me about Star Trek, and I decided to give it a chance. I watched the unaired pilot (The Cage), and I was horrified. However, my friends pushed me to give it a second chance. Today, I'm writing my college essay about Star Trek, and the reason why it is so close to me, and today I want to talk about that. It's one of those franchises that will always be close to my heart. I will never forget the moment I got hooked to the franchise. The TOS episode What are Little Girls Made Of was playing. It discusses the philosophical question ""if there's a clone that is exactly like you - has all your memories, emotions, thoughts, etc - is it you?"" I remember the moment I became intrigued. It was when I reached the TNG episode Measure of a Man. When I rewatched it, I realized I wanted to do advocacy work for ex-felons and people from US territories and that I wanted to teach in prisons. I remember the moment I found myself. It was when I saw the TNG episode Hollow Pursuits, and I fell in love with Barclay. I remember the moment I fell in love. It was when I saw the DS9 episode Heart of Stone, and all my fears about becoming a detective faded away.

I always was the outsider, but Star Trek made me love that about myself. The reason I'm telling you guys this today is because there's probably someone else today that is wondering whether or not to watch the franchise, and I just want to say it is 100% worth it. I owe the person I am today to those two friends that introduced me to Star Trek a little over three years ago.

4840,Be grateful for every Star Trek iteration that exists. Even if it isn't EXACTLY what you want.,"Let me start by saying I LOVE STAR TREK!!   I don't need to go into backstory because it's the same for so many of us.  Grew up with it as a kid, inspired us, entertained us, etc. 

After being on Reddit for the last couple years, I am just shocked at how many of Star Trek's own fans hate on it.  The people who are supposed to be supporting the show the most are the ones who hate it the most.  

It's ridiculous.  Juvenile. Short sighted.  Uncreative.  Unprogressive.  Intolerant(in a show that is supposed to push the limits of tolerance).  And just downright assholish. 

Do you detractors even realize how lucky you are to be experiencing Star Trek at all??   I mean, just the simple fact that you exist is huge.  But you could have existed at any point in human history and spent your life collecting coconuts to survive and wiping your ass with your hand every day.  Instead, you are graced with one of the most beautiful shows ever created, and all a bunch of people on here can do is whine and complain about it like they are somehow being WRONGED.  

""Its not canon!!""   You know what??  Everytime anyone makes another episode, its instantly canon.  No matter what your personal blog claims with its heavy traffic of 14 users, 2 of which are your mom and uncle.  

Each creator of this show is doing their absolute best.  And different people have different ideas.  Its not like Trek is written by some magical being in the sky and these studio writers and producers are corrupting that information, while keeping the good story for themselves.  

But that's exactly how a bunch of you guys on all these star trek subs act like.  

I am sick and tired of all this divisiveness in the star trek world.  

Be grateful that you have Trek gracing your eyeballs and mind for the short time you are in this earth.  

Next time you feel like criticizing something that has given millions of people emotions and experiences you will never comprehend, just STFU.  Because none of us who really live star trek, in whichever version we like, want to hear it. 

All it dies is diminish our own personal experiences with the show, most of which are beautiful. All in some asinine attempt for you to prove how alpha you are in your life by proving one trek was better than another and shamelessly hating on any version that isnt up to your high standards.  

So next time a new season of trek comes on, dont criticize the cuisine before it is served, and remember that there are more people out there than just you that take satisfaction and are making NEW memories with their own kids with the new shows.  And all you are doing is diminishing the same emotions and experiences you and your dad or uncle or mother or brother or whoever.....had with star trek when you were growing up.

I know I'm going to spend at least $200 or more to get one in good condition, and that's fine.

I don't really care about the box, but I do want the ship complete and functioning.  Yellowed plastic is not an issue so much, as I'm considering painting it to more closely resemble the actual filming model.

This is primarily why I don't want to spend TOO much on the initial purchase!

4876,Star Trek: Flux,"EXT: USS Rhode Island, Nova class starship

VO: Space. For centuries, Starfleet called it the final frontier. Some of the greatest captains to wear the uniform - Kirk, Sulu, Picard - dedicated their lives to searching out the mysteries of our universe. My own captain, my first assignment, was the deepest of deep space missions. And yet a new frontier is opening up. 

INT: Harry Kim, seated, leaning in chair. 

KIM: Temporal shielding status?

VO: They say time exists to keep everything from happening at once. A river flowing from the mountains to the sea. But as our understanding of Temporal mechanics grows...

OPS: Shields are holding sir!

VO: We found the river has eddies. Undercurrents. The flow of time can be dammed, diverted, converged. Sped up and slowed down. And just like the salmon that swims upstream...

EXT: An old Federation starship appears from an impressive burst of light

VO: There are those who travel against the current of time.

KIM: Attention Federation vessel. You have entered an alternate timeline. Reverse course immediately. 

VIEWSCREEN: man, heavily injured, torn gold tunic

MAN: Please help us! My name is -

KIM: Cut transmission and jam their transmitter. Tactical, use the tractor beam to push them back. Helm, ahead one quarter impulse until they've passed back through the rift. 

VO:  Whether someone travels upstream or down, their absence creates a flux. Corrected swiftly, the river of time flows as it should and life goes on. Get it wrong...

EXT: Old Federation vessel lashes out with blue phasers and a handful of torpedoes. The rift begins to close. A massive Borg construct begins to appear, caging a nearby planet and turning it a sickly color. Alerted, cubes begin to approach the two Starfleet vessels, becoming more solid as they draw closer. 

KIM: They never listen, do they?

FIRST OFFICER: Today's not your day. 

These are the voyages of the USS Rhode Island. We are part of Starfleet's newest branch. Our mission: to research temporal anomalies and prevent their misuse. To preserve the flow of time as we know it. To explore the new frontier. ",startrek,1544155043,thx712517,7,1,True,2018-12-06

i've always loved the hell out of that little conversation.  and then I was having a discussion about why Borg ships are so powerful... how they basically take the best of each race they assimilate in their quest for perfection. And then I realised that's how the Federation have such relatively powerful ships compared to races that have been space faring for far longer.

They do exactly what the Borg do... just with diplomacy and healthcare.  :p

I did a quick search, seeing if anyone had had this conversation; didnt find anything but i did find a lot of people wondering what a Mirror Universe Borg would be like.  i'm not really one for really deep contemplation of the moral and philisophical differences/similarities between the Federation and the Borg  (i do think this warrants a solid ttalk though!) so the Mirror talk sent me down a different train of thought.

Now i know we have the meme of the mirror-verse just being goatees and sexytimes... but what if we never met the Borg as we did; that they never existed in our universe like they do.

What if the Borg were actually the Mirror Federation?

Could you imagine Picard coming face to face with Locutus?

___

**Short Trek 3 - The Brightest Star**

* Obviously the nature of this episode means this will be a short list. There really aren't any *references* per se.
* I'm not immediately certain whether there has ever been another episode set entirely on a planet with no scenes in space. ""Living Witness"" technically fits the description although it depicts space in holodecks.
* A warp-capable people exploiting or subjugating a pre-warp species is not a new idea in Trek. Both the Klingons and the Kazon have been victims of slavery in the past. The Romulans control the Remans (assuming the Remans are not also related to the Vulcans, which was never established). The two Ferengi lost in the Delta Quadrant in ""The Price"" eventually established themselves as rulers of the Takarian society in ""False Profits."" And whatever the origins of Vaal, it was most definitely controlling the society of the primitive people in ""The Apple.""
* The Kelpiens and their homeworld are visually reminiscent of Nibiru from *Into Darkness.*
* A pre-warp being communicating with a Starfleet officer is examined from the other side with Sarjenka and Data in ""Pen Pals."" In that episode the Prime Directive was applied such that Sarjenka's people were saved but Sarjenka's memories were wiped; in this episode the opposite occurred, with Saru being saved but his people's situation ignored.
* Giorgiou is wearing a DIS-era uniform. We know Saru was in Starfleet for at least seven years before the beginning of the series, so assuming he went through Starfleet Academy after being rescued, this episode must take place no later than the early 2240s, pushing the adoption of the uniform to before that time. The Kelvin crew of 2233 wore uniforms more in line with TOS, but DIS is already overlapping with that style.
* The idea of adopting a member of a pre-warp culture is also not new, having been seen or offered in episodes like ""First Contact,"" ""Homeward,"" and in a way STIV. This is the first time that the Prime Directive has been spelled out to say that you can take a being off their planet but can't return them.

**Oddities**

* The Kelpiens appear to be a hard-luck case. In the Mirror Universe, they're also a hard-luck case. Typically the MU flips things around, so you'd expect them to be the rulers of the galaxy.
* So the Kelpiens are harvesting...kelp? I'll assume that was a cute little joke.",startrek,1544185631,Antithesys,5,1,True,2018-12-07

Can anyone explain why the Federation simply didn't generate highly advanced kinetic weapons to fight against the Borg with? Even if they may not be effective in ship to cube fighting (which I'm assuming they still would be) the Borg soldiers certainly wouldn't be able to adapt to kinetic firepower.

With their ability to adapt neutralized they would essentially become slow moving targets that federation soldiers should easily be able to mop up.

4935,Masks is an amazing episode. I'll prove it to you.,"This was going to be a reply regarding least favorite episodes in defense of one of my favorites but I got so into it I would up writing a dissertation.

 Masks is an absolutely fantastic episode. It's actually one of my favorite episodes, which makes it all the more surprising that people consider it their least favorite. The only problem I have with the episode is the fact that somehow Picard, Troi, and Worf don't figure out that Masaka and Korgano represent the sun and the moon. They had the sun thing figured out soon enough, after a few mentions of Korgano ""pursuing"" Masaka you'd think Picard would have gotten it. I propose that Masks is not o lunes one of the best TNG episodes but also one of the best episodes in any Star Trek series, ever.

The best thing about the story is that involves a long-dead civilization and their creation myth, and possibly also their destruction myth. I'll revisit that second part later, but it's really interesting how this episode takes a look at what we can assume is an ancient creation myth and its importance to the cultural identity of whatever people the archive represented. It's also really cool how, after dying out as much as a hundred million years ago, the technology was there to re-form matter in order to lay the stage for anyone who encounters it to experience their culture in such a uniquely hands-on way. Of course it should be noted that we only get to actually interact with their people through Data, so was this actually unintentional or did their society historically include androids, or what? There's a lot of fascinating things to think about here that aren't really addressed, which is what really elevates a great Trek episode.

That brings us to my mention of the destruction myth. There are some things Data's personalities say that to me seem to suggest that part of this living story is to communicate how the world of these people was ending. There was mention of how it was getting harder to keep a flame going, how cold it was, and how ""Masaka sent the others away."" Could it be that their planer's  star was burning out, leading to longer nights, drastic climate change, disruption in gravitational forces in their system, and a slow but inevitable demise that both rekindled this obviously advanced society's interest in their ancient mythology as well as prompted them to construct and deploy this  array? I'd say probably so!!

One other thing I'll mention before I go is that ita great to see Picard put his anthropology expertise to use. The situation calls for someone with an archaeology background and we're just so lucky that the captain himself fits the bill. It's always nice to see a character apply their tertiary and/or adjunct skills to service the plot, especially when the results are as fantastical as Masks.",startrek,1544328800,NoSkeletonsAllowed,22,1,True,2018-12-08

4952,Were Unimatrix Zero 1 and 2 (VOY S06E26-S07E01) considered good or bad episodes for Voyager?,"I am nearing the end of my time with Voyager after my first run through of the series. I watched Unimatrix Zero (1 and 2) and am still chewing on it. In my mind I can't honestly decide if they were good or bad episodes. 

One of my chief complaints about TNG has always been that Picard and his experience with the Borg were not impactful at all. There was A LOT going on - Riker gets promoted and does a fine job in the Captain's chair, Picard is lost, found and brought back to life (so to speak), Riker takes a demotion and Picard gets his chair back....all in the matter of two episodes. There was so much wasted potential to tell intriguing stories and to show that Picard's experiences with the Borg actually changed things. Its something DS9 did very well that TNG never did...it played the long game with storytelling.

Fast forward to Unimatrix Zero and I'm again filled with the sense that the assimilation of B'Elanna, Tuvok and Janeway meant NOTHING. They added no depth to their characters, they didn't struggle with any residual effects, hell they even got to (conveniently) get all their borg implants removed while Seven still has to keep the fancy mechanical eyebrow on her face as a constant reminder. Hell even Ichep has residual implants on his face yet the three members of the Voyager crew who were assimilated had no external reminders of their experiences. 

There are other problems I saw with the episodes but overall I wasn't terribly displeased with them....just not pleased. It got me thinking to ask what (if any) the general consensus was surrounding these episodes around these hallowed halls.

I've got about 22 episodes left to watch and I'll be ready to start Enterprise (another I have never seen before). Once I finish Enterprise I may go back for another round at Deep Space Nine since I miss it so much.",startrek,1544401594,RyoOfWildFire,19,1,True,2018-12-09
4953,Do you think the producers regret not creating a Pike show from the beginning instead of making Discovery?,"Lets be honest, no matter how people feel about Discovery, a new cast just doesn't bring the attention and fan fare like a set of known characters do (hence the excitement over the Picard show). And looking at the reaction to seeing the Enterprise appear at the end of the season finale and now all the attention to Pike and Spock next season I'm starting to wonder if that was just the smarter way to go on day one?

It could not only be a way to bring back the Enterprise with a young Spock, it could then be a direct prequel to TOS. Since the show would take place several years after The Cage, they could also put anyone they wanted on the ship crew wise. Imagine a young Scotty showing up in season two or Ensign Sulu joining in season three. It would feel like a nice progression since we know so little about TOS characters prior to being on the Enterprise. And the thing is it also doesn't stop new characters like a Saru or Tilly being on the same ship (assuming they were created for this show).

I mostly say this because its clear DIS is being used as a back door show to squeeze as many TOS characters as possible. Pike and Spock are basically part of the cast next season. We know its to drive up AA subs but I'm betting many just wish they went that way on day one and then they could throw in whatever fan service they wanted. Or am I wrong?

I was just thinking that without experiencing typical earthling humanoid emotions, that the earthling sociopath would be the closest thing there is to a typical Vulcan; emotions being suppressed &amp; perhaps allowing more logical characteristics to be emphasized. 

TLDR: since we share a common lineage, the earthling sociopath is the closest thing to a typical Vulcan.

4960,Would Wesley Crusher's character have been better if they wrote him as a regular teenager like Jake Sisqo and Mog instead of a wiz kid?,"For one having the teenager start off as a wiz kid they have no room to grow. Their character is already stagnated at the upset. And it also seems arrogant how Wesley doesn't have the same limitations really young people have even if they're gifted at something.

Take Jake's talent for writing. When he's doing his beat as a journalist he acts really stupid and arrogant because of the euphoria caused by doing something exciting and a lack of experience that makes him unable to act properly. So he acts really abrasive questions that turn off the people he's interviewing and comes off like a jackass kid. That's relatable. And we the audience still know he's a good person, but he's stupid enough for his character arc to be believable.

Or how much earned it felt for Mog to get a Star Fleet uniform compared to Wesley. We got to see him go from troublemaker, to inspiring star fleet cadet, to a new soldier that's believably under the weight of his circumstances. Once again a sympathetic and engaging arc. Unlike Wesley.

4974,Happy Holidays VR Trekkers! Here is an update to my STAGE 9 VR Game Mod Project: it is going VERY WELL!," Stage 9 VR Mod update: 

 I have updated and optimized all 1000+ Textures for the game individually.     Many maps such as 'Eyeball Bump' were a whoppping 4096x4096 (times 5 other maps, times 21 characters...)     I guesstimated how big each map would likely get onscreen ingame and resized them accordingly, the eye bump maps going to 256x256, while detail hungry surfaces such as the Enterprise D external hull bump map, remains at 4096 etc.  I have done a lot of work on the Character Maps,. They are a LOT smoother now, no weird shadows and dark skin splotches,.. I am seriously thinking about replacing rthe characters with a better looking group! 

The hair models Scragnogs' crew did is surprisingly good, I will see what I can do with th heads, also, the body is very,. average,  a Starship should be 'Manned' by elite studs..  I think I will do an all Female Crew Mod too (With ...hmm,  Maybe 7 of 9 in the Captains Ready Room LOL! Really! )     Today, I am starting optimizing all the MESHES in the VR game.  I have found items with components that should be SINGLE Polygons (with 2 faces &amp; 4 vertices...)  that instead have thousands of vertices! Objects with a million vertices, but when I tell it to simply weld all vertices that are nearly overlapping, within a 10/th of a Centimeter tolerance, the count can go as low as 37,000!  This I think will all make a GIANT change in how well the VR game plays!   

Today I am optimizing DS9 ( (it is a really heavy mesh), I am using the 3ds Max Render to Surface tool, to create Concavity and Mesh Density maps, these I use in Photoshop, to output Texture, Specularity, Metallicity,  NORMAL and Opacity maps, to replace details on DS9 that could just be in the mapping (such as most of the thousands of windows!) instead of the  3D mesh which is much more computationally expensive!  I will finish optimizing, test, fix any problems I created then I will make a new video on my channel, about all the changes I made, along with a single file MOD that when Unzippe'd into the Stage 9 0.0.91 VR game folder will: 1) Take away the Santa Hats, 2) Update and Optimize everything in the game 3) leave behind the tools and importers so you can (w/ free copies of Unreal, Blender etc) make it your own! (I will also by then, make a video about how to use the tools to mod the characters etc.)  I wonder how long until there is an Enterprise D all female (or male) Nude mod. (For Luaxanna's Wedding of course...) 4)  Then I will ake all the resources I have rebuilt, optimized (and added any additional real-world detail too!) I will start to add to it enormously.  I will be adding everything i can think of. 

I want this to be Star Trek the VR Universe,.  I call it:  PROJECT HOLODECK.   

By 2023 I will have recreated all the TNG episodes not as VIDEO, but as HOLODECK VR Adventures.  Using AI to recreate the crew as CGI, acting out the episodes, IN VR (Realtime as a VR APP)  with all the nuances of their original performances in each episode, perfectly intact, just,.  Interpreted  by AI so it is a 3D Photo-realistic VR Person, in front of you,  and if you walk around behind, you can see, the back of the head'.  AI could be used to 'see' how each person looks from every angle,  recreate that as a VR person, then their performance in each episode to guide the VR character, (including an algorithm that looks at the character when they are not speaking and uses an amalgam of that, to 'guide' the VR character when they are between lines or scenes! Give them 'motivation' (Picard working on Archaeology, Beverly going over file sand doing experiments with Moss, Dr Polasky squirming in the small box they locked her into in the Cargo bay after Season 2),  You get it right? You can be anywhere in the room during an episode, YOU can decide when to leave the room to go to the Transporter to beam down for the mission  (oh!  And I will add in things that happen if you don't follow the story LOL  Ship explodes or go to BRIG LOL :)  We will be a part of the TNG Episodes!  (See, we will have all the performance in each episode, intact, just,.  INTERPRETED by AI and the 'back of the head' (filled in (So you can performance in each episode, intact, just,.  INTERPRETED by AI.  

&amp;#x200B;

NOW GO ONE STEP FURTHER: (2026)  WE have an AI that has analyzed HUNDREDS OF HOURS of Each Actors Voice, Their quirks, their reactions, their vocal quality and acting, also, what type of sounds effects play when what happens, what type of music plays, when, what ever happens,.  ----&gt;   I believe we could use this info, Deep Data and AI, to simply TYPE NEW LINES and the AI will output what we type, as STAR TREK TNG.  The way we expect to see it and hear it. But with COMPLETELY NEW Stories, Endless Stories!   We can already use AI recreate a person VISUALLY,  Also to perfectly emulate their voice, make them say things they never said,.. It's only one more small step to analyze and emulate reactions and mannerisms.     There is no reason not to think AI and Quantum Computing is already capable of doing what I have outlined.

We would have Season 8, even season 18.  We could hang out on Ds9, multi-player style, and go to Quark's and talk to the AI Quark or the AI Rom.  Someone is going to do this.  SO it may as well be me. (Us? :) 

   (PS: NONE OF THIS is mean to reflect poorly on Scragnog or any of the extended crew, their work or abilities! I HAVE NO NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ORIGINAL CREW,  THEY HAD NOT STARTED OPTIMIZING YET!  I Totally understand the way things come together: When one is in the creative phase, they don't always want to deal with the with technical stuff yet...,  ,.  I just happen to have 30 years experience in game development and I can't not optimize when I see a thing so potentially cool, left abandoned (through no fault of) the creators,.  you see?  So all l possible LOVE TO THE Scragonator,.  THANK YOU to him, and them, for giving me something to deconstruct, perfect, re-construct and eventually remake entirely as multi-player open source etc etc!!!    THIS IS FUN!

4976,John Eaves Star Trek Design Work.,"Last night I bought the concept art book, Star Trek: The Art of John Eaves from my local bookstore.

I noticed something. His design work is so far...timeless. If you look at Star Trek designs throughout the decades, we may love the stuff, but you have to objectively admit, it looks dated for modern TV show/Movie aesthetics. 

TOS looks massively dated, TMP slightly less so, but still really 70ish, TNG is already starting to look dated, but most Voy/DS9/ENT stuff holds up fine.

I notice that John Eaves first Star Trek projection was The Final Frontier. He designed a shuttlecraft that wasn't ultimately used, but the design could be dropped into a modern TV show or movie and work just fine unaltered. From 1989. 

If we had never seen it before, his Enterprise-E from First Contact would look fine right in a 2019 feature film other than the CRT monitors on the bridge, but that's more a set construction issue than his bridge design.

As I looked through the book, I may not like all of his designs, but I do like most of them. But the fact remains, they look modern and sleek and what you'd expect to see for current design aesthetics, and he was ahead of the curve 30 years ago!

* No clear, specific roles.
* No work-life balance.

* Unitary leadership team, motivated only by material gain and power.
* Sick building syndrome.

Clear signs of Starfleet workplace toxicity:

* Unpredictability.
* Power politics, specifically infighting and breakaway by force and fraud (Section 31, Benjamin Maxwell, the Maquis). A lot of them are lucky not to have been killed by witting and deliberate friendly fire. I'm surprised there is not money or more political corruption in the Federation, IMO this is nearing USSR-like or Tito-like proportions.

4979,"The Star Trek licensing situation isn't as simple as ""CBS = Prime timeline"" and ""Paramount = Kelvin timeline""","I've been seeing a lot of speculation recently about the new Picard show and whether or not it's going to integrate the Hobus supernova into the setting. A common refrain in some of these threads takes this form:

&gt; CBS is going to ignore the supernova because that's JJ *Trek* which is owned by Paramount, not CBS. Contractually, CBS can't reference anything from the Kelvin timeline movies.

I'm not a lawyer, but given the evidence available to me I am pretty sure that this is totally false. Exhibit A: *Star Trek: Fleet Command,* a mobile game on both iOS and Android which is [licensed by CBS](https://scopely.com/blog/scopely-and-cbs-interactive-team-for-star-trek-fleet-command/) but is [definitely set in the Kelvin timeline](https://i.imgur.com/TW9i9XQ.jpg). I played the game for a bit and it's definitely a mix of Kelvin timeline and Prime timeline lore.

I'm pretty sure that both CBS and Paramount hold a license to produce and authorize the creation of *Star Trek* works. Maybe the license authorizes Paramount to make movies and CBS to make everything else, but it seems like that's the extent of it. It doesn't seem like it goes as far to stipulate minutiae like ""CBS must use the Shatner likeness of Kirk while Paramount must use the Pine likeness.""

That said, the idea of expensive lawyers in a fancy conference room doing real deep dives on *Star Trek* canon is pretty amusing to me.

So in summary, there doesn't appear to be a legal reason that the Picard show can't integrate the Hobus supernova into its setting. In fact, I'll even go one step further than that: I hope that the political fallout from the Hobus supernova is the the overarching theme for the show. Refugee crisis on the Romulan border? That's the perfect framing device for relevant and ""[contemplative](https://trekmovie.com/2018/12/10/alex-kurtzman-star-trek-picard-series-will-be-extremely-different-from-discovery/)"" sci-fi.",startrek,1544491526,kraetos,33,1,True,2018-12-10
